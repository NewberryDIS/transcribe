Charlie started for school this morn for the first.  when he came home for his dinner he saw his high chair at his place at the table.  he told Grandma he was not going to sit in a big chair any more.  when he leaves home he must kiss us all & goes off pleased with the thought that he goes to school.  he sits with Bertie Hughes.  It seems rather lonely without him.  Carroll grows fast and is quite a help to his papa about piling wood &c.  Mother is quite smart.  she is fixing herself a dress","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":36945,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/36945","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/1ee32b0ec68c67cae19edb75b7e5e9ba.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/1ee32b0ec68c67cae19edb75b7e5e9ba.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/1ee32b0ec68c67cae19edb75b7e5e9ba.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1ee32b0ec68c67cae19edb75b7e5e9ba.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-17T15:08:02+00:00","modified":"2018-02-09T17:04:42+00:00","filename":"1ee32b0ec68c67cae19edb75b7e5e9ba.jpg","authentication":"77cf170145801f0f2a3305f27ca80bcc","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_12_fl_445_035_03_o2.jpg","size":1089885,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2376,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042472760007482},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["yp"],"DateCreated":["20160802"],"TimeCreated":["045423+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["yp"],"DateCreated":["20160802"],"TimeCreated":["045423+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["yp"],"DateCreated":["20160802"],"TimeCreated":["045423+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1ee32b0ec68c67cae19edb75b7e5e9ba.jpg","FileDateTime":1508252579,"FileSize":1089885,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2376\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2376,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:04 10:19:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:08:02 04:54:23","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:08:02 04:54:23","ShutterSpeedValue":6.643856,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTime":2,"SubSecTimeOriginal":2,"SubSecTimeDigitized":2,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1871,"ExifImageLength":2834,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":159,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/159","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Needs Review","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"we don't know now how we could live without her.

Aug 23, 1862\nDear Sister\nI have delayed answering your kind letter longer than intended.  I have had to study pretty hard to get my lessons but I think it becomes easier as this term advances.  My grammar lessons trouble me the most.  Our teacher Mr. Burlingame, calls on some one to commence to recite the lesson without asking any questions and then on another to go on when the last one\u00a0?? and so on.  so you see we have to have our lessons all by heart word by word. I think it is pretty hard although as he says it is a good discipline for the mind.\nJoe Aldridge has got home, he is looking pretty well, although he has a hole in his heart and a handkerchief around it.  I understand he has been discharged.

Of this, the Commd'g Officer called upon, must be the judge.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69091,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69091","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/de8a88eab00c45efcb6e1ad0af2c0d8d.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/de8a88eab00c45efcb6e1ad0af2c0d8d.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/de8a88eab00c45efcb6e1ad0af2c0d8d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/de8a88eab00c45efcb6e1ad0af2c0d8d.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:03:50+00:00","modified":"2019-08-04T17:31:37+00:00","filename":"de8a88eab00c45efcb6e1ad0af2c0d8d.jpg","authentication":"1d683be5cc84f051708c811a4ed589df","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00005_o2.jpg","size":649321,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2896,"compression_ratio":0.04152093564559},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["002817+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["002817+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["002817+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"de8a88eab00c45efcb6e1ad0af2c0d8d.jpg","FileDateTime":1522339421,"FileSize":649321,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2896\"","Height":2896,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2896,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 10:03:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3955},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:22 00:28:17","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:22 00:28:17","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":10,"SubSecTimeDigitized":10,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2896,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1033,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1033","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"5\n\n               The proper course in the opinion of the Commdg'.

   If this statement is to be credited, I regard it as very important and as affording an opportunity for breaking of this traffic and, at the same time, punishing the refractory Indians.\n    That portion of it, giving names and residences of the parties Engaged, can be, I suppose easily verified by reference to the authorities in New Mexico.  Major Hatch's promise to this man, that under certain circumstances he will not be punished, and Eventually be permitted to return to his home, I believe to be invalid and void, and shall so inform him.    This man is a citizen of the United States and was captured while making war on the Government thereof, and can be pardoned by no one, but the President.\n    I have instructed major Hatch to construct an Itinerary of this man's route from Alamo Gordo on the Pecos to Fort Concho, with as much accuracy as can be done from repeated questionings of the man, giving location of Indians and all waterholes and streams, grass &c., and the distances between each.\n     This I will forward as soon as made.  It may assist the Lieut. General in determining the action, he may wish to have taken.\n     Major Hatch will also be instructed to send out a party toward the head of the Colorado, to verify his statements.  I think it will be found the only Effectual way of breaking up these raids of Cattle-stealers, is to break up their Camp on Staked Plain.  It will be Expensive and troublesome, but I see no other way.  They are not only the headquarters of all the raiding parties, but afford refuge to discontented Indians on the reservation.  I have force sufficient, I think, at Richardson, Griffin and Concho to break up their Camps, and at once, if it be thought desirable to do so.  I will do nothing more, however, than I have indicated above, until I learn what are the views of the Lieut. General.\n     He may wish to have concert of action on part of the other Departments to render the attempt more Effectual.  He may desire, too, to have time to secure the parties in New Mexico, before attempting anything here.\n                                                                                I am, Very respectfully\n                                                                                Your obdt. servant\n                                                                   (Sgd.)

This man is a citizen of the United States, captured while making war against the Government thereof.  No one can make promises of pardon and Exception from punishment, for such offences, but the President.\n    All we can do, is to promise our good offices in his case, should he be thought to deserve them.  I do not think you should have made him any promises without authority, as they will not, in all probability, be held to be valid.   The President may however, in view of valuable information and services, deem it proper to grant him pardon, but certainly not, until he has Earned it.\n    I wish you to have an Itinerary constructed from Alamo Gorda on the Pecos to Fort Concho on the route followed by this man - from information that you are able to Extract from him - giving waterholes and streams and grass, with distances between the location of Indians &c. &c., and forward to me as soon as completed.  I wish you to send out a Company of Cavalry, for a hundred miles or more, to verify his statement, and to see if the trail, which ought to be distinct, can be found, where all these Cattle were driven off.  Do not by any chance permit the prisoner to Escape.  I hope we may have much further use for him.\n                                                  Very respectfully\n                                                     Your obedtt. servant\n                                                 (Sgd.)

Dawson, both, as connected with the Scout itself, and with tone and character of his Explanation and reasons for abandoning his pursuit of Indians, while in a warm trail.  If Lieut. Dawson is satisfied with his conduct on this scout, and convinced by his reasons given for returning from pursuit, the General is of opinion the he has mistaken his profession, as it is impossible with such views, for him ever to achieve distinction in the Army or be of any use to the Government.  If he is not satisfied with himself in connection therewith, and thinks he can do better another time, the General wishes you, to give him the first opportunity that occurs to recover himself, and show what he can, or is disposed to do.\n                Such a milk and water way of pursuing Indians is throwing discredit upon the entire Army, and the General does not propose, so far as he can

The General thinks, this is the Extent, to which he can assist you.  He is not disposed, that troops shall perform any of the duties,  pertaining to civil authorities, but is [underline] disposed to protect the Civil Officers of the United States, while carrying out the orders of a U.

Meyer, 9th Cavy., detailing his operations in breaking up a Camp of armed Mexicans, twelve miles above his post, Fort McIntosh and the capture of seven Mexican Officers and thirty seven Privates with a portion of their arms and Equipments.\n                     Colonel Valdez, the reported Commander of this force, is the same who recently crossed with his command from Piedras Negras, and surrendered it with their arms to the Commanding Officer Fort Duncan.  That force was, in pursuance to orders from the Lieut. General, disbanded.\n                    The command broken up by Capt. Meyer was - I am informed - made up mostly from the force disbanded at Fort Duncan, with addition of men from this place and points on the Rio Grande.  The alleged assertion of Colonel Valdez, that he was acting with the knowledge and approval of the Dept. Commander, is of course erroneous.  Col. Valdez was expressly told by the Dep't. Commander, that if he attempted to return to Mexico with an armed or organized force it would be in violation of our soil, would make trouble and that he must not attempt it.   Col. Valdez and the captured officers report themselves as belonging to the Regular Mexican Army and to be acting in the interest of the Mexican Government.  Querazo, who commanded the Revolutionists, along the Rio Grande frontier is - I am informed - one of the Mexican Generals who were in the french interests in Mexico, that his hostility to the Government is due entirely to his personal hostility to the President, Juarez.\n                      The Officers are held prisoners and will be turned over, when called for, to the proper Federal authorities, in compliance with the telegram received from the Lieut. General yesterday.\n                                                        Very respectfully\n                                                        Your obdt. servant\n\n5 Enclosures.

I was awaiting the return of Paymaster, who was paying troops at Fort Davis, in order to see for what time Sergt. Bush was paid.

Colonel Valdez was arrested by same Officer, April 26, 1872, for alleged same offense.  The papers in the case have been forwarded to the Government and I have been instructed to retain these Officers until Civil Officers of the Government can investigate the charges against them.\n               I have no further connection with the cases, except to obey such orders as I may receive, concerning them.\n               I have this day telegraphed that the Civil Officers have as yet taken no action, and that the Officers are becoming impatient.  This may possibly hasten matters a little.\n                                         I am, very respectfully\n                                         Your obdt. servant\n                                 (Sgd) C.

General Sheridan,  \nChicago, Ills.\nGeneral,\n\n                    I have the honor to enclose a copy of a letter from Commanding Officer Fort Sill to Commanding Officer Fort Richardson, concerning threatened depredations by the Kiowa's, from their reservation, near the former post.      The Cavalry from Fort Richardson has been almost constantly employed for the past m onth, in chasing bands of Indian depredators in the Northern counties of Texas.  These bands were reported to come from the reservation, near Fort Sill, and the enclosed letter leaves no doubt, they are Kiowas.  The hundred and twenty animals stolen from the command moving from Capt Supply to Fort Hayes, were also stolen by Kiowas.\n       The Commanding Officer Fort Sill has been instructed to make a demand upon the Agent of these Indians for the return of the stolen animals, but we know very well, that this will amount to nothing.  The question then is, what is to be done with these Indians?   The popular panacea of [strike] in cases of hostile Indians - of putting them on a reservation and finding them, is not applicable in this case, as they are, or are supposed to be, already on one, and have been for years, where they are fed and cared for by the Government.  Some other remedy must be prescribed.  The Government has done for these Indians all that it can do in the way of kindness.  It has given them a good reservation, under charge of an honest and faithful agent, and supplied them with food and clothing.  Still they remain the most troublesome Indians, we have.\n         The Kiowas have always been regarded - and I believe justly - the meanest and the cruelest Indians on the Plains, and unlike the Cheyennes and many other tribes, are without a single trait or sentiment, that christian or any other ennobling principle can seize upon, to improve or elevate them, and withal, the evil in them is not dormant - but extremely active and troublesome.\n          They are in sympathy with the bad Indians in all the adjacent tribes and reservations and keep them in a constant state of excitement.\n          My recommendation in their case is, that the whole Kiowa tribe be taken possession of and disarmed, and taken entirely out of the Indian Country, and distributed among the military posts at the North - not breaking up families, and that the Kiowa's, as a tribe, be no longer recognized.  An Individuals, they can be cared for more cheaply and better than on their reservation.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69118,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69118","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/2899b7d47543352103f03f694b34a810.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/2899b7d47543352103f03f694b34a810.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/2899b7d47543352103f03f694b34a810.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2899b7d47543352103f03f694b34a810.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:04:15+00:00","modified":"2019-09-01T18:17:28+00:00","filename":"2899b7d47543352103f03f694b34a810.jpg","authentication":"ddcb13ef7d4df1a319ceb2f4f07a4399","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00019_o2

Hay was not accepted:\n                                                                                  Office of Depot Quartermaster,\n                                                                                  San Antonio, Texas, June 25, 1872.\n\nRespectfully returned to the Chief Quartermaster of the Department.\n\n        The bids received for supplying the post of Fort Brown, Tex., with hay, for the fiscal year, commencing July 1, 1872, were for the following grades or kind of hay, viz: (1st) Northern or Western at from $49. 93\/100 to $75.  00\/100 p. ton;  (2nd.) Mesquit at $39. 75\/100 p. ton and (3rd.) Prairie or \"Saca Hinsta\" at from $24. 00.100 to $ 34. 00\/100 p. ton.\n         Mr. Werbiski put in his bid at $32.  00\/100 and did not describe any particular grade.  His bid, however, was understood from the proposed, and from his failure to the kind of hay, he offered, to be for the lowest grade, as he would naturally, in the absence of any obligation, contained in his bid, to the contrary, elect and insist upon putting in the cheapest grade: - such was the course, pursued last year, by the Contractor, and the result was, that the hay presented, was found unsuitable in kind by the Receiving Board, and the Government, at great expense, obtained most of the supply from the New Orleans market.\n           Therefore, with the experience of the past in view, the bids for the lowest grades of hay were not accepted.\n            The Northern or Western hay being higher in price, and but little, if any, superior to the Mesquit hay, the bids for that were likewise not accepted, and the offer of Mr. Chamberlain for Mesquit hay in bales, was accepted.  Had it been deemed for the interests of the service, to accept Prairie or Saca Hinsta, Mr. Werbiski's offer could not have been accepted.\n                                                                 (Sgd) Benj.

T.\nColonel,\n\n                 I am sorry that the interests of the service seemed to require that the number of Companies in and about Gibson should be reduced to two.  General Sheridan thinks that number sufficient for the removal of unauthorized settlers from the Indian Territory, and that - after all - is the main object of being sent there.  I have no doubt, the Railroad would like troops at all their important points, and I am sure, they would be very useful there, but we have no troops to spare.\n                 The Indians about Fort Sill are becoming very troublesome, and making frequent raids into Texas.  The number of troops should not be diminished more than is absolutely necessary.  General Sheridan thinks the Companies from Camp Supply cannot be spared.  You will therefore have to do the best you can with two Companies, until matters become more quiet about Sill, and I do not wish you, to send away from that post any of the troops there, except in connection with the interests of that post.\n                 As it is a round-about way to send mail for Sill to Gibson, I will give my orders to the Commanding Officer of that post direct - in fact it was intended, in making a District, to give you control f posts - but only of the troops engaged in the field under your orders in removing settlers.  This is why I informed you, that no District Staff was necessary.\n                 General Sheridan believes, that you will have but little trouble in removing the objectionable settlers, when they once see, that their removal is determined upon.\n                Your chaplain, Mr. Guion, with his family will leave July first, for Gibson.  His family will be an agreeable accession to your society.\n                Please keep me informed constantly of your progress.\n                               I am Colonel, very respectfully\n                                    Your obdt. servant\n                         (Sgd)   C.

Col. Ekin, Chief Quartermaster of the Department.\n                   The Contracts, as you know, where made and completed before my assumption of command of the Department, and I can therefore in no way be held responsible either for their merit or defects.\n                  In the contracts for this year, every proper precaution in the interests of the Government, has been taken, and suitable terms in regard to deliveries embodied in the Contract.  I enclose a copy of a letter to Commanding Officers of Posts, prescribing the amount of supplies to be kept on hand at posts.\n                  These precautions will, it is thought, secure the Government against any such losses as those you refer to, at Fort Brown.\n                  In your closing paragraph, you express an apprehension that there may be other losses at other posts in the Department from the same cause.  I regret to say, that your apprehensions have already been more than realized - a recent Board of Survey of Ringgold Barracks reported as unfit for use a quantity of Corn to the value of over Six thousand Dollars, and the Commanding Officer, as special Inspector condemned it.  I have suspended action in the case however, until such time, as I can go there myself, or send my own Inspector to examine the Corn and learn more particular about it.\n                  Whenever grain is found unfit for use, I think, it should never be sold, but destroyed to prevent its ever finding its way back to Government Storehouses.\n                                                                I am, very respectfully\n                                                                  Your obdt. servant\n                                                    (Sgd)      C.

You are expected to assist the survey party in every reasonable way and consult their conveniences in whatever you do, so far as a proper regard for your own command will permit.\n                                                                  Very respectfully\n                                                                  Your obdt. servant\n\n1897.

G. B. Russell, 9th Infy., Actg. Asst. Inspector General of the Department, to Baton-Rouge, to inspect and examine into all the cases there, from this Department.\n         I have the honor to enclose herewith, for the information of the Secretary of War, his report of such inspection and examination, with his recommendations, in the cases of certain men, in his opinion deserving relief.   I enclose also copies of Special Orders, taking action in the cases of all the men, whose Regiments are serving in the Department - not feeling authorized to act in the cases of those of the 6th Cavalry and other Regiments - but at the same time respectfully invite the attention of the Department to the recommendations of Capt. Russell thereon.\n         As Capt. Russell says, no order can be found here, designating this Penitentiary as a Military Prison, and I have been, at times, in doubt, whether deserters could be properly sent there.\n         I respectfully request information, if it is designated and regarded as a Military Prison.\n         If arrangements could be made, the Penitentiary in this State made a Military Prison, it would save great expense in transporting Prisoners to Baton-Rouge.\n                                                    I am, very respectfully\n                                                            Your obdt. servant\n\n6 Enclosures.

Articles of War are sustainable under the allegations of their respective specifications.\n          The Conduct alleged in the specification to 1st charge, is a refusal to accept a civility from his Commanding Officer during an official interview.  The Specification does not, in the opinion of this Office, sustain the charge of \"disrespect\" or \"contempt\".  At most, [2 word underline] the neglect or refusal to sit down, as stated in the specification to the 2nd. charge, is a simple disobedience and is not properly chargeable as a violation of the 83rd. Article of War (see Digest Opinion J.A. G. page 3584).   The statements of the specifications to 3rd Charge are, that neglect or refusal by a subordinate to accept a courtesy from his Commanding Officer, while transacting official business, is prejudicial to good order and military discipline.  If the acts stated were accomplished by no aggravation, it seemed a strained construction of the Article, to hold that they constitute a violation of its provisions.  Paragraph 254. R. A. R. 1863, requires courtesy between Officers at all times, and Lieut. Parker may have failed to exhibit due deference for the request of Lieut. Col. Buell, but the offence does not, in the opinion of this Office, assume the gravity, which requires the trial of accused, by General Court Martial.\n                                                                                                       (Sgd) H. B. Burnham\n                                                                                                                 Major and Judge Advocate\"\n     The Commanding Officer directs me to say, that he concurs entirely in the view of Major Burnham, that the charges are untenable.  He thinks moreover that they were unnecessary and uncalled for, so far as the charges themselves or any reports in connection therewith show.      The proper and recognized position for the Officer of the Day, when receiving orders from the Commanding Officer, is standing, and it is the only position, the Commanding Officer can require him to take.   The same on visiting the Commanding Officer's Office on any official business.  If the Commanding Officer chooses to invite him to sit, it is a mere civility, which he is at liberty to decline, and this too without any imputation of want of courtesy.\n    So far as the papers show, the Commanding General sees nothing in the conduct of Lieut. Parker, to disapprove, on the contrary he commends his coolness and descretion, when subjected to irritating an improper language of his Commanding Officer.\n    Subordinate Officers have their rights, as well as their duties, and when Commanding Officers fail to respect them, it is the duty of the Commanding General so far as possible to protect them.  This duty he proposes to perform very strictly, though at the same time justly.  Very respectfully, Your obdt. servant\n                                                                                                                                                                                          (Sgd) J.

General to the Adjutant General of the Army, dated Aug. 20, 1872, in reference to Capt. N. D. A. Sawyer, Mil. Storekeeper, and which was referred to me for report.\n         At the time, Capt. Sawyer made his application to be relieved from the Department, there was nothing but suspicion, [underline] that his administration at the Victoria Depot, was irregular and possibly corrupt; and the question of his integrity did not in the least influence my endorsement, approving his application.  I approved for reasons, I will now give.\n         The Depot Quartermaster at San Antonio has charge of the Clothing there, and has no more employe's, in connection therewith, than the Mil. Storekeeper would have; and its arrangement does not interfere with the official performance of his other duties.\n         A Military Storekeeper there, is simply an Officer in excess of what is necessary, and at an Expense of his fuel and quarters.  I have made it a point too, independently of the question of expense, to reduce the number of Officers at Department headquarters to the lowest possible number.  I think it advisable for many reasons, which need not be stated.\n          Such were my reasons for saying that \"Capt. Sawyer's services as Military Storekeeper were not necessary in this Department\".  If he remained in this Department, it would be of course to go as Quartermaster to some post.  At every post, so far as I know, a Lieutenant can be selected, who will perform all the duties of the Q. M. Department at the Post, quite as efficiently as any Captain, Q. M., and less of inconvenience to the garrison, where there is always a limited allowance of Quarters.\n         The Quartermaster General remarks that: \"The frontier of Texas has many Posts at which a good, bonded officer would be useful as an Actg. Asst. Quartermaster, in charge of military property and Expenditures\".  So far as I am aware, and I think the records of the Q. M. General's Office will show, that every case of alleged fraud and corruption at the frontier, and other posts in Texas, has occurred with the same \"bonded Officers\", and not one in the care of a Lieutenant, acting as Quartermaster.  There has been but a single instance, since my coming here, of a Post Commander asking for a regular Q. M. at his post, but repeated instances, where I have been asked not to send one","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69142,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69142","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/17821a2bcf6b5060922319552d3b2676.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/17821a2bcf6b5060922319552d3b2676.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/17821a2bcf6b5060922319552d3b2676.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/17821a2bcf6b5060922319552d3b2676.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:04:37+00:00","modified":"2019-09-02T16:54:32+00:00","filename":"17821a2bcf6b5060922319552d3b2676.jpg","authentication":"f53a61eb9bd6068f0ae5a9acfcd4ef60","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00031_o2 copy.jpg","size":643187,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2890,"compression_ratio":0.041214084326541},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["004321+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["004321+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["004321+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"17821a2bcf6b5060922319552d3b2676.jpg","FileDateTime":1522339422,"FileSize":643187,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2890\"","Height":2890,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2890,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 10:03:32","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4079},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:22 00:43:21","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:22 00:43:21","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":61,"SubSecTimeDigitized":61,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2890,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1033,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1033","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"56 [stamp]\n\n   I will give the reason, assigned for it, by one of the most efficient Colonels in the Department.  He said: My Quartermaster, a Lieutenant, is up at Reveille, and down at his Corral, looking out for his animals and teamsters, and giving his personal attentions to all the details of his Department.  If I have a regular Quartermaster, he wants two or three clerks, a storekeeper, superintendent, &c., does not come to his Office before nine o'clock, and can never give information concerning his Department, until he send for one of these Employe's, to inquire of him.\"\n    Such are the reasons for the remarks in my endorsement, that even at the frontier posts the services of Capt. Sawyer are not necessary.\n    As I have already stated, at the date of Capt. Sawyer's application to be relieved, we had but a suspicion of anything wrong in his administration at Victoria.  These suspicions were subsequently strengthened to such a degree, that investigations were instituted, resulting in sending Major Card, Augurt 30th. (see S. O. Enclosed) to Victoria and Indianola, to make a searching investigation and collect the necessary evidence in the case.  It is believed now, that Capt. Sawyer was virtually his own contractor for hauling at Victoria and Indianola, furnishing, in name of his clerk, the drays and horses - paying his drivers as Q. M. Employe's - paying his clerk under two different names - tendering Vouchers for forage and fuel, without having purchased them, &c.\n    Should Major Card\n\ns investigations warrant it, and the necessary evidence can be obtained - his Chief Clerk is said to have disappeared -, he will be arrested and brought before a Court Martial.\n\n                                                    I am, very respectfully\n                                                     Your obdt. servant\n                                              (Sgd)   C.

Will you please, give me your views on this subject, drawn from your observations of the matters in that vicinity.\n              I should want this Camp kept up all winter, or as long as the weather would permit, and should frequently change the Company there, with the Cavalry Company at Duncan.\n                                                                                                I am, very truly Yours\n                                                                                        (Sgd)    C.

Referring to your communication of the 21.st. inst., the Commanding General regrets with yourself, that the state of affairs exists, as represented by you, and is glad that sudden retribution was visited upon the head of the offenders.\n                   In relation however to the case of Musician Martin Pedee, Co. \"E\", 25\" Infy., referred to by you, he wished me to inform you, that the sole responsibility for a reduction of his sentence rests with the Court, or the Judge Advocate.\n                  The proceedings have been forwarded to the Judge Advocate General of the Army, but the main facts are fresh in the memory of the Commanding General, who reviewed the case with great care.  The Evidence, as spread upon the record, failed entirely to prove an attempt at rape: nor in fact was it clearly charged in the specification, which alleges an assault and an \"attempt by force to accomplish his purpose\". (Query: what purpose?)  It has often been noticed, that, as was apparently the fact in this case, when guilt is very evident to the Officers, composing a Court, Judge-Advocates were correspondingly careless in the introduction of evidence.  The fact of an assault of some nature, appeared proved - hence the punishment of the prisoner.\n                   Further:  the reviewing Authorities thought seriously of disapproving the case in toto, for the reason that the identity of the person, making the assault was left doubtful.\n                                                                                               Very respectfully\n                                                                                               Your obdt. servant\n\nM.1665.D.T.'72.

His father came to see me to-day, concerning him and I promised to write and ask your aid in recovering him.  Although of Mexican parentage, he was born in Texas, and is an American citizen, and comes within the category of those to be restored by the Indians.\n        It is proper for me to inform you, that in the minds of those familiar with circumstances, attending the reported capture by Indians of Mrs. Fields, grave doubts exist as to whether she was really captured by Indians at all.    I enclose you copy of letter received from Lt. Col. Shafter on the subject of Mr. Fields himself admits to me, that he had doubts about it.

M.\nSir:\n\n                  Some time during 1870 - I think - a Mrs. Fields, living with her husband near Fort McKavett, Texas, disappeared and it was stated and believed at the time, that she was captured and taken away by the Indians.  Afterwards it came to be believed by many, that she was not taken by Indians but, that living unhappily with her husband, she escaped from him and went away with her brother-in-law, a Mr. Robert Casey, who resides near Fort Stanton, N. M.\n    The Indian women and children, captured by Colonel MacKenzie last fall, are still held as hostages for the return of white captives in the hands of the Indians.  They have already brought in all, who are know to have been captured, except Mrs. Fields, and they profess to know nothing of her.   This professed ignorance rather strengthens the prevailing opinion that Mrs. Fields was not captured by Indians.  As Mr. Casey resides near your Post, you will be good enough to see him and learn if Mrs. Fields is with him, or if he knows of her whereabouts.  If there is a desire to keep her concealed from her husband I have no wish or purpose to interfere with such an arrangement.  All I desire to know is, is she in the hands of the Indians?

Owing to the effects of the same disease, I have been prevented from making my visit to the Rio Grande Posts, which I contemplated doing early in January last.  My arrangements are made, to leave here on Friday next for Brownsville via Forts Clark, Duncan, McIntosh and Ringgold Barracks.  This visit will consume a month, by which time, the Fourth Cavalry will be in condition to more and I will be better able to judge of the proper sphere of their operations.\n              My present idea is, that sufficient of the Ninth Cavalry should be kept at Fort Brown and Ringgold Barracks, to meet the requirements of those Posts and vicinity, and that the Fourth should take care of that portion North from Ringgold.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69155,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69155","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/10393ed017a4f6ad61f7dcf1a7682a87.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/10393ed017a4f6ad61f7dcf1a7682a87.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/10393ed017a4f6ad61f7dcf1a7682a87.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/10393ed017a4f6ad61f7dcf1a7682a87.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:04:50+00:00","modified":"2019-09-10T20:37:25+00:00","filename":"10393ed017a4f6ad61f7dcf1a7682a87.jpg","authentication":"2a7ac5e0eb4e1e9d46140dbf3b7d8caa","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00037_o2.jpg","size":669592,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

        This will probably leave sufficient of the Ninth for McKavett and possibly Concho, enough of the Fourth Cavalry for Richardson, Griffin and perhaps Concho should be taken from the Indian country and replaced by other Cavalry.\n         After seeing the country below and learning of its actual requirements in the way of troops, this view may and probably will be modified.      It may be well too, to make that portion a District under Mackenzie and give him control of all operations against the thieves and Indians, depredating there.\n         I have also received your instructions, authorizing me to effect some arrangement on the Rio Grande.  The trouble at present is, to find such authority.  The Governors of the several States, bordering on the Rio Grande have - I am informed - a certain control of the troops acting within their States, but that the general control of military affairs is vested in General Rocha, whose Headquarters are at San Luis Potosi.  I am also informed that he is preparing to move his Headquarters to some point this side the mountains, probably to Monterey.

[left margin]\nGeneral E. D. Townsend,\nAdjutant General of the Army,\nWashington, D. C.\nGeneral,\n\n               I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of our letter of the 6th. instant, desiring to be furnished with  List of the Military Posts within this Department, receiving their supplies by the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway, with the distances of such post from the nearest station on said road.\n               In reply I have to state that the M. K, & T. R. R. has completed its connection with the Texas Central, making a continuous R. R. route from St. Louis, Mo. to Galveston, Houston and Austin, Texas.             Forts Dill, Gibson, Richardson and Griffin are being supplied now by this road.  It is proposed however for reasons following, that all the Posts in this Department - except Forts Brown, Ringgold Barracks and McIntosh, be supplied hereafter by this road and its connections as far as they extend.\n               Up to this time New Orleans has, of necessity, been the Depot for this Department, though always unfitted for it by reason of its hot and moist climate.\n               All Commissary Stores, forage and other Quartermaster's stores suffer from protracted exposure to it.  Even the mere passing through New Orleans and the Gulf Posts in summer, when they mostly arrive, effects our stores injuriously.\n              As New Orleans furnished of itself no supplies, except sugar, they are shipped from other points and remain in depot until required at Posts.  Another objection is, that stores coming that route now to San Antonio, are handled five time before reaching this place, to their great loss and deterioration.\n              By the new route, now offered by the completion of the Railroads referred to, St. Louis or Chicago naturally becomes the Depot for this Department.

I agree with Capt. Sanderson, that as the Kiowa's were notified in Council by their agent, which with Indians is the official manner of communication, that their Chiefs were to be liberated and restored to them, their disappointment will be very great if it is not done, and there is too much reason to anticipate, that it will afford a pretext for renewed hostilities along the Northern frontier of your State.\n                      I was opposed originally to the release of these Indians, but as the matter has progressed so far, that our word is passed to the Indians for their release, I apprehend much more trouble from a failure to keep such promise, than from their release and restoration.\n                       The ides of the Indians that parties in Texas shall meet them in Council, I regard as an excellent one, but it is one that I could not carry out having no authority to order of sanction such Council.  I hope the rumor is correct, that your Exellency proposes to visit these Indians in connection with the consideration of the question of the release of their Chiefs.  I cannot doubt the good effect of such visit.\n                                                                                  Very respectfully\n                                                                                   Your obdt. servant\n\n2 Enclosures.

It appears to me that the Indians talk too much and are too open and noisy in their movements to mean much. It is possible however, they have lived too long in Mexico, as to have acquired somewhat of the boisterous and demonstrative qualities of their Latin neighbors.  It will not do however to take anything for granted, and you should - as your probably are- be well prepared for their doing somewhat desperate.\n\nThe other five Companies of your Regiment should be with you before this letter reaches you; they left McKavett on the 29th except, perhaps, Heyl.  I do not hear of him, I only know his party is in and he should be on his way to you.     I have ordered two Companies of the 10th Infantry from McKavett to report to you, for temporary duty.\n\n         The transportation with O'Connell will be returned to you and we will supply him from here.\n         If you are in need of horses, perhaps it would be well for the Board - if near Denison - or other point on the Railroad, whenever they have one or two Carloads of horses, to ship them at once to Austin.\n         Strang is Quartermaster at Denison and will be instructed to ship the, if you desire it.                  Nothing new.\n         The papers are very quiet over the invasion, waiting probably to hear from the Mexican Government.  I shall write to the Government, that the men sustaining you in this one act, will not be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the situation here.  It must either require Mexico to force the Indians to leave the country or else permit our troops to follow them to their homes, whenever they raid into Texas.\n         The Government must remember too, that it is only above Laredo, the Indians participate in the cattle stealing.  Below that point it is all done by Mexicans, and it is just as important to the interests of that frontier, that they be restrained, as that the Indians should be.\n         Whether the Mexican Government will look as complacently upon our following Mexican thieves into their country, as they have upon the punishment of the Indians, it is a doubtful question, yet it is one that must arise and must be answered very soon.\n         Would it not be well to make a strong Camp at San Felipe for the two Companies of Infantry sent you, and keep a depot of supplies there for the use of parties out?  I think you should have a camp of that kind somewhere where [strike] towards the frontier, to avoid the frequent returns of Companies to Ft. Clark.\n         You can best judge however, if it is necessary or advisable.  I merely make the suggestion.  Keep yourself and myself thoroughly informed upon what is transpiring in Mexico.  Very respfy, Your obdt. servant (Sgd) C. C. Augur, Brig. Gen'l.

[left margin]\nBrigadier General E. D. Townsend,\nAdjutant General of the Army,\nWashington, D. C.\nGeneral:\n\n         I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 21 ' 73., in which you state the fact that the Descriptive List of Deserters from the 10th Infantry, for the month of March received at your office, shows eighty five desertions for that month.  You also state the desire of the Secretary of War, that an investigation be made that the cause of so large a number of desertions may be discovered, with a view of applying whatever remedy may be necessary.\n         By referring to the Regimental Return of the 10th Infantry, for March 1873., I find that seventy three of the desertions referred to, were from a detachment of Recruits enroute to the Regiment from Newport Barracks, Ky., and that these desertions occurred before the detachment reached the Regiment.  The regimental administration therefore cannot in any respect be held responsible for them.  The causes of these desertions will be found - I think in the history of the journey of this detachment from Newport Barracks, Ky., to this place and their detention in camp there.  This is given in full in the endorsement of Surgeon Hammond, Medical Director of the Department.\n         A month's confinement in an isolated camp, all intercourse with outsiders being prohibited, even with every comfort possible, will try the patients of the best of old soldiers.  Its effect upon a party of Recruits in a strange country, with no Espirit-de-corps, or common bond of sympathy to keep them together, can easily be imagined.  The result was that nearly one half deserted.  The sole reason assigned for these desertions, and I believe the true one, was the impatience of restraint, their isolation and the apprehension that they might themselves become victims of the small pox.\n         Strange as it may appear to Surgeon Eben Swift, U.S.A., the civilization of the Nineteenth Century and the humanizing influence of a purer Christianity seem to have lost their hold upon this detachment of Recruits on this occasion.\n         Surgeon Swift's assertion that \"Varioloid\" does not spread Contagion, is not regarded here as well founded, but even if it were, it would make no difference in the community, which does not recognize these nice distinctions and are quite as apprehensive of contagion from Varioloid as from small pox, and it is believed that even Dr. Swift were to attempt much to march through, to spare settlements and villages in Texas, a detachment of Recruits known to have Varioloid, that a brief experience would reconcile him to the \"delay and great inconvenience of Quarantining 150 raw Recruits on the Prairies of Texas.\"    The last detachment of Recruits from the 4th Cavalry, arriving here last month, had to be quarantined for ten days,

Division of the Missouri,\nChicago, Ills.\nDear General,\n\n                              I have had the honor to receive your telegram of the 27th of May, wherein you state that the Government will sustain Col. MacKenzie's action in pursuing the hostile Indians into Mexico and punishing them there.   This information has been communicated to Col. MacKenzie and cannot fail to be as gratifying to him as it is to me.\n         It has been a very disheartening situation for troops to see the country, they are expected to protect, devastated by a lot of Savages and robbers, who escape their merited punishment by crossing into Mexico and then turning and laughing at their pursuers.  It is difficult to  understand why the Government has submitted to this so long and not authorized the pursuit into Mexico before.\n         MacKenzie's act must - it is believed - bring the matter to a focus now, and I trust it may eventuate in a satisfactory solution of our difficulties on our Rio Grande frontier.\n         The Indians must be compelled to leave Mexico permanently or our troops must have full  authority to pursue them into Mexico, without interference by the Mexicans, whenever they depredate upon our side of the river.  Nothing short of these alternatives will settle permanently, the Indian question.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69163,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69163","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/698347d473b9dc198c5feac8ab165af5.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/698347d473b9dc198c5feac8ab165af5.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/698347d473b9dc198c5feac8ab165af5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/698347d473b9dc198c5feac8ab165af5.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:04:57+00:00","modified":"2019-09-03T18:12:45+00:00","filename":"698347d473b9dc198c5feac8ab165af5.jpg","authentication":"08ff6f390c26be179799afdb18048cec","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00041_o2.jpg","size":765820,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2866,"compression_ratio":0.049483083921325},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["004821+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["004821+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["004821+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"698347d473b9dc198c5feac8ab165af5.jpg","FileDateTime":1522339423,"FileSize":765820,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2866\"","Height":2866,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2866,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 10:03:41","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4567},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:22 00:48:21","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:22 00:48:21","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":14,"SubSecTimeDigitized":14,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2866,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1033,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1033","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"77 [stamp]\nBut aside from the complications arising from the presence of the hostile Indians in Mexico, there remains the more important question of the continued depredations on the Texas frontier made by the Mexicans themselves.  So far as i have knowledge, the Indians have never operated below Laredo.  All the cattle - and horsestealing below that point, and it embraces much the larger operations and much of that above, is committed by Mexicans themselves.\n\n         It is quite as important to the peace of that frontier, that the Mexicans be restrained from these robberies, as that the Indians should be.      Suppose the question of the Indians to be settled by their removal or by permission for our troops to follow them into Mexico, will the Mexican Government permit us to follow into Mexico and punish their own citizens, engaged in the same nefarious traffic?\n         It is very doubtful, yet it must be done, or the robberies will not cease so long as there are cattle and horses left on that frontier for them to steal.\n         The Mexican Government if inclined to so so, cannot stop it, and it has not the power.  I have received the communication from the State Department, sent me from your Headquarters, containing a despatch from the Mex. War Department stating that orders have been given by it, to have the cattle-stealing on the Rio Grande frontier watched and restrained.  To one familiar with the actual state of affairs in Mexico, such an order is simply amusing.  It is well know here, that such an order to the Mexican States on the Rio Grande would be about as much regarded as one of mine.  From latest information on the subject, not a Mexican federal soldier was East of the Sierra Madre, Except one small battallion of Infantry at Matamoras.  The only other Mexican troops on the Rio Grande are 50 or 60 State troops of Coahuila at Piedras negras, opposite Fort Duncan.  What prospect is there then with such a force, to effectually watch and restrain a traffic, which constitutes the principal occupation of the great body of the idle and disorderly population of that frontier, receiving, as it does, the countenance and protection of a powerful General of the Mexican Service - Cortinas-, powerful from the very fact of his controlling this ill-disposed and unruly element.     General Cortinas lives near the Rio Grande, about midway between Matamoras and Carnargo, and the fact is fully recognized there that he is more powerful in the State of Tamaulipas, than either the Federal or State Governments, so that whatever action the Mexican Government may take on the question of our frontier relations, unless it is approved by Cortinas, it cannot be carried out on the part of the Government.  You must be aware of this yourself, and I hope the Government will understand it too, when it comes to negociate.\n         The real Mexican Government, so far as affairs on the Rio Grande are concerned, is whoever controls the great crowd of

I immediately telegraphed the state of affairs to Lieut. General Sheridan and for instructions regarding the return of the prisoners to Fort Duncan and what to do in case the Commissioners were detained by the Indians, as advised to do by the leading citizens of Santa Rosa.  I expressed to him my disapproval of the request of sending the prisoners to Fort Duncan.  I have heard from him to-day, he states that he is entirely opposed to the request of the Commissioners, but has forwarded it to Washington.  No action can be taken until the Authorities there are heard from.   Meanwhile I can refer to other matters: - If you have a favorable opportunity to go for the Lepans and Mescalleros do so, and be careful about your guides; Mexican guides should be used with great caution; do not let them get you into a tight place.  As long as our Commissioners desire to talk with the Kickapoos, so long refrain from any attack upon them, but as soon as the Commissioners have done with them, they are your chickens and you can gather them, whenever a favorable opportunity occurs.  I do not think it advisable that you write to Governor Cepede or to any other Mexican Official, except on matter of routine.  no explanations are necessary for us, except to our own Government, and whatever explanations the Mexican Officials may want, can be obtained through their own Government from ours.  Neither do I think it necessary to find out any precedents - none are necessary - but if they are, our Government is fully cognizant of everything that has transpired on this frontier for years.  Do not ask of Valdez, or for any other person, as Mexican Commander for the frontier, if ever so desirable; I fear that our request might act an as impediment to his coming.

The accompanying Plan of the Post shows in black lines the buildings now completed, and in red lines the buildings necessary to give capacity for Eight Companies of Cavalry and three of Infantry.  The dimensions of the contemplates structures are given and it will be seen that the smallest possible have been adopted.\n         They will have to built of Stone - that being the cheapest material available - cheaper even than adobes, there being a stone-quarry easily worked, directly at the Post.  The Stables are to be built entirely by the Companies occupying them and the only expense I have permitted to be incurred for them is the sheathing and shingles for roofs and for stalls and feedboxes.  Most of the roofing for all the buildings is also to be put on by the troops and their services will be made available too, as far as practicable, in quarrying and laying the stone in the wall.  All the Lumber and shingles will be hauled by our own teams, mostly from Austin or Cuero; Civilian Masons and Carpenters and a few experienced Quarrymen will have to be Employed and I have authorized the hiring of as many as can work to advantage in the expectation of completing the Quarters for use the approaching winter.\n         I enclose a copy of the Estimate made by the Commanding Officer, Quartermaster and Chief Mechanic at Fort Clark and it comes - as you will observe - within the seventh thousand authorized; I desire, if possible, to save sufficient to build fences around the Post and Quarters.  Every effort will be made to complete the Post as contemplated within the allowance made for the purpose and from the present appearances I think it can be done.  I am Very respfry.\n\nYour obdt servant )Sgd) C. C. Augur  Brig. Gen'l. U.S.A.

It is about the same in character and importance now, that it was in Forty Eight, and as it probably will be for forty eight years hence.  The Country between the Nueces and the Rio Grande can never be anything but a grazing Country, affording opportunity and facilities for predatory bands of thieves, Indian or Mexican - and Americans too, for that matter.\n         The Government can now, as well as hereafter, determine at what points of the frontier it desires to have troops.  Having so determined, I do not see, but it is as well to purchase those site, if the price asked is reasonable.  With the Northern frontier of Texas it is quite different.  Affairs there are changing every year, new settlements are springing up and advancing constantly.  The pioneers and frontiersmen are pushed ahead every day.  The advance too of the Southern Pacific Railroad will increase this change very materially, so that it will be almost impossible to say one year where the troops may be required the next.  On this changing frontier, I do not think it advisable for the Government to purchase Military Sites, so long as they can be leased on reasonable terms.  In this category should be included all the Posts in Texas, North of Clark and Duncan.  It may be said however, that the time of completion of this Railroad is so uncertain, and the consequent changes on the frontier so remote, that the rents paid for the sites of those Posts would pay for the sites themselves meanwhile.  This may be so, still there will be changes on that frontier whether the Railroad is completed or not, though perhaps no sufficient to involve any change of Posts.  Where there is so little that is fixed and definite concerning them, I do not recommend any expenditure for Military Sites - particularly, when we have satisfactory leases for them during the pleasure of the Government.\n                                                                                    Very respectfully\n                                                                                      Your obdt. servant\n                                                                              (Sgd)   C.

statement given by \"Kicking Bird,\" Kiowa Chief, and communicated in a letter by the Commdg. Officer Fort Sill, I. T. dated may 20. 1874, is furnished for your information: -\n\n\"Some time since all Comanches were ordered to move to \"Pecan\" or \"Elk\" Creek to join in a grand Medicine dance.  The result of the dance and council was a determination to war against the whites in general, and Texas and the Texans in particular.  To the Comanches were joined the Cheyennes, in this determination.  They were divided into several parties - one of which was to move toward the Fort Sill Reservation and Agency and steal the best stock available.  The others to move West to a certain stronghold, there to remain until the return of the first party, then to move into Texas in detached parties.  This first party stole the stock of the Agent and Mr. William Maden.  They were seen by the Kiowas, heading towards their rendezvous and driving the stock.  In their passage to their camp on \"Pecan Creek\", they ran off five horses belonging to \"Kicking Bird\" and \"Stumbling Bear\".  The only Comanches known to be peacably inclined are \"Esse-Tu-Et\" and \"To-Su-wa\".  The Kiowas are joining \"Kicking Bird,\" who intents to move all the camps to the vicinity of this Post. There will not be a Kiowa on the warpath this summer.\"\n\n                                                                                              Very respectfully\n                                                                                                Your obdt servant\n\nCONCHO, [left margin]                                                      (Sgd)   J.

Officer Fort Brown, Texas, forwarding one (copy enclosed) from Colonel Haynes, the U. S. Collector of Customs at Brownsville, Texas, alleging that Captain Benavides, Commanding a Company of Texas Rangers had orders from the Governor of Texas, when in pursuit of Indians or Cattle Thieves, to cross the Rio Grande and follow them into Mexico, and expressing apprehension that the Execution of such orders would lead to serious trouble on that frontier.\n                I immediately telegraphed the Governor of Texas (copy enclosed) that I had received such report, and that, if Texas troops were acting under such orders, I thought it important, I should know and that, if he saw no objection, I would respectfully inquire if such orders existed.  He replied that he would send me a copy of orders by next mail.  He did so, and copies of his reply and of the orders and instructions are Enclosed.\n               It will be seen from them, that Texas troops, operating between the Nueces and Rio Grande, have such orders, and that it rests Entirely in the discretion of the Officer in Command, when occasion will justify the crossing his troops into Mexico.\n               There are no Indians operating so low down on the Rio Grande.  The only depredators there are Cattle Thieves, and they unfortunately may furnish the occasion at any moment.  The result is readily foreseen.

In the present condition of affairs on the line of the Rio Grands, the fact of strange Mexicans being engaged in gathering and branding Cattle, is a very suspicious circumstance and one, requiring on the part of those engaged in breaking up illicit Cattle Traffic - not perhaps the arrest of the parties - but at all events careful inquiry as to the legitimacy of the transaction, and it seems to me that honest dealers cannot object to this - if not offensively done - as it is an act entirely in their interest.\n                                                                                                     Very respectfully\n                                                                                                       Your obdt. servant\n                                                                                              (Sgd)   C.

From copies of enclosed telegrams it will also be seen that his Officer escaped from the guard placed over him, and is not at large.\n         During my visit to Fort Brown in April last, the Commdg.

C. S. at the Post.  I said this officer should at least be relieved from that duty, and he was accordingly relieved the 27th April by Lieut.

Nothing further was heard of the case and it was supposed everything was settled.\n          On June 23rd. I received from the Commd'g. Officer Fort Brown the telegram, copy enclosed (3), to which I answered, see copies of telegrams, (4 and 5.), on 24th. was received telegram, copy enclosed (6.), and on July 6th., the one, copy enclosed, marked (7.), since then nothing has been heard of Lieut. Neely.\n          It will be seen that the amount of funds reported on hand to the Commanding General by Lieut. Neely, April 25th, is substantially the amount as reported to Major Russell on the 27th, and verified by him as on hand - $2000.00 of it being a Check on Assistant Treasurer at New York, drawn by Paymaster Nicholls.  It would appear that subsequently Lieut. Neely induced the Paymaster to receive back this check and return the funds given for it.

The Companies at Sabinal and Kerreville will be sent direct to McKavett or Concho to await your orders.  A hundred (100) Recruits from you Regiment are now Enroute to Fort Clark from St. Louis; some of them probably are old soldiers and may be available.  If not, you can talk half of Each Company left at Clark and Duncan and divide the Recruits among these Companies for instruction until your return.  As it is not probable you will return before late in the fall, proper provision should be made to take Clothing along, or it can be sent you later.\n         With regard to Major Bankhead's command, now beyond the Pecos, as I understand, you had better sent Couriers with orders for him to march without delay to Concho.\n         The other Companies should be put in march as soon as practicable for Concho.  You had better, I think, come here in person and thence direct to Concho by stage.\n         This will enable us to settle at once upon a plan of operations and to arrange for carrying it out.

He had not received the order for his movement, but came in to see me in other matters.\n         He started back to Fort Clark last night to give the necessary orders for putting the Companies of his Regiment in motion.\n         A hundred Recruits for his Regiment will be here to-morrow, and will go immediately on.  He wishes them to arrive at Fort Clark before he starts, and they can do so before the Companies from the Pecos can, as the latter have to hunted up.\n         We had talked the matter over very fully, and I have agreed with him upon what should be done, that is in our opinion I assume that the troops once in position on the Northern frontier of Texas, that no force of Indians - or if any - but very small parties will be found inside the line of such troops, and that therefore the number of troops at the several Posts may be much reduced during these operations.\n         I will leave Clark two Companies each of Cavalry and Infantry.  Duncan, McKavett, Concha, Davis and Stockton each two Companies of Infantry and one of Cavalry.  Griffin possibly with one of each and Richardson two of each.  With regard to Sill, I cannot say definitely, until I hear more fully from Davidson.  This will enable me to give Mackenzie to operate with from his Old Supply Camp at [strike] on Fresh Fork of Brazos nine (9) Companies of Cavalry and four (4) of Infantry.\n         Buell to operate with, between MacKenzie and Davidson, four Companies of Cavalry and two of Infantry.\n         Davidson, who should establish a Supply Camp near Otter Creek, from which to cooperate with the others.\n         I propose to give six Companies of Cavalry and two of Infantry, and still leave three of Each arm, to look after Fort Sill.  If that is not regarded as sufficient for Fort Sill, I may be able to give another Company of Infantry from Richardson.\n         These Columns, acting together, can soon clean out all hostile Indians to the Kansas line.  I think it important however that the troops from the Department of Missouri shall act in concert - the Sixth Cavalry from Camp Supply, or in advance, and the Cavalry from New Mexico, via Fort Bascom, and along the heads of the streams rising in the Staked Plains.\n         This would seem to close all avenues of Escape for the Indians, Except in small parties.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69193,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69193","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/aeca08c7ceeb166f63edb66ac7480126.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/aeca08c7ceeb166f63edb66ac7480126.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/aeca08c7ceeb166f63edb66ac7480126.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/aeca08c7ceeb166f63edb66ac7480126.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:05:25+00:00","modified":"2019-09-15T19:03:15+00:00","filename":"aeca08c7ceeb166f63edb66ac7480126.jpg","authentication":"763aafebf63471ee4e4a7fb0fd88dc6a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00056_o2.jpg","size":671021,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

   This plan, if efficiently carried out, as I do not doubt it would be, would result in a severe punishment of the refractory Indians and give the frontier quiet for some time.  It would involve perhaps a campaign in a part at least of the winter season, and considerable expense and unless it can be carried out to its conclusion, it is hardly worth while perhaps to commence it.\n     I see already that many of the Eastern papers have declared \"there is not going to be much of a shower after all\" - that there are only a hundred and fifty Indians hostile, and that they have been driven to it, by bad frontiersmen &c. &c.

They have since succeeded in striking the Indians at a number of points, and although they have not killed many, they have destroyed a great deal of their property and captured many horses and caused great distress amongst them.\n    From latest reports a majority of the hostile Indians had come into their several Agencies and surrendered themselves unconditionally.\n    It is the intention to keep troops out during the winter in pursuit of such bands as do not come in and surrender like others.\n    While I do not anticipate any trouble from Indians on the Northern frontier of Texas, during the approaching winter or indeed for some years to come, still it is possible that, while the great body of the several Nations may come in and be disarmed and dismounted and be perfectly quiet, a few of the young men may remain out and may commit depredations - while this is possible, I do not regard it as at all probable.\n    I believe it to be the intention of the Government to have these Indians thoroughly subdued and rendered incapable of further depredations for years to come.\n    I return to Fort Sill next Monday and shall remain there until the Indian question in that locality is settled, as far as it can be.\n    I do not anticipate any state of affairs on your frontier requiring the presence of State troops.                       I am, respectfully   Your obdt. servant\n                                                                                                                                                               (Sgd)    C.

General Sheridan,\nChicago, Ills.\nDear General,\n\n                      On my way here I met at Denison the transportation Contractor, Mr. Graham, who told me that the Quartermaster here had control of his teams of sufficient capacity to haul one hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and that he could at once procure transportation to take about same amount from Caddo.  Believing this, I telegraphed you to send supplies for the Post on McClellan's Creek via Caddo.  On my arrival here, I find that the Qr. Mr. here has not one single team belonging to Mr. Graham and has never had but eleven teams of his, and they made but one trip.  I begin to feel that Mr. Graham is not reliable and that he may be equally wrong about the other teams, he promised from Caddo.  Under these circumstances the freight for the camp had better not be sent until something definite is known.  The trains in the field are much word down. Davidson lost about a hundred animals in the last sleet storm and I fear others have lost also.  I doubt if we can depend upon our own transportation for anything more, until after they are thoroughly rested and fed up.  My impression just now is, that it would be better to withdraw the columns from the field in December into nearest Posts, and let them recuperate until some time in February.  Then send them out afresh and keep them out as long as is desirable.\n\nMeantime the Indians would hardly know the troops are withdrawn until they saw them again.  I believe it would same immensely in animals and in the health and morale of the men, and do not believe it would effect injuriously the question of ultimate surrender of all the Indians.   Please tell me what you think of it.  Meantime the question of the Camp on McClellan Creek could be definitely arranged, as also the question of supplies.  The latter could be collected here with trains ready to start at the proper time and as the Fourth [strike] Tenth Cavalry goes to Concho, they can go with these stores to that Camp and meet MacKenzie with his Command there, to exchange transportation.  A good many Indians have gone to the Pecos and to the Guadalupe mountains.  I will have to organize a force in the spring to clear these places.

Division of the Missouri,\nChicago, Ills.\nDear General Sheridan,\n\n                                      I found Colonel Morrow, 9th Cavy. here with three Companies of his Regt. He was detached from Buell's Command on the 2. Novbr. with these Companies to follow a trail of Indians with orders to follow it until it run out or he found the Indians, and then to come to this place and await Col. Buell's arrival.  The trail ran out on head of Elk Creek, and the Indians proved to be those captured by Major Schofield's Command.  Of these three Companies between eighty and ninety good man and horses are available for further field service.\n  Buell will be at his Supply Camp about 8. Decbr. - He has but about eighty Cavalry with him, and they well used up, I know.  I propose that Morrow with his ninety men shall meet Buell at his Camp and take enough of his transportation to carry thirty days supplies, and then proceed to scout along and South of Red River and over to Pease River and to MacKenziej's Supply Camp, and thence to Concho.\n\nBuell with his Command and such of his Command as are here recuperating, with balance of his transportation, will go at once to Griffin to recuperate.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69208,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69208","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/2e5f9dc00391088485a649c00b6c7378.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/2e5f9dc00391088485a649c00b6c7378.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/2e5f9dc00391088485a649c00b6c7378.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2e5f9dc00391088485a649c00b6c7378.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:05:38+00:00","modified":"2019-09-04T18:19:18+00:00","filename":"2e5f9dc00391088485a649c00b6c7378.jpg","authentication":"53ed8dd88242ca316d400b2cb3b027f8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00064_o2 copy.jpg","size":784289,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2887,"compression_ratio":0.050307829478249},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["005811+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["005811+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["005811+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"2e5f9dc00391088485a649c00b6c7378.jpg","FileDateTime":1522339424,"FileSize":784289,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2887\"","Height":2887,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2887,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 10:04:02","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5223},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:22 00:58:11","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:22 00:58:11","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":99,"SubSecTimeDigitized":99,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2887,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1033,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1033","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"122\nCol. Davidson reached here day before yesterday.  His Command will be in to-day, but not in time to give you a report of its condition, except that the horses are badly up and there are three comparatively fresh Companies of Cavalry at the post.  Them I shall send out in a few days with supplies for December.  They will go North of North Fork of Red River, probably along the line of the Washita and towards the Canadian; and generally were there may be a chance of finding Indians.  I am more than ever satisfied that the views expressed in my last letter of withdrawing the troops during January and February is advisable.  We have pretty reliable information that the Ina-ha-di Comanches and some of the Kiowas - there are but about eighty Kiowa men absent - and even some of the Cheyennes have gone to the Pecos and to the Guadalupe Mountains.  This will leave but very few Indians out, and they, with but few horses and those much broken down - not of sufficient importance to warrant breaking down our own mules and horses pursuing the.  By the last of February we can be in good condition for taking the field again.  I believe the Indians will then be worse off, evern than they now are, while our troops will be fresh as well as our animals.\nCol. Davidson informs me, as also other officers, that the water in McClellan's Creek at low water, such as it was when they were last there, is very bad, while that on the North Fork opposite was good.\nThis will have to be considered in selecting ground for the Camp.\nDo you propose to have merely a cantonment, or to build a permanent post?    Of the Indian Stock turned over to the Qr. Mr. Dep't. here, a great many have died from exposure and many have been killed.   There are only about nine hundred remaining and those in wretched condition.  I have directed the Qr. Mr. to advertise them for sale on 15th of next month.  We had a severe snowstorm here, night before last and snow was on the ground all the day after.  Poor animals, like ours, cannot stand many of such storms.  There are about eighty Indians confined here, a great majority of them are innocent probably of [strike] for many years back, but hardly any but have connected with stealing parties, though it is doubtful if legal proof of even this can be had.  I have sent word to Kicking Bird of the Kiowas and to Cheever of the Comanches, that if they will have pointed out to me the men who were engaged in the murders committed the last summer, with proof of same, I will release the Indians [strike] balance.  I have as yet had no reply.  If none of these men can be convicted of their crimes, I shall recommend that all of them, who have heretofore been turbulent and troublesome and notoriously connected with raiding parties, be sent out of the Country for many years, and until matters here are permanently settled upon a basis, that their return would not be likely to disturb.   I should suppose that the Dry Tortugas - or Ship Island would be a suitable residence for them. But whatever course is adopted for the, the same should be applied to the Cheyennes and all others, engaged","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69209,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69209","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/ba619ea52237abcfd8633e4a8e964ac0.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/ba619ea52237abcfd8633e4a8e964ac0.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/ba619ea52237abcfd8633e4a8e964ac0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ba619ea52237abcfd8633e4a8e964ac0.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:05:39+00:00","modified":"2019-09-06T17:28:40+00:00","filename":"ba619ea52237abcfd8633e4a8e964ac0.jpg","authentication":"cf399e8cf2d1cfd4ef56db12dd546cac","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00064_o2.jpg","size":677985,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2887,"compression_ratio":0.043489012046338},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["005811+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["005811+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["005811+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ba619ea52237abcfd8633e4a8e964ac0.jpg","FileDateTime":1522339424,"FileSize":677985,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2887\"","Height":2887,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2887,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 10:04:02","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4406},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:22 00:58:11","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:22 00:58:11","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":99,"SubSecTimeDigitized":99,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2887,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1033,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1033","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"123\nin hostilities.  Since writing the above, I have conversed again with Col. Davidson and other Officers, on the subject of McClellan's Creek.  They unite in saying, that the water question would not be an objection.  They say however, that there is very little wood there - not enough to last four Companies one winter and there is no wood near there.

The General desires you to scout up Red River, looking for Indians on either side to vicinity of Mulberry Creek, then to cross over to Pease River, up it to near where MacKenzie's trail crosses it, thence, if there be no further prospect of finding Indians to proceed to Fort Concho with your Command, reporting your arrival immediately to Department Headquarters.\n                Should you meantime succeed in finding Indians, you are to pursue them vigorously in whatever direction they may lead, and as long as the condition of command may permit.

I enclose copies of my instructions to them.   I want to get the 9th towards Fort Clark as soon as possible, as there are a few Indians on the lower Pecos, that must be cleaned out in the Spring.  Two days since two of Mowaway's sons came in; they are youngsters and say they left their father on Staked Plains.     Last night the Qua-ha-dies, who had gone into the Wichita Agency and surrendered there arms, were brought here.  They belonged to the party struck by MacKenzie early in November on Staked Plains.  They have been since that time coming in.  Their information is not important, they report a few lodges of Kiowas and five lodges of Cheyennes at some point on head of Brazos, and that the Qua-ha-dies under Otter Belt, and some Cheyennes, are on Pecos toward Guadalupe Mountains.      They report Mowaway and his people are anxious to come in.   Kicking Bird has given me the names of four of his people now confined here in Ice house, who participated in the murders, in this vicinity, last summer.  Horseback has given the names of three Comanches likewise engaged in those murders.  I shall in consequence release from confinement ten of the Kiowas and a few of the Comanches.  This is done however with the distinct understanding that these Chiefs are responsible for them, and will return them when required, and has nothing to do with the final settlement by the Government with these tribes.  It is merely done to relieve the crowd in the Ice house, which is the best available place for their confinement.  Those temporarily released are either quite old or very young.  From those accused I think we can eventually obtain names of others and may succeed in convicting the worst characters.   I doubt if it is best to proceed to extremities until the Cheyennes and all the others have come in.\n                                                                          Very respectfully\n                                                                           Your obdt. servant\n                                                               (sgd)     C.

General Sheridan\nChicago, Ills.\n\n                   Your dispatches of December first and second just received.  Have not heard from MacKenzie, but believe his command to be unfit for further work now, and think it should be drawn in at once to recuperate.  He can have a fresh Command ready by last of February.  Meanwhile I can establish the Camp on McClellan Creek from this post.  Schofield with four good Cavalry Companies and two of Infantry can leave here between fifteenth and twentieth, with thirty days supplies, adn with more if teams can be had from Contractors or can be hired.  \n    I send this by messenger, who should reach Caddo Monday.  I will be there Tuesday ready for your answer.  Supplies must be sent from Camp Supply to meet this command, as I do not think we can depend upon our contractor for much.\n                                                                                  (Sgd) C.

I was fearful your command had suffered more from the storm than, thanks to your good judgement, it appears to have done - you have accomplished in common with the other columns all I expected and all you could have done and I am entirely satisfied with all.  I want you all now to get back as easily as you can to your posts and to put your command in good order for early work in the spring.  Morrow told me you has twenty seven wagons, though as I told him, I could not make it out.  You may keep your Hdqrs. team and Morrison may come in by Sill by returning train and take his chances for transportation to Richardson.  This will relieve you a little on the transportation question.  Nolan had better invoice his property to the proper Officers here and get other when he gets below.\n            Conline's wife is about to be confined and I gave him a months leave.

MIL. Div. [left margin]\nDear General Sheridan,\nChicago, Ills.\n\n                      Your telegram of Decbr 1st. reached me in such an imperfect shape that I could not make much of it, except that you wanted the Camp on McClellan Creek established this winter.  I immediately answered by my telegram of the fourth, which I sent by special messenger and which I suppose you have received, it being too late to stop it, when I received your telegram of the 3rd. instant, which you stated was your final determination in the matter of winter operations.  I immediately ordered MacKenzie in with his command - this will bring him in about last of December - and shall arrange at once with him in person for starting with his command for McClellan Creek by first of March promptly.\n       By that time too I will have a column of 9\" Cavalry from Clark operating on the Pecos.  McCuskan is just down from the Cheyenne Agency and reports that Colonel Neill has sent a messenger to the Cheyennes to tell them to come in.  If this be so, it would seem to be a departure from the policy towards these Indians, that I had supposed to be authorized and prescribed.  The Indians here say that every Kiowa and Comanche would come in at once, could they be assured, the troops would not interfere with them on the way.  I have thought it best to hold out no inducement for these people to come in,\nbut to let them remain out until fatigue and hunger forced them in.\n       They will be the better for it hereafter.  But if the Cheyennes have been invited in, I think the same course should be pursued towards the Kiowas and Comanches.  The Indians here complain too, that while their people here, who were captured or surrendered, are kept in confinement, the Cheyennes are permitted to live in Camp with their people.  I do not know if this be true or if it is very material if it is true.\n        Although Lt. Col. Davidson desired to go on the Scout, which left here on Monday last and was originally ordered to command","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69216,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69216","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/07805241f2d9927358e631279a967c69.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/07805241f2d9927358e631279a967c69.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/07805241f2d9927358e631279a967c69.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/07805241f2d9927358e631279a967c69.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:05:46+00:00","modified":"2019-08-27T17:37:25+00:00","filename":"07805241f2d9927358e631279a967c69.jpg","authentication":"50ba7b55fb9127c1a9d41db7728256d3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00068_o2 copy.jpg","size":659984,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2898,"compression_ratio":0.042173657439358},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["005911+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["005911+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["005911+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"07805241f2d9927358e631279a967c69.jpg","FileDateTime":1522339425,"FileSize":659984,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2898\"","Height":2898,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2898,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 10:04:05","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4138},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:22 00:59:11","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:22 00:59:11","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":98,"SubSecTimeDigitized":98,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2898,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1033,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1033","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"130\nit, I thought it best, for some reasons, to send Major Schofield in command and keep Col.

Novbr. directing the sale at such points in Texas, as I may consider most advantageous to the interests involved, of all the Indian animals captured from Indians, who have been hostile, &c.\n                  On my arrival here, I was advised by the Qr. Mr. who had charge of the animals in question, that they were in very poor condition - that many had died and a number killed, who were about dying, and that they should be sold as soon as possible.  I inquired about sending them to Texas.  He replied that the ponies were not in condition to go to Texas and that if it were attempted to drive them there, half of them would die.  Under these circumstances, as I have already reported, to the Lieut. General, I ordered their sale here and they are already advertised for sale on the 16th inst.  - Meantime at the urgent request of Lt. Col. Buell, I gave to his Tonkawa Scots, who during the summer's operations had lost most of their own stock worn down by hard service - on hundred of these ponies.  These Indians live at Fort Griffin and receive no annuities [2 word underlined], nor in fact anything from the Indian Department.  The have been our faithful scouts for the past three years and are deserving of consideration and I recommend that this gift be approved.  I also authorized each officer who had been out during the summer to select one of these ponies for himself.  Their value is very little and they were desired mostly as a memento [underline] of the Summer's Campaign. Orders have been given for a strict accountability of these animals.  Please see order enclosed.\n                     Amongst the animals taken from the Indians were about eighty mules, including twenty taken from Kicking Bird, who should be compensated for his.

General, to convene at this post a Military Commission for the trial of certain of the Kiowa and Comance Indians.\n                    In his letter to me of Decr. 3., the Lt. General expresses his opinion that these Indians should be tried at once, unless I have some good reasons to still delay.\n                   The only question about delay is, as to its effect upon the Indians still out.  It is known that the worst Indians of the Kiowas & Comanches have not yet come in.  Lone Wolf, Big Bow, Black Swan and others, who have been the instigators and leaders of most of the outrages for the past two years.  If they see men, whom they know to be less guilty than themselves - tried and punished, and sent into confinement, they will know for a certainty, what they must expect and it may decide them to not come in at all, and to give us much trouble hereafter.   I merely suggest this for the consideration of the Lieut. General.  If he deems it of sufficient importance to warrant a delay, please notify me.  Otherwise I shall order the Commission to meet here about the middle of January.  This will give time for the scouts under Majors' Schofield and Morrow to return, and perhaps more Indians will come in.  Meantime, I shall order the Judge Advocate here to collect and arrange the evidence in several cases.  Referring to your letter of Nov. 23., in reference to selecting certain of these Indians for confinement, I would respectfully suggest, that I be not required to make such a list until the meeting of the Commission, when the facts concerning these people and their acts will be better known and I shall be more competent to make a proper selection.

MIL. DIV.\nDear General Sheridan,\n\n                                       I desire to call your attention to a few matters here, connected with the Indian Department, which in my judgment require attention.  The Indian Agent here agrees with me, so I can speak without impropriety, and should you see fit, please forward this to the Indian Commissioner.\n             The Pen-e-teth-Ra Band of Comanches, which belongs to this Agency, is permitted by authority, from the Commissioner or from the Superintendent, Mr. Hoag, to live at the Wichita Agency.\n               The consequence is, that part of the band live at each Agency and are constantly going to and from each.  I think it important that the whole Comanche Nation should be at this Agency, where it belongs, and where all questions affecting the Nation are considered and settled.  Tosh-a-way and a large portion, probably the largest portion, desire to return here in the Spring, and I promised Tosh-a-way, I would ask to have it done.  There is quite a band of Pawnees at the Wichita Agency.  The Indians here complain that they are great horse-thieves, which is not difficult to believe of that tribe.  I requested, nearly a year ago, that the Pawnees at the Agency be required to return to their proper reservation.  I again respectfully renew the request, as I regard them as a disturbing element in this vicinity.\n                I think some provision should be made by the Indian Department for the Tonkaway's.  They have heretofore been hostile against Comanches and Kiowas, but after this summer's operations I think they could be brought to this reservation without any danger and be provided for, like other tribes.  There are but a few of them, but they are good Indians and deserve attention.  They now receive nothing from the Government, except such as are enlisted as Scouts.\n                                                                          Very respectfully,\n                                                                           Your obdt. servant\n                                                               (Sgd)    C.

In addition I had a section of Mountain Howitzers under Lieut. Kelliher, 25th Infy., and a detachment of 44 Indian Scouts under Lieut. Pratt, 10th Cavy.\n         I had a train of 46 wagons under Lieut. Beck, R. Q.

Carlton 10th Cavy., reaching there the 11th of Septbr.  Here I joined the Column on the 11th, having accompanied General Augur to the Witchita Agency, bringing with me Little's and Bowen's Companies from the Agency.  I found the Washita bank full, and the 12th was occupied in rafting across the river these two Companies and their train.\n         My plan, approved by the Department Commander, was to move up the Washita to catch any Indians between myself and Colonel Miles' Column, and if not successful in this, to drop down on the North Fort and McClellan Creek, and failing in finding Indian Caps there,  to

Kiowa Mexican of Lone Wolf's band with 3 head of stock, evidently sent in to get information.\n         On the 21st. Septbr. I received information from Lieut. Pratt that he had found Capt. Bristol's camp of Col. Miles' command on the Sweetwater, and that he was out of provisions.\n\nI started on the morning of the 22nd. to take over beef, bacon and flour to Captain Bristol, and sent scouts over to the Washita to inform Col. Miles of my whereabouts.  He kindly met me at Capt. Bristol's camp in the Evening of this day, but I learned nothing to change my plan of moving along the Edge of the Staked Plains to meet Colonel MacKenzie, or find lodge trails.  I endeavored to get supplies from Col. Miles, but he needed everything for his own column and expressed doubts of my getting what I needed even at Camp Supply.\n\n         The column was allowed rest on the 23rd. to wash up and refit.  On the 24th. I marched up and crossed the North Fork, sending Lieut. Pratt and scouts, with a detachment of my Regiment, to search thoroughly the heads of the North Fork of the two branches of McClellan Creek.  During his scout he captured a Cheyenne warrior of some mark, who with the Kiowa before mentioned was ironed and brought with us.  This Cheyenne was one one of a small party from the Cheyenne Agency, carrying news and provisions of coffee and sugar to the hostile camps, which he said he was looking for and had not been\n\nable to find.  These two men are conversant with the country and will be of use in operations on the Staked Plains.

He rejoined me on the 30th. and reported that no signs could be found of the trails of MacKenzie or Buell, on either side of Red River.  Judging that the excessive high water had detained both of them, and my supplies now running short, and the country being wholly without grass, I reluctantly turned my steps towards my base of supplies, my horses forage being exhausted and my men on half rations.  My route was along Buck Creek and Red River towards Wanderer's Creek,\nwhere I presumed supplies may be found for me.\n\n         On the 2nd. October I received word from my scouts that a few Indians had been seen driving stock.  They were pursued by myself with a detachment of troops and scouts, under Lt. Pratt, for 20 miles by the troops and 30 miles by the scouts, but after a rapid chase they got off with the loss of 8 ponies.  The hostile\n\nparty had the advantage of changing on to fresh horses repeatedly.\n\n       This day I detached  my two guides, Stillwell and Kilmartin, with ten Indians to find the camp of supplies on Wanderer's Creek.\n        On October 4th, the trail of a raiding party was found going in the direction of Fort Sill, with apparently thirty head of stock.\n        Lieut. Pratt was detached with about forty scouts to follow the trail. I subsequently I have learned that these were a party of Noconees returning from a raid into Texas, and visited both the Sill and Witchita Agencies, Lt. Pratt lost their trail in the rain storm of the second day.)\n         October 5th, my guides returned, informing me there was no supply camp on Wanderer's Creek, but they had found Capt. Choisey's camp of Col. Buell's command, but he had nothing beyond the supplies of his own Company, and nothing was there for me.  I then moved my Column in the direction of Fort Sill, and it arrived at Herd Creek, where there is a good grazing, on the 10th of October, Here it will refit and recuperate the stock.\n         No trails of lodge poles, or of any large parties were seen in all my march.  The country from Fort Sill to the Staked Plains is swept of Indians.  My own belief is that they are now near the heads of the Red River, and probably still further West, probably the Guadalupe mountains.  There is no grass from Otter Creek to the Staked Plains.  The recent rains have brought up weeds where grass once grew.   I have lost, aft the utmost care with my stock, thirty six horses and twenty two mules, partly from the total absence of grass, and partly from the age and unfitness of the animals.\n         I do not think my stock will be in fit condition to move again, with justice to them, under thirty days.\n         I respectfully suggest cantonments for the Winter at the","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69228,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69228","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b9175eb33acfc70a1d3b487f1f6f1e35.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b9175eb33acfc70a1d3b487f1f6f1e35.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b9175eb33acfc70a1d3b487f1f6f1e35.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b9175eb33acfc70a1d3b487f1f6f1e35.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:05:56+00:00","modified":"2019-08-19T17:03:46+00:00","filename":"b9175eb33acfc70a1d3b487f1f6f1e35.jpg","authentication":"5d5217124cddaffa3556cf61f76a9d2c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00074_o2 copy.jpg","size":627505,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2904,"compression_ratio":0.040015368329762},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["010102+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["010102+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["010102+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b9175eb33acfc70a1d3b487f1f6f1e35.jpg","FileDateTime":1522339425,"FileSize":627505,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2904\"","Height":2904,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2904,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 10:04:11","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3993},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:22 01:01:02","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:22 01:01:02","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":21,"SubSecTimeDigitized":21,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2904,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1033,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1033","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"base of the Staked Plains in suitable locations, in lieu of expedition from Sill and Concha.

General, Dep't. of Texas,\nSir:\n\n         I have the honor to submit the following Answers to the queries contained in your Circular of the 8th inst., addressed to myself and Officers of my Command.\n    1st.,     the water of McClellan Creek and the Sweetwater is good, abundant and permanent.  That of the North Fork is not permanent above the mouth of McClellan Creek.\n    2nd.     there is no timber on any of these streams, fit for anything but firewood.  What there is, is principally Cottonwood, but enough on the three to furnish a post, on one of them, for some years to come.\n    3rd.,     the Sweetwater has the best and most abundant grass.\n    4th.,     I know of no suitable building stone in the vicinity of either and the soil contains too much sand for adobes.\n    5th.,     the character of the country in the vicinity of these streams is about alike, rolling sand hills.\n    6th.,     I saw no evidences of coal in the vicinity of these streams.\n    7th.,     near the head of Sweetwater, timber for fuel can be gotten from that stream, from theWashita and Gageby Creek and from the North Fork and McClellan Creek, but I know of none suitable for building.\n    8th.,     I do not think hay in any amount can be cut on any of these streams, the animals would have to depend upon grazing.\n    9th.,     there are bottoms to these streams and of considerable size on McClellan Creek, but these last overflow.\n                                   I am Sir,\n                                    Very respectfully\n                          (Sgd.)

T. Dec. 10. 1874.\nA. Adjut. Gen'l., Dep't. of Texas,\nSir:\n\n            Referring to your communication, dated Dec.8, 1874, I have the honor to submit the following as my answers to the questions contained therein, based upon personal observation during expeditions to McClellan Creek and the country in that vicinity in 1871 and 1874.:\n\nAnswer No. 1. __ McClellan Creek - the water is permanent, running below the forks, 15 miles from the mouth, even in dry seasons and existing in deep holes fed by springs.  Slightly impregnated with gypsum and other salts of lime, with some sulphur, but not disagreable to the taste.\n\n                      -North Fork - in 1871, after a dry season, no water was found in the North Fork, just below the mouth of McClellan Creek.  In 1874 water was only found in holes, above the mouth of McClellan Creek and this after recent rains.  No reliance can be placed in the permanency of the supply.  The water is impregnated more or less with gypsum.\n                    - Sweetwater Creek - at the longitude of the mouth of McClellan Creek, very little water is to be found in the Sweetwater as it heads at or near this locality.  Farther down, at a point about 25 miles from the mouth of McClellan Creek, there is an abundance of water, perfectly sweet and unfailing in the driest seasons.\n\nAnswer No. 2. --  The timber to be found on each of these streams is of the same character, consisting of cottonwood and hackberry or small size occurring in small clumps or scattered along the course of the river or creek, but not in large quantity.  At the longitude mentions, or in that vicinity, the greatest amount of wood for fuel can be obtained on the Sweetwater, about 25 miles from its mouth, as it is not more than 8 or 10 miles from Gazeby's Creek, where a quantity exists.\nAnswer No. 3 -- The best and most abundant grass is to be found on the Sweetwater.\nAnswer No. 4 --  I same some limestone on the North Fork, but as the whole country is geologically a limestone formation, I have no doubt that stone suitable for building purposes can be found on either the North Fork or Sweetwater.\nAnswer No. 5. --  The country near the North Fork and McClellan Creek is rolling, sandy and covered with shin oak, very little grass being found on the hills.  Near the Sweetwater, a better quality of soil occurs and grass suitable for grazing is found on the high ground.\nAnswer No. 6. --  Did not notice any evidence of coal, excepting an oily substance, resembling petroleum, which was seen on some ponds near McClellan Creek.\nAnswer No. 7. -- The Sweetwater at about longitude 100 degree 20' W. is the most favorably situated, as far as timber is concerned.

Adjut. General, Dep't. of Texas,\nSir,\n\n                  I have the honor to submit the following replies to questions contained in your communication on the 9th inst. respectively:\n\nI.     McClellan Creek always contains water in large holes and is the most of the year a running stream.  The North Fork becomes dry at the point mentioned during the summer.  The Sweetwater has running water at all seasons of the year; but I do not think that permanent water can be found as far West as the point designated.  The water of all of these streams is sweet at the point mentioned.  McClellan Creek has sufficient quantity for military purposes.\nII.                The timber on McClellan Creek is principally Cottonwood with some Hackberry, it is very much scattered.  To the best of my recollection the greatest amount and largest timber is near the Forks.

I cannot speak with certainty about the permanency of the water in the North Fork at the mouth of the McClellan Creek, but judge it to be permanent and owing to the volume poured into it from the Creek just named.  The Sweetwater is in my judgment an \"abiding blessing\" in the sand region contiguous to the streams named, pure and sweet to the taste, as is the McClellan, but a little hard, finding its way to the parent stream in a narrow channel way, with low sedgey banks, fringed with willow mostly with a sprinkling of cottonwood, hackberry and towards the mouth some Elm was seen.  The rapidity of its current gives indication of a constant supply.   It is difficult to judge as to the quantity of water that would be furnished by these streams in a very dry season, as they are -- as all streams in the West are -- fed by the fall rains to an extent

The quantity and quality of greas on McClellan Creek is simply \"nil\".  The ridges lying between the streams names, in many places afforded good grass, but as a rule interspersed with the \"Scrub\" or 'Thin Oak\" as it is euphoncously termed.\nAnswer to 4th Question. --  About six miles East of Sulphur Springs or the forks of McClellan Creek, a large ridge of stone was observed, on the South side of the Creek, near the confluence of a small stream, running in from the Southwest, cannot judge as to its availability for building purposes, but its reddy or reddish appearance to me would indicate one of the necessary qualities i. e. hardness.  In my judgment the soil in the valley of the Sweetwater could be made available for adobie making and that rock formations could be found well up, or West, on the same stream.\nAnswer to 5th Question. --  Either stream is bordered by sand belts, in some places narrow and others extending across from stream to stream.  Rolling prairie is found on the south of McClellan and on the Northside of the North Fork, east of the mouth of Sweetwater.\nAnswer to 6th Question. -- no coal or evidence of it visible, other than the presence of an oily substance observed in the water of some of the small streams, putting into McClellan Creek from the South, notably the one mentioned as debouching into the McClellan near the stone or rock formation, mentioned above, which might possibly be an evidence of the presence of petroleum in the region named.\nAnswer to 7th Question. -- From report the South fork  of McClellan affords some considerable timber, as does likewise a small stream observed as putting into the North Fork, just West of the mouth of McClellan Creek -- from the North no considerable, or rather large body of timber for permanent use was observed on any of the streams named including the Washita West of the 100

bottom lands of considerable extent in the valley of McClellan Creek, near its mouth, no timber visible, except a few straggling cottonwood trees.  The debris of a large overflow was observed in the valley of the Creek, giving evidence of being in greater part submerged during the August and September rains.  The valley of the Sweetwater is quite large and opening out well towards the bluffs' on the Northside, furnishing in many places bottoms of no mean extent for so small a stream, and as noted above, towards its mouth opening out into a broad valley of considerable extent.  As before stated, only a fringe of timber was observed along this stream, but looking West from the point at which our Command left, the valley in the direction of the Washita, a considerable amount of timber was visible and broken country with bluffs jetting down to the Creek.

They both cease to run in dry seasons, but there is permanent water in McClellan Creek in dry seasons, in clear deep pools, doubtless inexhaustible.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69236,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69236","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/0e5ffc04cbe74b7f3905fbe64f9b88b3.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/0e5ffc04cbe74b7f3905fbe64f9b88b3.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/0e5ffc04cbe74b7f3905fbe64f9b88b3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0e5ffc04cbe74b7f3905fbe64f9b88b3.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:06:04+00:00","modified":"2019-08-27T20:08:00+00:00","filename":"0e5ffc04cbe74b7f3905fbe64f9b88b3.jpg","authentication":"6486fafeae4117e33149ae8121f29e92","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00078_o2 copy.jpg","size":685596,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2870,"compression_ratio":0.044237708091367},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["010217+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["010217+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["010217+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0e5ffc04cbe74b7f3905fbe64f9b88b3.jpg","FileDateTime":1522339425,"FileSize":685596,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2870\"","Height":2870,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2870,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 10:04:14","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4422},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:22 01:02:17","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:22 01:02:17","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":47,"SubSecTimeDigitized":47,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2870,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1033,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1033","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"150\n2nd.,     The timber on Sweetwater is all Cottonwood and very sparce and stunted.

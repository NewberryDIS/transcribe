He was married to Lucy Wetmore (1748-1826) daughter of Seth Wetmore. After two years in the ministry, Whittelsey resigned from his church and began a life of commercial activities in the clothing business. During the Revolution he was a purchasing agent for the Continental Army in Connecticut and after the War, through the 1790's, he continued as an Army supplier to the United States 2nd Regiment. Whittelsey achieved some status in the community, serving as Middletown alderman, representative to the Connecticut State Legislature (1809-1811) and Collector of the Port (1797-1801), besides being a deacon of the Congregational Church for twenty-three years. In 1783, he was appointed as administrator of the confiscated properties of James Jauncey (d. 1790) a Loyalist of New York.

Bell's plantation\nDear Father\n\n<pre>    Your kind letter of Dec 26th was received last night accompanied by a joint letter from Mother and Isaac, making the first mail matter which I have received for more than three weeks, owing in a measure I suppose to our communication between here, and Louisville being for a time cut off.  (I also received 4 newspapers, viz 2 Journals, 1 Banner, and 1 Scottish Journal which are very acceptable.   I have not written to you Father more frequently, knowing that your mind would be much occupied by businefs attending your brother's deaths to molest you with what I might write concerning war and army matters, I hope you and mother have received before now, my letters in regard to our late battle before Murfreesboro.   I intend sending you 2 printed, reports one Gen'l Mortin's, and the other Capt Bridges both of the Pioneer Corp to Gen'l Rosecranz which I have read and which give \"Stokes Chicago Bd of Trade Battery\" great credit and certainly not more than they deserve, But Gen'l Rosecranz was right in the battery once or twice every day, and gave us orders directly from his own mouth, and accordingly cannot forget us.\n    Since the battle quite a number of our men have been unwell, I was not fit for duty for 3 days but I am again as sound as a brick, and while writing I am in Jno. Bell's old house waiting upon two or three of our boys, who are rather under the weather.\n     Since coming to Murfreesboro 2 of our men have been discharged for standing disability, and sent home.   Jacob Grosch, (blacksmith) and \n<\/pre>\nF. J. Favor, (the old horsedoctor) 2 others H.W. Hildreth, and Chas. W. Johnson went out looking for horses and returned in a day or two with written paroles, which the Capt not considering genuine ordered them not to notice, but go about their duties as usual.  Next day they ran away from camp, and are now considered as deserters.  So you see the battery is fast loosing in numbers.   Moody from Chicago was in our camp last Sabbath, but he never brings  any encouraging news, He would have had entirely discouraged the battery after our well-fought fight, but we knew he was a blowhard and paid no attention to him.  The Capt said he ought to be kicked out of camp, but we let him go in peace.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":53204,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/53204","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/9a6a54bb772960d6c9e2587c2e404c95.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/9a6a54bb772960d6c9e2587c2e404c95.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/9a6a54bb772960d6c9e2587c2e404c95.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9a6a54bb772960d6c9e2587c2e404c95.jpg"},"added":"2017-12-20T17:30:46+00:00","modified":"2017-12-20T17:35:33+00:00","filename":"9a6a54bb772960d6c9e2587c2e404c95.jpg","authentication":"c7eaf58bfd9c1de663dd94bf186e00ed","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/civilwarletters\/archive\/fullsize\/9f90325af953c431cf40bbf298f73ee0.jpg","size":155809,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":500,"resolution_y":800,"compression_ratio":0.12984083333333},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"Caption-Abstract":["Call Number: Midwest MS Fleming\rBx. 1 F. 19\rAuthor: Fleming, John C., b. 1844 \rTitle: John C.

Since leaving Louisville I have turned Postillion for a number of reasons, one is I never have to walk never have to stand guard and so have all night to sleep and I have 2 horse blankets at night which I find very comfortable along with my own government blanket.  I need not go foraging unless I wish to, and besides all I have the best team in the battery, and I have learned how to take care of them.   I find I did not half take care of our mare at home ( My team is the one which John Nourse used to have, that large team which I often pointed out to you up at camp, belonging to our gun.  Johnny Nourse has another team with  a lighter harness)  The Capt always notices them in particular on review or inspection.

You wanted to know if I had read as you advised me to in Samnel.   I have read some, and intend to more and more as I have an opportunity but when I came from home I only brought a new-testament with me and have accordingly to borry  a Bible when I have time to use it from some of the others.  I will let you know when I have finished it.   My letter of the 9th inst, which I hope you will receive, I promised to give you a rude sketch of the late battle field and for this reason I have written closely to have room for it on the inside.   It will give you but a sent of idea of our position and that of the rebels which may not be disinteresting.   I have finished my  sketch and I think by a little attention and referring to my letter of the 9th you may gain a slight idea of our position.   When I have [illeg] I will endeavor to give you a more thorough sketch.  Additionally ground I have shown you [illeg in the crease] of us was occupied by the rebels. We drove there from next the river on Friday afternoon.  I have not seen Willie  Christian since we came to Murfreesboro,  I saw him though after the battle he was well.   No more at present.

The boys in the battery are in good spirits. they have plenty to eat and hear some good news every day. Johnny Hall and Wm Eakins are well and as it is about bed-time I must quit for the present. My love to all. I remain your loving Son John C.

I did not see Capt Duguid as his company was on the skirmish line that day. I hope you will receive that letter yet. but if you should not, let me know and I will give you another account of our raid and the fight we had about 20 miles south of Atlanta.\nWell Mother we are not in Atlanta yet. but our 34 pd guns keep pounding away night and day. Firing every 2 or 3 minutes, and by this time the town must be pretty well riddled. 2 brigades of our division and 4 of our guns left last Thursday morning at 2 oclock going on a raid down towards Macon, where Stonemans was gobbled. Our section being on duty in line of battle did not have to go. but are here and sent some with the remaining brigade of the division.

Fred Wugert was also badly wounded but is still alive.  John C. Camberg and Howard Phillips were both slightly wounded. \nThe battery also had 6 or 7 horses killed so that you will conclude raiding is a poor businefs.  Shortly after the return of our division from this raid, Sherman's commenced his great flank movement which was followed so soon by the capture of the Atlanta and of course we were off again. We went as far south as Jonesboro and Sherman after thrashing Hood completely twice and having occupied Atlanta and concluded to end the campaign and our army fell back leisurely to Atlanta and our division of cavalry brought up the rear.  A few rebel cavalry had the imprudence of following us back but they were very careful not to stir us up, as Hood evidently has a great deal of reverence our respect for Gen Sherman.  The Army of the Tennessee stops at East point.  The army of the Cumberland at Atlanta and The army of the Ohio at Decatur and the 2nd Division of Cavalry is at Cross Keys about 10 miles from Atlanta where there forage is plenty.

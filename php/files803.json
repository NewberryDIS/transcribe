The wheat in this section has been headed out these two weeks. Gen. Pope's divis. went on board boats at New Madrid during the 12, 13 and 14th of Apr. Our reg. got on board during the 14th and proceeded down the Mississippi about fifty miles but something did not work as expected so after some delay we returned up the Mississippi, up the Ohio and up the Tennessee rivers being on the boats until the 22nd when we landed at Hamburge landing Tennessee two miles below Pitsburge landing. The rivers were all very high especialy the Mississippi and Ohio. There was a vast amount of water in Cairo and the water threatened to wholy submerge that place. Below Cairo there was but few places that any earth could be seen. Island no. 10 remained high above the water and looked savage as ever. Our reg. has moved many times since we have been here and we have had sevral skirmishes. Major Arlington with sevral others of this reg. has been killed and sevral horses killed. The Secessionists don't stand well before the western unionists. I think the rebels will suffer a severe defeat at this place unless they manage to evacuate and that will afford them but a short relief. I suppose you are posted in regard to the vast military opperations taking place here and of our glorious success at other points. We have papers up to the 14th and they cost $.15 per coppy.

We have been so constantly on the move that I have had no opportunity to write. We were at Courtland, Ala. when I received your last letter. On the 24th of Aug. we pulled up stakes and left there and after two days march we camped in the mountains eighteen miles south of Tuscumbia. There was but a part of our Reg. and a part of the 3rd Michigan there. After doing considerable picketing and scouting in that vicinity and having taken some rebels we struck our tents and started for Tuscumbia. We started about ten oclock at night Sept. 5th and arived at Tuscumbia a little before day. The next evening our reg. was placed on guard all around the city while infantry and bagage trains were evacuating the place and going west with all possible dispatch. About midnight, the place having been evacuated sevral hours, we were called off and followed on after the rest and we traveled on double quick until we caught up. Sept. 7th we marched all day and set down at night on buzzard-roost creek near Buzzard-roost station. That night we got a good sleep with the exception of getting up at three o clock in the morning. . That was the morning of the 8th and we had to travel back sevral miles to guard a railroad bridge until some cotton could be hauled off.

But about sun up we were roused up by the reports of firearms and before we could roll up our beds and saddle artilery as well small arms began to play showing that things was rapidly coming to a crisis.

Our reg. immediately passed out formed in line and charged. We drove the rebels over a mile where they were strongly reinforced insomuch that they outflanked us both on the right and left. Co.

A great many rebels fired at us at not more than ten paces distant yet there was not a man in Co. D killed but the Co. lost three men taken prisoners had sevral horses wounded and lost on in the mud.

A partially finished battery of heavy guns in the center of town now opened upon the rebels with terible effect insomuch that they fell back closely folowed and again the fort they had taken opened upon them and slew them with a great slaughter. The rebels also lost a good many of their men taken prisoner in this last movement. It was near noon when the rebels commenced falling back and they never halted in the vicinity but continued to retreat. About one o clock Gen. Grants division began to pour in but they were a little too late the victory had been won. In the evening our reg. went to our camp and for the first time we saw the recruits that had come to fill up our company and again saw our quinine brigade (as we call them) or those that are never able for duty or at least never ready always having some excuse such as a lame horse or a horse with a soar back a boil on their own posterior the tooth-ache or something else. Early on the morning of the [illegible] we left the quinine Brigade and the recruits, as they have no arms or saddles yet and started in persuit of the Butternuts. Our reg. and the 7th Kansas cav. (whith whom we are brigaded) a small force of infantry and two guns went out on the same road that we came in upon, on the night of the 3rd. while a large force folowed right after the rebels. The first night we camped on our old posis. 15 miles west of Corinth, and near Kosouth. During the night Co.s D &amp; K went to Danville near Rienzi to see if we could find any rebels. Oct. 6th we camped on the Hachie and caught a rebel picket force there without fireing a gun. The next day (7th) we advanced cautiously towards Ruesserville expecting to find a large force there","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":52061,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/52061","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/38802802c69e0d3d83702e616c20443f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/38802802c69e0d3d83702e616c20443f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/38802802c69e0d3d83702e616c20443f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/38802802c69e0d3d83702e616c20443f.jpg"},"added":"2017-12-20T15:22:14+00:00","modified":"2019-10-29T16:51:29+00:00","filename":"38802802c69e0d3d83702e616c20443f.jpg","authentication":"c8e481faff6fcf70233d82b9b085d7cc","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/civilwarletters\/archive\/fullsize\/7bd34d9048b75897a7f48c61528b22e4.jpg","size":93004,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":333,"resolution_y":800,"compression_ratio":0.11637137137137},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"38802802c69e0d3d83702e616c20443f.jpg","FileDateTime":1513783334,"FileSize":93004,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"333\" height=\"800\"","Height":800,"Width":333,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":5903,"ImageLength":3077,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"Compression":1,"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Orientation":1,"UndefinedTag:0x0001":"\u0003","XResolution":350,"YResolution":350,"PlanarConfiguration":1,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2013:06:25 11:27:20","Exif_IFD_Pointer":256},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":394,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":2473},"EXIF":{"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2309,"ExifImageLength":5555}}}},"item":{"id":803,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/803","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Charles W.

We drilled with our new recruits, stood picket went forageing etc. On the 29th of Oct. we received marching orders and on the 30th we started, got into Corinth and stood there all day. While there I saw Steven Thurman he was not very well. In the evening we traveled sevral miles out of Corinth and stoped. On the 31st we marched all day. Nov. 1st we reached this place in the evening and camped. We came pretty nigh starving to death on this last march. During the three days we were out I subsisted on three biscuits or rather the first day I had three biscuits and after that nothing. You don't appreciate what a favor it is to have plenty to eat. I don't know of any regiment that gets starved as often as we do. While I write an order comes for us to be ready to march in the morning at day light with five days rations and 250 rounds of cartriges. There is going to be a movement made from Corinth and this place perhaps on Holly-springs. The 103ed Ill. infantry and sevral other regiments arived here to day. The 103 is from Fulton Co.

Jan 17th 1863, Dear Sister, A great many circumstances have combined to keep me from writing for a long time but I improve the present opportunity of writing you a few lines. William and I are both well and neither of have been taken prisoner or hurt. About the first of December Gen. Grants Army moved southward from this place the Cav. taking the lead but I cannot enter into the details of the skirmishes and incidents that transpired on the way. We passed through Holly Springs, Oxford and other towns on to Coffeeville. After we passed Oxford we picked up a great many prisoners some fifteen hundred in number. On the third of Dec. our reg. and the 2nd Iowa had a skirmish with the rebels at Springdale. There was ten rebels wounded and two men of our reg. wounded. The next day Dec. 4th the 2nd Iowa and our reg had another little fight at Watervaley. Companies A, G and D were dismounted and put in the bush the remainder of the reg. and the 2nd Iowa remained mounted. The rebel cav. made a desperate attempt to check us and without halting charged upon us but they charged out again full as fast.

There is a great activity at present in the removal of infantry from this place and other points along this railroad line. They were going all last night and still continue to go. While I write I can hear iron horses running, wheezing and whistling and now and then a train loaded with soldiers rattles off as if the old scratch was after it. The troops are going by rail to Memphis but I don't know where they go from there. It is my opinion that every thing is in readiness at Vicksburge for the grand assault and that all the available troops are being drawn from the various points to participate. Whether there will be any use for cavalry at that place or if there is whether or not this regiment will be called upon I cannot say. This place may be entirely abandoned and it may not. The ways of those in command are inscrutable and past finding out. I have quit makeing conjectures as to the probable termination of the war but we are certainly nearer the end than when we first began. I suppose the copperheads in Illinois would rejoice to hear of our being defeated at Vicksburg but there will be a day of reckoning for those vill traitors. But I am not going to comment upon their evil doings words don't reach their case. Like a passionate man that I once knew from whom the most trivial vexation would call forth a torrent of oaths he was upon a certain time hauling turnips up a steep hill when the end gate came out of his wagon and the turnips tumbled out and rolled to the bottom of the hill.

This company, with others in all about 150 men, has been on one little scout of three days and went pretty nigh around Memphis at the distance of seventeen miles more or less. We crossed some pretty ugly streams, one that we had to ferry, a recent rain having caused the creeks to get on a high. Every thing was quiet in this vicinity, we only saw one rebel during the scout. We saw where four gurrillas had stopped five days loaded with cotton within eight miles of Memphis. They burned the cotton and took the mules with them. Government had nothing to do with the affair... Citizens suffer more from the gurrillas than uncle sam... The prospects are very favorable at present, for a speedy termination of the war.

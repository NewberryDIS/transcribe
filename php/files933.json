He has expressed the wish to make the acquaintance of your family, and so fresh in my memory is your kindness to me while a sojourner in your beautiful city that it is a privilege I should wish every friend of mine to enjoy.  Enroute here I fell in with Genl Terry, and had the pleasure of his company on the Boat from St. Joseph to Omaha.  I cannot begin to tell you how much I was pleased with him, a more elegant gentleman I have never met.

Our table though scantily supplied with Eastern delicacies is always provided with game of some description.  While chasing the Indians the other day we passed Buffalo, Elk, antelope, wolves and a large bear, but were too intent after the nobler game to pay them any attention.

Oct. 11.1864\nDear Friends at Home,\n\n   It is nearly nine.  The children have all retired and I am alone in the sitting room, their schoolbooks, slate and writing materials scattered on the table.  They have to study evenings, as their Arithmetic class comes at eight in the morning, so you see we have to be up betimes, and bestir ourselves to be all through by eight.  Then they do not recite again till after dinner.  So Sissie has a good chance to help me about the work in the morning and John to saw wood or do any thing else that is needed.

Mr. Butler, Mother, Mary and I have all had severe colds this winter and have cured them by sweating.  I have taken a sweat two or three times during the winter.

Last night he slept all night like a little kitten excepting when he awaked to morn.  for you must know he take his meals by night as well as by day. We have been more careful of colds this season on account of the prevailing sickness.  the fear has generally commenced by the appearance of a severe cold, headache, pain in the limbs, etc.  It has not prevailed in the village.  Has been confined to the school mostly.  We are all now in usual health and shall be anxious to hear that you also are quite well of your cold.

I need not tell you, dear sister, how happy it makes us to learn by your letters of your prosperity, good health and so forth.  That you may be prospered and blessed in your studies and that your health may be continued so that in a few months you may again meet with us around the dear, happy fireside at home, is your sister's fervent wish and prayer.  O! Jane, I never realized what a blessing it is to enjoy health, and reason, so much as I have this winter, when we have beheld, with sad yet chastened hearts, the ranges of disease and death among our loved companions.  How grateful we should be when we think that our family has never been called to mourn the loss of one of its member.  The circle yet remain unbroken.  But it will not always be so.  Who will go first?  A veil is drawn over the future  and we cannot tell.\n   Our school has again commenced; over fifty students more than thirty gentlemen and about twenty ladies.  Everything goes on very pleasantly, although our number is small.  Several who were sick in the winter have returned this term.  Miss Wood is our teacher.

Dear Jane, about let your press of engagements dwarf your mind from the great question of Eternity.  You have spoken of the earnestness and faithfulness of your pastor.  Do not let his instructions fall upon your ear unheeded.  O, say sister have much good you could do were you a true christian, and how much will you leave undone if you continue in inpenitence.  My constant pray for you is that you may become a faithful deciple of the Savior.\n\nThank you for your schedule that we may know how you are engaged any hour of the day, though I suppose that lasts no longer than today.

They think Robbie is quite original in his spelling.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":36646,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/36646","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/3d4a0dd417ff7715d29a00de87b31aa3.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/3d4a0dd417ff7715d29a00de87b31aa3.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/3d4a0dd417ff7715d29a00de87b31aa3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3d4a0dd417ff7715d29a00de87b31aa3.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-12T14:13:25+00:00","modified":"2019-07-07T16:00:00+00:00","filename":"3d4a0dd417ff7715d29a00de87b31aa3.jpg","authentication":"700aa0e85f1d438b1b6b2bb2b09115bb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_03_fl_128_015_02_o2.jpg","size":841155,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2302,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.033833502268559},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160304"],"TimeCreated":["050914"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160304"],"TimeCreated":["050914"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160304"],"TimeCreated":["050914"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3d4a0dd417ff7715d29a00de87b31aa3.jpg","FileDateTime":1507817255,"FileSize":841155,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2302\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2302,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"9mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:03:07 14:09:39","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:04 05:09:14","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:04 05:09:14","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":30,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1531,"ExifImageLength":2394,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":158,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/158","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I cannot tell you how much pleased Lissie and Hattie were with Cynthia letters.

Hope some of you will be able to come out and see us this Summer.  If you go to Brooklyn you will be quite a piece on your way, and must not fail to come, if at all possible.  We do not take the Tribune and I have not seen the advertisement to which you refer.  I would not let them make any great experiments on my ear unless I felt very well satisfied that it would be best.  It is better\n\n(along side and top)\nMr. B. came home last Friday.

Since you last heard from us our prospects for the summer are a little changed.  At the close of this term, now about four weeks, there is to be a suspension of the Bib. school until next July or Aug.  This is to give opportunity for removal and for rest.

I had been \nwondering how you were getting along. I was surprised to hear \nby Sarah that you were still in Pittsburg, and could not but \nfeel that you might have remained here a little longer \nif you had wanted to and then I thought again if you did not \nwant to I did not either. Sarah was very glad to see you \nbut felt hurt + disappointed at the coldness + formality \nof a fashionable call, so unlike what she thought was you \ndisposition. She thought you highly dressed, rather dandyfied \nbut upon the whole she rather liked to see too much deep? than \ntoo little, not so with me. I always think the style of \ndress indicative of the mind. Great minds cannot \nstoop or take time to decide upon the color of their kids? or \nthe tie of their cravats. I insisted on it that any formality \nor stiffness you might observe? was only on outside, \nbut my dear boy don't let the world get the ascendency \nover your feelings and affections, be yourself always. \nCherish and indulge your noblest nature, the affections, \nand despite the vain and heartless requirements of the world. \nSarah was not alone in thinking you greatly changed by contact \nwith the world, but I know that is a deep understatement \nthat I hope will one day assert its supremacy and flown \non a strong full stream unruffled by the little pebbles of \nambition or fashion. \nI really hope Julie has a good girl by this time or that the baby \nis better, you did not say anthing about the children or

I tell you now so Julia will know, Jane seems to \nenjoy her return altho' she enjoyed her visit so much, we \nfind her very much improved, she seems so different and \nso happy. I suppose you are all convinced now that I did not \nmagnify the coil? she sufferedI feel safraid? and so very \nthankful, and also appreciated the instrumentality of my darling \nJohnny, and the kindness and filial and sisterly love of his \nlovely wife, much love to her, and a kiss to each dear little one. \nFrom a very devoted and loving Mother, \nthe boys are at a little poorly this

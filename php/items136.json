Educated at the Young Ladies' Domestic Seminary in Clinton, NY, she remained there as a teacher and also principal. She married Reverend J.J. Butler and had a son, John H., and two daughters, Elizabeth (Lizzie) and Hattie. The family lived in New Hampton, New Hampshire, for many years, later settling in Hillsdale, Michigan, where Butler was a professor of theology at Hillsdale College. Their son J.H. Butler was professor of Latin there as well. To improve his poor health, J.J. Butler traveled to Europe in 1867, and his letters home include his observations of Italy and the religious climate there. Hattie married a preacher, Holden Putnam, and settled in Ludington, Michigan where Putnam was pastor of the Congregational Church.","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":41,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/41","name":"Description","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"To transcribe","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}

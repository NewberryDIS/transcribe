But I suppose we shall hear by Jhon before a letter will arrive. - Letitia received 2 letters from Lizzie Saturday, one from Scott, the other from Skanealetes. She and all of us were very, very glad to get them. \nLetitia has got the pen, and I have'nt and must write without it. You will excuse me, I know these lines resemble those you sent from Utica I think. How did you find Lizzie and Sarah and the baby? Had Granky? gained much in flesh? I wish I could see them all.

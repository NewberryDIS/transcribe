I was ironing at the \ntime, and though I gave myself great credit\nfor not leaving my work to answer your note\nimmediately, I must confess that some wrinkles \ndried into the clothes, as every now and then they\nwere left spread out on the table, while I stole \naway to get a fresh peep at your sweet face.\nEach of us girls tried to claim you as a \nnearer relative than the rest by saying \"I believe\nshe looks like me.\" \"No, she don't, she looks like\nme\" etc. but Lizzie, I carried the palm, for\nwhen we showed the likeness to baby, he said it","4b883ac532e7980b90f5c3e5f07b3078.jpg"],[30455,"speak the truth. Quite a number of our friends\nhave said that you resemble Jennie, but\ncousin Alexander had the good sense to remark\nthat you looked some like me. I \nthanked him, and said I could get \nmany to say so, and he replied that you \ncertainly did. A doubtful compliment to yourself I am\nafraid you will think, when you have\nseen my face, but console yourself with \nthe thought that \"resemblance and beauty\nare not always coincident.\"\nIndeed, dear cousin, I thank you very\nmuch for your photograph, and gladly concede\nto your wish and return you mine.\nI also send you one of Eddie's, your father's \nnamesake. Will you not write to him some \ntime, but don't tell him I asked you to, let\nhim think his likeness brought it. He\nleft it, when he was home, for you, so you\nsee it is his gift, not mine.

I was not home when \nMr. Thomas brought them, so I did not \nsee the commotion they made, but they\nwere shown me the very first thing when\nI arrived. We study the features very often, \nand are fast getting acquainted, but dear\nme, I cannot feel satisfied with just seeing\nyour portraits, I want to see and know\nyou all. This world does seem to me\nmost inconveniently large.\nI must tell you what a time I had trying\nto see Rev. J. Thomas Ligerpool?.

How many vacant places will we find it ever we go home! How quickly life passes! Let us live to win heaven!\nWe are having the grip of winter hold of us! tho' no snow or rain since those dreary days before thanksgiving. Yesterday, John had a last unclear calf killed and we have meat a plenty and very nice. Most of it hangs high in the corn crib, we hope not to be obliged to corn much of it as the weather is cold. You probably know that Robbie intends coming here early in Feb. to rend John's farm or to work for him.

Mary helps him so faithfully, but it is a tax on her she does not find a light one. She drives the team of houses to and from town and they are of the pulling kind giving her arms full exercise I think they are better of that since she has tried less tension on her end of the lines!\nThat box came so quickly that we can hardly realize that its journey was no less than those other tantalizing ones! John paid for it and the clothes will more than repay him. My water proof dress will I hope be a treasure by and by, if the unclear don't get it first. We have caught four with a trap in the corner they have gnawed through from the outside. The men have been shelling corn and filling the bags for John to go to the mill after feed. He has it exchanged for meal to save him waiting. It takes quite a little while to weigh the corn then its equivalent in ground corn so that Mary usually utilizes it making a call on Mrs. Hovey?. It was from her that I bought the turkey eggs and she will let us have more next spring so we need not keep turkeys all winter.","c662f0dd92d1d1c60157617e792c6760.jpg"],[30638,"We shall be glad to get the details of how our farm is rented when it is convenient.

Have you made any arrangement to have the roofs cleared in case of heavy snow? Was the water let down in the cistern pump? Is the cellar banked? Have you seen cousin Minnie Roberts since going to Utica? Is she is Omaha now? Is her brother studying medicine? or has he been? If I remember rightly he chose that for his profession before he went to the Academy. I wonder if we shall see Minnie sometime in this western world! What kind of a time had gone in N.Y. Mills? How near do the cars come to 89 Garden St.? You must have enjoyed that floral treat with cousin Mary. I miss the flowers so much. What did you do with our plants at home?

Do you think your health is decidedly improving? Does your heart trouble you as formerly? Does Dr think the palpitation arises from the same cause as your other difficulties? How is your stomach? What a host of questions. You will perhaps say, well there is not one to which I do not wish I had to answer. I expect you will have a nice visit with Jennie and Anna. They left us yesterday intending to be with you tomorrow. Do not visit too hard, but enjoy it as much as you can. Jennie has been quite poorly this vacation, we hoped the trip would do her good, and I know Sarah will be delighted with a visit from Anna. My head is much better than when I last wrote and as Sarah would say, I must mark the hours that shine. I try to, and feel happy today. The house is very still only minestrone home today.

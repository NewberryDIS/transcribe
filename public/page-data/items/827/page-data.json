Last week when we were snowed in by a 9.8 inch snow - the record for the winter, I believe, after that beautiful false spring, I made some headway in final copying and felt encouraged.

But the demon of sciatica swooped down upon me and so I'm merely nursing myself, with \"page 10\" (1895) waiting on my typewriter. I've done the \"spade work\" for 1893 and 1894. There are most interesting items and knotty problems. If I could work steadily every day it would not take long to finish; that, however, is not possible.

In the fall of â95 I returned and took special work to enable me to secure a state certificate. I occasionally read the Hesperian but did not keep any copies. I have a few friends who attended the Uni about the same period that I did.  I shall inquire and if any have a copy , after all these years, I shall tell them of your wish to obtain a copy with the writings of Willa Cather .

I regret to say that I do not have any of these numbers. I have a few late 1895 issues and quite a number of those 1896 and of 1897.\nI do underlined have a copy of the Sombrero underlined, the Junior Annual put out in 1894 by the class of 1895, of which Miss Cather was a member. Miss Cather was one of the editors of this Annual. This particular Annual featured the Quarter Centennial Anniversary Program of the University of Nebraska. James A. Canfield, father of Dorothy Canfield was Chancellor at that time. On pages 224-231 of this publication there appears a first prize story. âThe Fear That Walks By Noondayâ all underlined written by Willa Cather and Dorothy Canfield, evidently a joint product of these two young writers. No doubt your client has used this publication. I would not care to part with this book. I prize it very, very, highly. I knew many of its contributors. I first went to the University of Nebraska as a law student in 1892 but switched over to the Liberal Arts College and took several years","e84fb3bc3c2dddce8b4377133f262567.jpg"],[53990,"2\nwork in the social sciences.

I stricken- quite frequently sometimes saw overwriting say Dorothy Canfield accompanying her father to the campus in the Early forenoon. She wore her hair (for a time) long and unbraided and looked like quite a young girl. I am willing to loan your client my copy of this âSombreroâunderlined but not sell it.

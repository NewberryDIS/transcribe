Carroll & yourself at the agency one week from that time, the 29th of this month, for the purpose of holding a conference on the subject of your mission. The people did not deem it expedient for them to take any step on the suggestion, because there was a constituted authority duly authorized by the whole Cherokee people to represent their interests and to attend to the public affairs of the nation;- and, I regret to say, that the shortness of the time you fined upon, made it impossible for the chiefs & the representatives of the Cherokee people to meet you: Carroll at the time & place you suggested. The great fatigue they had undergone in attending  the election so remotely from the place of holding the general council of the nation, and the agency House, - and the consequent privation which they experienced from the very unexpected & seemingly unnecessary delay in bringing the election to a close, by their exposure to rains, hunger, & in circumstances in connection with the fact that their crops of corn having not, as yet, been generally laid by,- which, when duly considered by the commissions, I cannot doubt will be properly appreciated. Permit me to assure, sir, that it would have given the chiefs and the representatives of the Cherokee people pleasure, had it been practicable for them to have met and taken their old friend & brother soldier, His excellency gov. Carroll,  by the right hand of friendship.- But, their peculiar situation as states, and the time & place suggested by you, would not allow them to do so. I regret this more especially, as the very reasonable request which I had made this you to Major Currey on the 7th instant, to change the place which he had designated for holding the election, so as to hold it either at Red Clay or at the Agency,- had not been complied with; because the convenience of the commissioners as well as the chiefs","14d0fda5bc415a21c1f3140097826309.jpg"],[71315,"chiefs & people of this nation, would all have been consulted & accommodated.\nI beg leave to remark in candor frankness, without intending any disrespect, that, from what had passed between us at the interview we had at the agency on your first arrival there, and from what has since taken place, and the course pursued, I feel somewhat disappointed and as if I had reasons to apprehend that I have been deceived regarding the frank, liberal & impartial step which I had been inclined to believe you would take in hinging before the nation the business entrusted to your Commission by the United States government. On the part of the chiefs & Representatives of the nation, in the discharge of their duties towards their people either individually or collectively, I do assure you that they know no parties; and, for myself, I will again repeat, that so far as the rights of individuals are concerned, and as depends upon my public duty, I have even respected and held them sacred:- Whether they be my private or political enemy, is a matter of no consideration: [It] never has and I trust never shall, turn the scales of justice in my hands against any of my fellow countrymen.\nI will add, in conclusion, that I have been requested by the chiefs, Representatives & people of this nation, to communicate, for the information of the Commissioners of the United States' government that their general council will be convened at Red Clay on the second Monday of October next, the 12th day of that month, and at which Council they will be prepared to hear & act definitively upon such business as the United State Commissioners may submit for the consideration of the nation, under their instructions from the Preside of the United States. \nI am, Sir, \nvery respectfully\nYour illegible\nJ.

The Commissioners are determined not to deceive you or the Cherokees, and, if possible, will not suffer themselves to be deceived by them.

You request me to inform you by the Bearer whether it is my determination & that of the Principal men, not to meet the commissioners at the place & time according to their request & appointment. There has been no request, or previous notice of any appointment made by the commissioners for us to meet them at the agency, until the verbal suggestion was made by Mr Schermerhorn, as has been stated. In my letters of the 24th inst. to gov: Carroll & to Mr. Schermerhorn, have fully stated the causes which made it impossible for us to have attended at the agency on yesterday, and it was with the utmost sincerity that I assured Mr Schermerhorn that it would have given the chiefs & the representatives of the Cherokee people pleasure, had it been practicable for them to have met and taken their old friend & brother soldier his Excellency gov. Carroll by the right hand of friendship. And I beg leave now to state distinctly in reply to your interrogation that I have not come to the determination not to meet the commissioners at the agency; but on the contrary, I am disposed cheerfully to meet them at any proper time when circumstances will allow, after being duly notified by them jointly not do so; and I am fully persuaded such also are the feelings of the other principal men on the subject; but of impossibilities I have no control. \nAs to the enquiry you have though proper on this occasion to make of me concerning the letter addressed by the Cherokee Delegation to the Hon: Secretary of war on the \n28th of","e49fbdda8d473a7ebd87947b171455d7.jpg"],[71319,"28th of July 1835, They have to refer you to their entire correspondence with the war of Executive Department on the subject, together with their memorials to congress.

I am happy to be informed that you are determined not to deceive the Cherokees nor myself, for I assure you that there is no inclination on my part to deceive you. And I should be extremely gratified were you to be more cautious against believing every evil report you may hear against myself & other public men of the nation calculated to prejudice or mislead your minds against our true disposition. The allusion you have made to speeches which I addressed to the people last week on our separation, advising them not to meet the commissioners at this time, compels me to express this solicitude; for I do assure you that I did not so advise them, but, on the contrary, when I found that the people had considered it to be the impossible & inexpedient for them to attend, I consulted the most prominent men in authority as to their own attendant & they all declared it to be impossible for them to do so; in consequence of which I have been authorized to address you the letters of the 24th inst.--\nIn conclusion, I beg leave to say that I trust whenever the United States commissioners may think proper to bring forward the business entrusted to their change by the President of the United States, in a formal way, before the Cherokee nation in general council, for their consideration & determination, that all due respect will be shown to the Commissioners in their deliberation and action upon the same.- as to any differences of opinion among illegible, I sincerely desire that they may be harmonized. and I cannot but think, if those entertaining adverse opinions from my own, in the great mass of the nation, were to reciprocate the same.","34468094a1055838ba2f44e2edf17816.jpg"],[71320,"same feeling, with the view of promoting the welfare of the whole nation,- that, by conferring with each other in a proper manner at our own mutual convenience, all would soon unite in brotherly friendship & harmony.\nI am, gentlemen, very respectfully\nyour illegible : noble: illegible\nJRoss Principal Chief of the\nCherokee Nation.","c28da060503d9b72672334956c277ed5.jpg"],[71321,"in consequence of the unsent request of those connected with the United States government & others, as frequently expressed to Mr Ross in letter & conversation, he was induced to convince them that he had no wish whatever to avoid a meeting with the illegible Ridge or to deny those gentlemen an opportunity for uniting with him for the common good.

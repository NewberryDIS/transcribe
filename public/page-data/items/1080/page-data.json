Davis,\nPresent,\nGeneral:\n1. You have been appointed commander of the Military District of Alaska, which included all the Russian-American territory ceded to the United States by the treaty of March 30th, 1867. You will, therefore, assume command of the two companies designated, in Special Orders, No. 141, current series, from the Head Quarters, for the garrison of Sitka, as soon as the same are ready to embark on the transport chartered for that purpose.\n2. In accordance with instructions from the General-in-Chief of the Army, the Military District of Alaska will, until further orders, be attached to the Department of California. You will, therefore, report directly to the Head Quarters of that Department, at San Francisco, California.\n3. Should you reach Sitka before the arrival of the commissioners appointed to transfer and receive formal possession under the provisions of the Treaty, you will retain your command on the transport until such formal transfer is made. If, however, the commissioner on the part of the United States should request you to take part in the formal proceedings of the transfer, you will do so, wither personally, or with your command. If, by any accident, the vessel carrying the commissioners should be unduly delayed, you will arrange with the Russian authorities for landing you troops, and putting them into winter-quarters, prior to any formal transfer--this being provided for in the Treaty.","4f01f2e654981ff5ff808b0759ca9da9.jpg"],[73069,"4. The unexpected delay in the arrival of the commissioners, and the advance of the Season, render it impossible to Establish the other posts ordered for your District. Other troops, however, will be sent to you as Early as practicable in the spring. In the meantime, you will inquire into, and report upon the more prominent points in the District--their relative importance in regard to trade, to the probable settlement of the country, influence upon the Indians unclear. Among the places which have been suggested for military posts, are Portland Canal, opposite Fort Simpson; the mouth of Stakine River; Port Mulgrave in Berring's Bay; Chugachmuik Gulf in Cook's Inlet; St. Paul, Kodiak Island; Captatin's Harbor, unclear Island; Fort Alexander, Bristol Bay; Fort Michael, unclear Sound; and some point or points on the Youkon River. As not more than four additional companies  can be sent to you command next year, it is not proposed that you occupy all these points, but you will report upon their relative advantages and the means necessart for occupying those which you may select.\n5. Prepared materials for officers quarters, barracks, hospital, store-houses, unclear. For two companies, will be sent with your command to Sitka. It is presumed that, at least, some public buildings there will be transferred to you for the accomodation of your troops. You will, therefore, use only so much of these prepared materials as you may find absolutely necessary, reserving the remainder for the other posts which are to be Established next spring.\n6. Every possible precaution must be taken by your command at Sitke against fire. You will appreciate the importance of this when you reflect upon the probable condition of your command, should its provisions and stores be destroyed by fire during the coming winter. A fire-engine, with proper apparatus, will be furnished by the Quartermaster's Department; and you will see that your men are properly instructed","431c15c03d8c2625cd1a8ffbe845d478.jpg"],[73070,"and Exercised in its use, and that a sufficient supply of water is always on hand.\n\n7. You will also give particular attention to the sanitary condition of your command and (Blank spot) of the post of Sitka. As the supply of fresh meat and vegetables will, at least for the next winter, be limited, the deficiency must be made up with fresh fish, game and antiscorbuties. This subject will demand especial attention. \n\n8. Immediately after the exchangeof the flags, and the formal transfer of the ceded territory, you will direct the District Quartermaster and acting Commissary to take possession of all public lots and squared, vacant lands, and all public buildings, barracks and Edificed, and all public property in Sitka, ceded bythe treaty and transferred to the United States. But the Russian officers and troops, who now occupy the same, and who may wish to continue such occupation temporarily, will not be required to vaccate them, until such a time as may be reasonably and conveniently practicable. \n9. You will also designate some officer to take possession of thefortifications, and their armaments, ordnance-stores, of (?) in Sitka, ceded by the treaty, and transferred to the United States; and also of all government archives, papers and documents relating to the ceded territory and dominion, which may exist in that place; and the same will be carefully preserved, in order that copies may hereafter be furnished to the Russian Government in accordance with treaty stipulations. \n10. You will also, at the proper time, designate officers to take possession of the fortifications, barracks, public lots, vacant lands, public buildings, ordnance stores, archives, papers, documents, and other public property transferred to the United States, at the Several Military Posts, towns, villages and settlements in the ceded territory. Proper inventories and returns will be made of all public property so received.","69a6b9887acdae773628863dfd5b97e7.jpg"]],"transcount":4,"percentTranscribed":3,"date":[1867,1871],"category":"Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

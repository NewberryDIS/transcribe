NEW YORK\nFebruary 20th, 1907.\nDear madam: -\nIt may be that you are already a reader of PUTNAM'S MONTHLY, in which case this letter, with its accompanying specimen copy of the magazine, is an unnecessary introduction. Having found, however, that club-women in general are interested in our new magazine, (many inquiries concerning the subscription price, etc. having been received), we now wish to direct the attention of all club women to PUTNAM'S and to offer a very attractive premium.\nWe feel that the interest which PUTNAM'S has created in the intellectually alert and cultivated circles of women's clubs is one of the highest compliments that has been paid to the magazine. Because it is a new periodical which follows the literary and artistic movements of the time, and attends also to the progress of affairs the world over, and because it presents matters in attractive and finished literary form, we feel sure of its appeal to America club-women, and wish to enlist for it their interest and approval.\nYou should, by this time, have the specimen copy of the magazine, and we are confident it will plead its own cause well. If you are an earnest club-worker you will find that the well written and well balanced articles on the large interests of the day, as well as the book reviews and other features, will be of great service to you in the preparation of papers, and in other ways.","a62b71ac60e9547da522295b051f128e.jpg"],[31578,"(2)\nThere is also in the essays and the fiction much to amuse and instruct, and whether you use it for the specific purposes indicated above or not you may rest assured that it will carry to you each month a breath of fresh and charming literature--the work of some of the brightest minds and most graceful pens of the day.\nDesirous of making its first appearance in your home as graciously as possible, PUTNAM'S MONTHLY will bring with it, if it receives an invitation from you, as gift for your acceptance--any one of the popular novels of the day which may be selected. We shall be glad to send you the novel of your choice, and with it the magazine for a year, if you will write the title of the story you select on the last page of the circular and send it to us with $3., the cost of a year's subscription to PUTNAM'S MONTHLY.\nTrusting that the advantageous suggestion we are making may excuse us for trespassing upon your time, we are,\nYours truly,\nPUTNAM'S MONTHLY.\nIf you are not already a subscriber to THE BOOKMAN, we can offer you both PUTNAM'S and THE BOOKMAN at the special price of $3.50.

It is designed to promote the interests of our soldiers and sailors, their families, and those dependent on them for support. It is also intended as an advocate of the claims of our Aid Societies, and kindred associations for the benefit of the Army and Navy. An examination of the paper will show not only its purposes, but the long list of eminent writers who contribute to its columns.\nThe paper is universally welcomed wherever it is received, and there is a constant demand for supplies of copies for distribution among our brave men. In order to furnish these papers to the Army and Navy, contributions are necessary from the friends of the cause.\nYour attention is called to the Letters from Chaplains, and from the army, showing how much it is desired.\nIf each Aid Society in the country would subscribe $10 for twenty copies, the Army and Navy could be liberally supplied. \nThe members of the Aid Societies could also contribute largely to its success by obtaining subscribers for the paper.\nThe MAY number will contain a beautiful and stirring original tale, entitled\n\"MOSES CRANT'S REPENTANCE,\"\nwritten in behalf of Soldiers' Aid Societies. I will send one hundred copies of the May number, containing this tale, to the address of any Aid Society, prepaid, on receipt of four dollars ; two hundred for eight dollars. Please send orders for this number at the earliest possible day.\nAlthough the war is apparently at an end, there will remain a great and responsible work to be done for the coming year ; and our efforts cannot be too earnest or devoted on behalf of the cause. The destruction of the military power of the Confederacy will throw upon our hands a vast work of love and Christian duty in the South.

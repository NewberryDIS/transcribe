The new form resembles that of a snow-plough, & it must act by partially lifting what it comes in contact with, & then throwing it off to the right or left, as it may happen.  This cow-plough, though evidently superior to any contrivance for picking up or catching the cow, does not always do it's work.  Not far from the town of Jackson, we came up with one of these poor animals that happened to be lying on the rails.  On this occasion the plough went over it, & so did the first two or three carriages; til at last the unhappy brute got fast fixed among the springs & wheels of the car I was in.  The train was stopped & the cow taken out, which though horribly mangled, proved to be still alive.  The conductor called out for the loan of a pistol to enable him to put it out of its misery.  In an instant, almost from every window on that side the train a hand was extended offering the desired instrument.  On my making some observation on the number of pistols that were forthcoming ready loaded, at a moment's notice, the gentleman seated next to me replied, \"that it was quite possible that I was the only man unarmed in the train.That formerly in that part of the country most people carried revolvers, but that now, from apprehension of the Blacks, in consequence of the frequent robberies committed by them, no one ever thought of moving without his six-shooter.\"","99641afde7e338adc0c905f4a7904109.jpg"],[59020,"/ Simpson                                                                                 184\nMemphis is on a bluff of the Mississippi.

I always found this room [filled] upon\nhis library & study, with a fire in winter blazing on the hearth,\n& the minister himself seated at the table at work. This arrange-\nment has great advantages both for the Clergyman & for his Parish-\niner(?when). He can study & prepare for his pulpit without any in-\nterruption from his children, or from the ever recurring little in-\ncidents of domestic affairs, to which, had he been in his own house,\nhe wd have been expected to give some attention; & his Parishioners\nare more likely to call upon him in this room, knowing that he is in there\nfor the very purpose of seeing them, & that they should not be disturbing\nanyone by their visit.\nHaving been requested to call on a Clergyman of the place, I foung\nhim in -his- such a room as I have just been describing -annexed to his Church-, in company with another Clergy-\nman of the neighborhood. Of course the conversation turned on Church\naffairs. They told me that there were five Episcopal Churches in the\ncity, that the Episcopal Church was not so active in the States of \nMississippi & Louisiana as elsewhere in the Union. That the Church of\nRome was, in that part of the Country, looking very far a-head, & buy-\ning large tracts of land, & founding educational establishments; that \nthe German and Irish did not leave its communion. That Church\npartisanship was a strong feeling in America. to take for instance our","c0662029de4b8c0d02a986910eb55375.jpg"],[59025,"189\nour Church, there were everywhere men who were not members\nthat is Communicants, but yet considered themselves as belonging to the\nEpiscopal Church, who would fight for every stich in the [sarplice] &\nevery letter in the Prayer-book. And that it was so in all the other\nChurches. Much interest, they said, was taken in the ritualistic\nquestion, because it was becoming generally felt that our Service is\ndeficient in appeals to the senses; & that it wanted variety & anima-\ntion. That in the American Church though there is no Canon forbidding ex-\ntempore Preaching, there is one which imposes on the Clergyman the\nnecessity of writing every sermon he preaches. The object of this Canon\nis to enable the Bishop ------------------ of any statements in\nthe sermon with which the congregation may have been dissatisfied.\nThis was thought necessary in consequence of the sensitivity of some \ncongregations, & the tendency in all American Churches to lapse\ninto some \"ism\" or \"ology.\" They told me that in some of the\nnascent States, as for instance in Idaho, the Church was stronger\nthan any other religious body. In this Territory, (I believe it is still in that\nembryonic condition,) there is not a town or college without an Episco-\npal Church. This has been brought about by sending out Missionary\nBishops to plant the Church in these new Territories. The Missionary\nBishop of Idaho, Dr. Clarkson, is one of the most active & accepted of this\nnew order. As this plan has succeeded so well, it is much to be\nreprelled that it was not albemwhed long ago.","e115dbed5de5135c8a8af281e2339580.jpg"],[59026,"Strick 190 \nAmericans are great travellers.  It almost appears as if there was something in the air of America which makes me think lightly of distances however great.  I heard a Lady at Washington talking of starting in a few days for California - a journey of more than five thousand miles - as if it involved no more than a journey from London to Edinburgh.  I met another Lady at a dinner table at? New Orleans who had only that day arrived from New York, a distance of nearly fifteen hundred miles; & I entered Denver with two Ladies who had been traveling continuously for about two thousand miles each; One from some New England town, & the other from New York.  But I was never made so sensible of an Americans disregard of distance, & of the slightness? of the provocation needed for inducing him to undertake a journey, as I was by an invitation I received from a gentleman to accompany him one hundred & fifty miles out, and of course as many back nerely to hear a Preacher he thought well of, & who he understood wd be only at that distance from Memphis on Sunday.  Now this gentleman was a Lawyer who had come all this distance from Detroit to Memphis on the previous day, on some matter of business, & wd have to start on his return to Monday evening; & this was the way in which he spent the Sunday that intervened between two such long journeys, adding three hundred miles to what anyone but an American wd have thought was already a great deal too much travelling.","d068ea9d6303f3fbe56e6035d370bf99.jpg"],[59027,"191 \nIt is a commonly received opinion, though perhaps more largely entertained by authors than by their readers, that the ever increasing luxury of the present day has do much to weaken the warlike virtures. This opinion I believe is exactly the opposite of the truth; & is merely the echo of the opinion of those writers of Ancient unclear, who made & bequeathed to us a thoroughly mistaken diagnosis of the diseases, & symptoms of the body politic of their own decaying Empire.  Our own late wars. but above everything of the kind in modern or ancient times, the late great American war, show how entirely false is their opinion.

The history of the Seventh New York Volunteers, a regiment of Gentlemen who went out, at the beginning of the war, of their own free will, & went through the whole of it with all its hardships, suffereings, & deadliness, wd alone disprove their opinion.  The hundreds of thousands of men who in the North left their counting houses, their farms, & their drawing rooms to risk health, & limb, & life for an unclear, are just so many hundreds of thousands of arguments against it.  And in some respects the argument from the South is still stronger, for these a still larger proportion of the people went to greater hardships, more cruel wants, &","41f5d84616994fdcde8567e63e560690.jpg"],[59028,"192 \nsufferings, & to a deadlier warfare, inasmuch as the same regiments have more frequently met? the enemy.  In every family I visited in the South I heard tales of suffering & of heroism.  I will only repeat one because it shows what a Lady even can do & bear in these luxurious times.  A Mrs Read, while assisting her husband at the Seige of Vicksburg, had her right arm so shattered by a shell, that immediate amputation was necessary.  It was during the night, but she wd not have anyone called off from other work to do for her what she was still capable of doing for herself; she therefore held with her left hand the lamp which lighted the surgeon to amputate her shattered right arm.","57bfa7ab05a13c6246d06870d75130c5.jpg"],[59029,"193  \nI arrived at Cairo by steamer at three oclock? in the morning.  It was a dark & unclear winter night.  The rain was falling heavily.  At the landing place there was not a light, not a conveyance, not a porter, not a negro even to direct us the way to the Hotel.  Self help was the only kind of help any of the passengers got that night.  As I scrambled up the slippery Levee, & then waded throught the mud to the Hotel, distant about a quarter of a mile, I congratulated myself on my having sent on all my heavy luggage in advance, so that I had nothing with me but a hat-box, & a hand-bag.  but these impediments were more than enough for the occasion.  As I struggled on I thought that if the Author of Martin Chuzzlewit, who was then giving readings in America, unclear revisit his Eden under such circumstances, he wd not feel dissatisfied with the kind of immortality he had conferred upon it.\nThe stream of Passengers at last reached the Hotel.  There was no want of light here.  This had been our beacon, & we felt that we had made the harbour.  It was a large red brick building, with a large Hall, & a large stove, red-hot, in the midst of it.  I went straight to the Clerks counter, & entered my name in the folio guests-book.  I was among the first to do this, that I might secure a good room.  No sooner, however, had I gone through this preliminary than the manager turned to me, & announced, that the house cd not? allow me a room to myself that night, but that I must take one jointly with the gentleman who had registered his name before me.  I","539433ac09b02606fd4f697bc521371a.jpg"],[59030,"194  \nhardly took in the speaker's meaning, for this was the first occasion in my life when the idea of unclear a bed-room with another man had been suggested to me.  I suppose I was so taken by surprise that I remained silent when I ought to have spoken, for I was next addressed by the Gentleman himself with whom it was proposed I sh share the bed-room.  \"Well, Sir,\" he said,\" what do you intend to do?  It is now past three; & if you don't accept this gentleman's offer, you will have to go out again into the Street.\"  Having said this he took the key from the Clerk & turning to an attendant, told him to show the way to the room.  I rather followed than accompanied him, thinking over, as I went along what I had read of Cairo, when, fifteen or twenty years ago, it was a nest of rowdies, rovvers, gamblers, & cut-throats, floating upon a fever-and-ague-haunted swamp.  I had been somewhat reassured by the appearance& bearing of my companion.  He was a clean-limbed, & remarkably handsome man apparently turned of forty.  His moustache & beard were trimmed in the French style, & his bearing was frank & soldierly.  On the other side, however, I observed that he had no luggage whatever.  At last the door was reached & opened.  The attendant entered to light the gas.  While he was doing this my companion crossed the room.  In doing this he took off his coat, & kidked off his boots, & walked \"unclear\" into bed.  This was doen quietly & deliverately, but in less time than it took to light the gas.  I felt that I was becoming uncertain as to the reality of things.  Was I at Drury Lane, looking in at the transformation of a Pantomime?  Or was I dreaming that I was at Cairo?","49c4e4cf7363193cb7881a6f2ca955d5.jpg"],[59031,"195\nEvans?\nAs the balance of probability did not appear to be in favour of either of these suppositions, I took off my boots, & placed them on the outside of the door.  As I closed the door a voice came to me from the bed at the further side of the room.  It's tone was manly & friendly - \"Sir,\" it said, \"if that is the only pair of boots you have with you\" (it was so; for I had sent my luggage on to St. Louis) I wd advise you to keep them inside\"the room, & have them cleaned on your feet in the morning.  The last time I \"was here I put mine outside the door, & never saw them again; & so \"Ihad to go barefooted till I cd get another pair.\"  I thanked the speaker for his advice, & acted upon it.  My next care was to provide for the safety of my watch & packet-book which contained three hundred dollars in greenbacks.  This I did by putting them into the pocket where I had my handkerchief, which I then took out of my pocket, as if there was nothing in it (but the watch & pocket-book were in it) & placed it under my pillow.  I have no doubt but that my companion saw through what I was doing, for he now addressed me a second time.  \"Before you go to sleep, I suppose you wd like to know who is in the room with you; & yet I hardly know how to describe myself.  For the last four or five years I have been on this side the Mountains.  For the fifteen years before that I had been in California; & I began life in the old States as a Lawyer.  In the early days of California, I went out as one of a Company for digging & mining.  There were seven of us, & five of the seven were Lawyers.  I came over the Mountains to help the North in putting down the rebellion.  I made a great","7833e68b64b9f743d2729a7946ccf176.jpg"],[59032,"196\n\"heap of money in California, & I have lost a great heap in bad speculations, \"since I have been over here.  But I have got a scheme on its legs by which I \"hope to make again as much as I have lost.  That, Sir, is what I am - & I \"wish you good night.  My name is...\"  I could not catch the word, but I afterward ascertained it, & found that my first be-room companion added modesty to his other merits, & had not told me how great a man he was in his own State.\nIt happened the next day that no train started for the North till half past four in the afternoon; & as the rain of the previous night had turned to heavy unclear sleet, I congratulated myself on the accident, although it appeared so disagreeable at the time, to which I was indebted for the acquaintance of the Californian.  He had known California, he said, from the first influx of gold-hunters.  The rogues & deperadoes of all that part of the world were collected there; but there was some good stuff that came in at the same time.  Society wd have been completely turned upsdie down, & no decent man cd have remained in the place, if it had not been for Lynch Law, & the unclear of the pistol.  These two things wet everything quite right in five years; in a way in which no other kind of law, supported by all the Churches & all the teachers in the world, could have done it in fifty years.  And now the State is as orderly a community as there is on the face of the Earth.  After the roughness of many years of Californian life, in the early days of the State, he found the hardships of the late war mere bagatelles.  The war seemed to him only like an exciting pastime.","b0725ada2e07d899a3ccf9dc44066751.jpg"],[59033,"M. 161. ch. x. F.

(the Ohio itself not far above this point is joined by more large streams) it became a very important military station.  But it was necessary to create a site for a town, for the locality itself supplied nothing of the kind.  This was done by raising a levee, forty feet high, & then, behind this, making streets in the form of embankments at right angles to the levee, there streets again being intersected by other embankments parallel to the levee.  The whole space that was reclaimed was thus divided by these embankments into hollow squares, each of which is intended for a block of buildings.  At present very few of these blocks have been raised, but the streets, that is the embankments, with in some instances, planked unclear at their sides, are finished.  If the water sd ever rise up through the ground, or the storm-wakes flow into the cellars & underground parts of the houses, it will be necessary to pump it out, for there can be no drainage in such a place.  So in America, where no difficulties are recognized, are towns built in Swamps.\nOne cannot help speculating on what will be the amount of inducement required for getting people to try to live, & carry on business at this city in the Swamp, for the fact that the traffic of the valleys of the Ohio & Mississippi join, & diverge here will ensure its becoming rich & populous.

This is an instance of what is called in American railway phraseology \"making bad connexions.\"  The Gentleman who registered after me at the chief Hotel at Odin happened to be my Californian acquaintance.  Having entered his name, he said to the manager, pointing to me. \"This Gentleman & I wish to have the same bed-room.\"  This was meant as a compliment, & I did not now feel as disinclinedto the proposal, particularly as it came from him, as I had been a few nights before.  The Clerk, however, told him that the House was full, & that I was the last person he cd accommodate.  I was upon this shown to my bed room, which turned out to be only the fourth part of a very small apartment, containing four beds, three of which were already tenanted.  My English inexperience & prejudices were still too strong for this, so I sallied out in search of another Hotel.  During this search I had time to reflect that there is not much more harm in spending the night in a room with three others, than in spending the day in a railway car with thirty or forty others.

St. Louis, regarded as a considerable place, is ten or fifteen years older than Chicago.  The monied men therefore at St Louis are getting onto years, & so have become cautious, & indisposed to try new investments.  The Chicago men are still young, & the enterprise of youth in them is not yet exhausted; & so they are still ready to entertain, & even to accept, new ideas; & a proposal, however grand, or novel, or costly it maybe, is not on these accounts appalling to them.

I mention this because it may be interesting to hear what were one's impressions of the man who conceived & executed one of the boldest & most arduous military achievements of modern times - that of marching his army down through the heart of the Southern States to Charleston & Savannah.  He is a tall thin man, without an ounce of flesh to share.

The letters of introduction he supplied me with he wrote with his own hand.

This seems to us a low view to take of education, & of an university.  But it is what is first wanted in a new country, where every man has to work for his bread, & everything has to be done.  Higher culture is not for the existing but for future generations.  So think the people who manage this Institution.  And so think the people for whose benefit the Institution has been established, except that they have little or no idea at all as yet of the \"higher Culture\".  They are beginning to be intolerant ever? of the time & money spent in teaching Law & Medicine; & of the position assigned to Lawyers & Physicians.  It was in this spirit that a gentleman said to me, on the Prairie between Chicago & Omaha, \"What we want, Sir, in this great country is fewer graduates \"of Law & Medicine, & more graduates of the Machine shop, & Agri-\"cultural college.\"","746160b2f9bde5b5412cbc123fdba463.jpg"],[59042,"206\nThis Washington University has had 800,000 dollars presented & bequeathed to it by Citizens of St Louis in the last eleven years; and as the war & the collapse that followed the war cover more than half of this period, the sum appears very considerable.

He rode all the way.  At that time the country was so little settled that he wd ride by unclear a whole day without seeing a log-hut, or a human being.  He brought with him to St Louis the ideas & the traditions of New England.  His son had, following the example of his Father, moved on Westward.  He had crossed the Mountains & settled in Oregon on the Pacific Coast.  His son had been brought up at St Louis in the ideas & unclear unclear of New England & had taken them with him.  In this way it is that this New England element which is a distinct character, is kept up & propagated throughout the whole West.  Other immigrants bring nothing of so tough & durable? a nature with them; & thus it is that New Englandism is leavening the whole loaf? lump?.","e0f4a8304bd7926b4c7d160b4aa3bcdd.jpg"],[59043,"unclear  207\nIn the West one is frequently confronted by the questions, What will be the effect on the Americans of the Future of the vast hordes of Germans which yearly invade & settle in the country?  Whole districts are occupied by them, beginning in Pennsylvania, to the exclusion of the English language.  In the Western towns you will see street after street in which half, or more than half, the names are German.  They have their own Hotels, their own newspapers, their own theatres. It seems a greater invasion than that of the Roman Empire by their Fathers.  That overthrew the Empire, & for a time disorganized society, however it did not extend the language of the Fatherland into Italy, Spain, or France.  But here is a continuous stream of between 200,000 & 300,000 every year, coming, not with sword & torch, to slay & to burn, or to perish themselves, but with the ax & the plough, to clear away the forest, & to cultivate the soil.  Every one that comes is taken up into that entity which will be the America of the Future.  What then will be the effect?  Many Americans fear that it will not be good.  \"Because,\" say they, \"the Germans are deficient in spirituality\".  That is the word they use.  \"They have no religious \"devotion: this element appears to have been left out of their com\"position.\"\nI am disposed to think that they will have very little power to modify the future character of the nation.  First; because they are all learning,","594d070ba597df217076329b9ca7ff2c.jpg"],[59044,"208\n& must all learn the English language, which cannot but become their mother tongue.  This being the case, they must imbibe the ideas current in America in that language; & so German ideas will fade away, & die out of their minds.\nAnother reason I have for my opinion is that the conflict is between Germanism & New Englandism; & it is carried on upon what may be regarded as the soil of New England.  But New Englandism is a far tougher plant, & one of far more vigorous growth than Germanism, especially when transplanted to another world, very unlike that of the Rhine & of the Danube.  For these reasons I believe that the German invasion will be aborted & lost in America.  It will not Germanize the Americans, but will itself be Americanized.\nThis applies to ideas not to temperament, which is a matter of blood & nerves, & it is possible that the highly excitable American termperament may be somewhat calmed by the phlegm of Germany.  But if this effect be produced, we can hardly expect that it will be lasting, for in time America will change the temperament of the German just as it has changed the temperament of the Anglo-Saxon.","7eeb06f21dfb4b85738a44b9c1de3758.jpg"],[59045,"209\nSt Louis is a large & well built city of about 280,000 inhabitants.  In the year 1836 it was only a French village of about 2000 souls, almost all of whom were Canadians, & Canadian half-breeds.  In those days, the wild Indian was close upon it.  Now the French & the Indians are both alike obliterated, & railways reach between five & six hundred miles beyond it.  It contains many Churches, some of which are built in very good taste & style.  I never saw red-brick anywhere else used so pleasingly & effectively in pointed? architecture, or in the spire of one of the Churches in this city. I was also much struck with a stone Church, the tower of which was not yet completed.  Each window in the side aisles had a second window over it, in the form of a kind of window head, or marigold.  The main aisle had clerestory windows.  All the windows throughout were filled with stained glass.  This fine Church belonged to the Episcopal unclear.  There are six Epixcopal Congregations in  St Louis.  I have become acquainted with a Cleryman who had just returned from a long tour through Europe & the East.  It was strange on the West bank of the Mississippi, on a spot where Red men had sold their furs, & smoked their pipes, in the memory of the speaker himself to hear expressed the opinion, \"that \"a man of culture & thought had not completed his education, till \"he had seen with his own eyes the scenes on which the great events of \"man's past history had been enacted.\"","34f6c509b1682e72735ea7afd87f26b2.jpg"],[59046,"210\nWhile crossing the Mississippi on the ice I cd not hear unmoved the shouts of skaters cheering, & shouting, & talking merrily in good English, just as if it were on the Serpentine in the Park; & I thought to myself that that small piece of water in the midst of London does not belong more completely to the English race than the Father of Waters himself does now, & must forever.","b48b73b1d3d2519a8a84e872df76e7ec.jpg"],[59047,"Chapter XII   211\nOn leaving St Louis for Cincinnati I took the evening train because as far as Odin, the ground was the same I had lately passed over.  On entering the Carriage I met with an instance of American kindness I should be sorry to have to pass unnoticed.  When I applied for a sleeping berth I found that they were all engaged, except some on the upper tier. As the heated air accumulates against the roof, these upper berths are generally too warm, besides that there is some difficulty in getting in & out of them.  This difficulty would have been very considerably increased in my case, as I happened just at the time to be obliged to carry my arm in a sling.  An American Gentlemand, as I afterwards found a very well known man in Chicago, observing this, came up to me, and insisted on my taking his lower berth & letting him have in exchange my upper one.   When at Chicago I was laid under further obligation to this gentleman which I must unclear to when I reach that place.  He was on of those who during the late war gave up their business, & left their comfortable houses for the tented field, that they might help to save their country from disruption; and he had had the good fortune to accompany Sherman in his memorable","ca87bc4a35db05791877b2e604228461.jpg"],[59048,"212 \nmarch through the South.\nThere were two Red Skins \"on board\" this sleeping care, on their way to Washington to transact the business of their Tribe.  They were tall, bony men but their complexion was not of so dark a copper colour as I had expected.  Their features were coarse & stolid, their only expression being just that of the obstinatetenacity of purpose & of the power of endurance with which History credits their race.  They were accompanied by two half breeds, who appeared a great improvement on the pure stock.  These latter played at cards for hours together, & when not so employed they sang together Heber's? Missionary Hymn and \"Three Blind Mice\" alternately, equally unconscious of the poetry & sentiments of the one, and of the inanity of the other.","c37f3ab751d5afff8851af4b985bf9a8.jpg"],[59049,"213\nEvery one had heard of the Metropolis of Pigs.  And it is rightly so called for the greatness of Cincinnati is founded on cured pigs in a far greater degree than that of Holland was on pickled Herrings.  Here are more than 200,000 souls maintained in life by breeding, fattening, killing, salting, packing, & exporting incredible millions of pigs.  The 200,000 human beings are only 200,000,000 pigs in another form.  The old & the young, the schools & the Churches, the politicians & the men of science of this great city are all created out of pig.  Take away the pigs & they all disappear; double the pigs & they all are doubled.\nAnd the influence of the pigs of Cincinnati is felt all over the world, when an East Anglian farmer sells his improved unclear, or Suffolk porker, its value is affected by the greater or less number of its breathren who grunted their last at Cincinnati during the previous year, or, as the Cincinnatians themselves would say, on the amount of the previous year's \"pork crop.\"\nOf course where so many pigs have to be disposed of one wd expect to find in America some time-x-labour-saving machinery; & I was told that if I went into any of the great factories, which, however, I did not do, I might see machinery in operation, by the aid of which","512096d0c3939775d3afedb0b97d7009.jpg"],[59050,"214\na stream of pigs, that walked into the factory at the front door, alive & grunting, were made to issue, a few minutes afterwards at the opposite door, ready packed for exportation in the three forms of ham, bacon, & lard; each in his passage through the building having been been stabbed in the throat, scraped, eviscerated, jointed, & injected with bacon or ham curing liquor, all by machinery & with the regularity of clock work.","3344690a7602b4832be627c1438f5600.jpg"],[59051,"Simpson?  215\nOne of the most marked peculiarities of American Society is the total absence of all classes higher than those of the Merchant & professional man.  One sees the working of this in many different ways.  For instance it evidently elevates the unclear & character of the classes which they find themselves at the head of Society.  It gives them a dignity & a bearing they wd not otherwise possess.  If there is no one higher in society than a retail shop keeper, then by the force of his position he becomes brave & liberal, & his ideas become enlarged.  I observed this at Denver where there is no higher class.  And I think the same observations cd be made by anyone who wd go so far to judge for himself.  These are good effects which the American system has upon those also who are most humbly placed.  As they feel that they are theoretically, & in some respect practically, equal to those who are even the best placed in society, they endeavour not to disgrace, or altogether to fall short of their position.  This is a strong stimulus among them to education & self-improvement.  It is what has unclear the efforts of many who hae risen in life, & sustained them through many long years of patient industry, & laborious enterprise.  I have no reason to believe a word of all that I ever heard of the offensive self assertion?, & obtrusive incivility of this class, for I never myself suffered from, or unclear any thing of the kind.  Where an Englishman is the complainant, I wd be disposed to think that in most cases he had provoked the treatment he complains of, for no people are more careful about","b38427d4657454e41f23a26d986982d5.jpg"],[59052,"216\ngiving offence than Americans.  This carefulness is taught in their Schools, & is a tradition of American society, coming from the time when among an excitable people the use of the pistol had always been simultaneous with the offence.\nAnother effect of the want in America of what we in Europe regard as the Corrinthian Capital of Society, is the almost entire absence of the literary element.  Not that the Americans have no writers or readers, they have plenty of the former, & are a nation of the latter.  But this leaves very little trace on American society;  Because they have no class whose only real work in life is intellectual.  The chief source of supply for the literary element is with us that vast number of persons, constituting quite an order in the State, who live upon the rent of the land; associated with whom is perhaps a still greater number of families who live more or less on interest & dividends, that is on realized personality?.  The members of this class can only distinguish them selves in life by the exercise of intellectual power.  They have abundant leisure, & every appliance at their command for intellectual culture.  Multitudes of them it is true never rise to any useful conception of the advantages & requirements of their position; still this, & this only is what they are called to.  In this country their work is on the whole not done badly.  As a class they are highly educated.  From them came almost all our Statesmen, & a large proportion of our literary & scientific men.  Their culture it is that with us gives to Society","72b85c5089a52e9c549b651a8da65f50.jpg"],[59053,"217\nits tone & colour.  This intellectualizing element is completely wanting in America.  The effects of it absence are by the European never unfelt for a moment.  he is always conscious that there are no Statesmen, though plenty of politicians, no literary men, though plenty of writers, & no intellectual class, though much has been done to cultivate the intellect.","bb9c3107de0cb0924ff6487859c771cc.jpg"],[59054,"Simpson  218\nAs was my custom whenever I went I asked permission to visit\n& inspect some of the schools of the place. The Superindent of schools\nfor Cincinnati was so good as to take me over the largest graded school\nin the city. I've spent in it three hours. There were present about\n600 children.The school was divided into six grades. In New York\nand most other places two of the grades wd have belonged to the Grammar\nschool. I've began at the bottom & worked up to the top. They teach\nreading, as is generally now done in America, phonetically. This they think\nas easier method. They are not at all ambitious in their reading books,\nbecause they do not aim at conveying knowledge of things through the \nmedium of reading unclear, but content themselves with creating the habit of reading correctly, & with attention to the meaning of what is read, & this is more likely to be secured, if the book consists of little interesting stories, than wd be the case if it contained solid information.  What, in the upper grades, they write today, is what they remember of an object unclear given on the previous day.  This trains them to remember, to think, & to compose.  There is no writing from copies which children generally get through as quickly as they can without any attention or thought.  Singing is carefully taught.  And so is elementary drawing, particularly in connection with the construction of maps.  They begin the study of Geography with the Geography of the school-room - which is the North, the East, the South, & the West side; & then they go on to what is beyond.  The Geography of the United States is taught carefully.  It often struck me in America","ea637bd10f3aed58c28bbc0cfbc2204d.jpg"],[59055,"219\nthat the Geography of the rest of the world was almost ignored.  In these schools the reading was very good, & from the readings & correctings of their answers, it was evident that they were in the habit of attending to what they were reading; & that they completely mastered its meaning.  It is not to be expected that children, when they leave school will keep up their reading, if they have not been taught to read with facility, & so far to understand what they read as to take an interest in it.\nThe key to the success of these schools, as of so many other city schools in America, is that they are graded, & that each grade has a room & teacher exclusively to itself. \nThe whole time of the teacher is devoted to one class.  No member therefore of the class can ever during school hour be idle. This system, too, naturally employs more largely than any other the oral method of conveying instruction.  The teacher stands up before the class, & teaches it.  The eye & the ear are always busy.  There is no unclear, no whispering, no poring over books, or pretending to be poring over them.  All the teachers in this school appeared to attend equally to all the classes, & to be responsible for the state of each.  Boys & girls are taught together in all grades except the highest.  The district in which this fine school is situated is inhabited chiefly by German Jews, & more than half the 600 pupils were children of such parents. The Roman Catholic children were","d0a0dc4d7fb9bcd1c277d222af704ff6.jpg"],[59056,"220\nonly six or sevent per cent of the whole.  In the State of Ohio they do not, as is done in the State of New York, allow the Roman Catholics a part of the school rate? for the maintenance of separate schools.  If they wish to bring up their children in schools of their own, of course they are at liberty to do so, but they must pay for such schools themselves.","7a72fb86e1810e595e461045b8c4074e.jpg"],[59057,"Evans?  221\nI observed at Cincinnati, & in some other cities, that the American Jews affect in their synagogues a Moorish style of architecture.  As American cities can have no historical buildings, there is nothing in them to counteract the unclear of commerce, & of their method of laying out cities, except the Churches.  And as many of them, as is always the case in America, are embellished with towers or spires, their redeeming effect on the appearance of the town is very considerable.\nAs I am on the subject of American towns?, I trust that my friends in that part of the world will excuse me for never having been persuaded by them to fall into ecstaciesat the contemplations of the plan of Philadelphia, which they point to with feelings of enthusiasim, as the very perfection of taste & judgment in the art of building cities.  There is, however, as far as I cd see, nothing in Philadelphia which is not also in St Louis & Cincinnati, & a hundred other cities, in embryo, or in adolescence.  The three cities, whose names I have just mentioned are, saving their reverence, as like one another as three peas.  They have no main street, but a number of parallel streets, at equal distances from each other.These are numbered, first, second, third etc?.  Another set of streets, again exactly parallel to each other cut the first at right angles.  This second set of streets, in the three cities I have names, are called after different trees, Bitch, Elm, Hicory [[etc?}}.  This is everything.  It is the very democracy of houses?: for all the Streets & blocks are","f96b451097ab82c8ea8327907dcfaafe.jpg"],[59058,"222\nequal.  No one is larger, or wider, or in anyway better than another.\nOf course, the result of this must be that there is not a unclear of difference between one town & another, all having been cast in the same mould.  It wd be laughable, were it not tiresome, to have not a thousand cities in America, but one city reproduced over & over again, wherever you go.  St. Louis & Cincinnati are about the same size, & have much the same kind of site, & I believe that if a man sho had spent a week in each of them were a month? afterward carried blindfold into one of them, & set down in the middle of the town, he wd be unable to say in which of the two he was.  I know no two things that are so like each other, except it be two farms on the Prairie, where every farm is just the fac-simile of every other farm, so that it is really impossible to guess how one living on the Prairie, unless he develps a new sense to meet the circumstances he is placed in, can ever distinguish his own home.\nI venture to think that the Americans are under another mistake about their towns; they suppose that their method of parallel Streets, not named, but enumerated & lettered, is a great help to the memory, & facilitates very much the finding of any house one is in search of. Never did fallible mortals entertain so erroneous an idea.  Instead of a name, Rivoli, or Cheapside, which entirely fixes itself in the mind, you have to remember a figure & letter; & as neither figures nor letter suggest ideas, the thing is impossible.  In truth you have to remember","ee45b3170320182b60a131204a49dae5.jpg"],[59059,"223\ntwo figures & a letter.  For instance No 24, G. Street, corner of 25th Street.  There is no faculty in the human mind which enables one to retain this direction.  In five minutes all certainty is lost as to whether is was G. or E., 25th or 26th.  Perhaps is was C, perhaps it was 36th.\nIn fact the American have but one town, & in the nomenclature of the streets of this one town, they have done every thing the perverse ingenuity of man can devise to render it confusing.","a90e1320c213706a683cfed06d5d8ef9.jpg"],[59060,"Chapter XIII      224\nThe valley of the Ohio pleased me - all things considered - more than any other district I saw in the United States.  The land was generally very fertile, & much diversified with river side levels & contiguous hills; with cultivated land, & wood-land; with apple & peach orchards, & with wheat & maize.  Its most novel feature was the space devoted to the culture of the vine.\nIn many parts of the Union, as in this State, California, & several others a great deal of wine is already made; & the planting of vineyards is yearly extending.  I tasted two wines, sparkling Catawba, & a red California wine which are really good now, & which no doubt in course of time will become still better.  The former was a little too sweet, but that is a fault, if it be regarded as a fault in America, which can easily be remedied by carrying the process of fermentation a little further.  There is every prospect of a larger proportion of America, than of Europe, producing wine; in that case the same proportion of its inhabitants will become a wine, & not a beer, or spirit drinking population.  In Europe we attribute certain differences of national character to this difference in the beverage of a people.  It appears as if in this highly favoured region, upon which Nature has heaped all her gifts, that nothing in the way of climate, occupation, or even food which can diversity life & character will be wanting.

And this is the way in which all these fertile North Western States are filling up.\nOh arriving at Chicago my first thought was to see the Lake, one of the great fresh water seas I had been reading of since I was a boy.  I was now within a few paces of it, & was only prevented by the houses from seeing it.  I had driven to the Sherman House, a large Hotel on one side of the Square in the centre of which stands the City Hall; & I had been told that the only good view of the city, & of the Lake was to be had from the gallery round the top of the the dome of this building.  It was not long before I ascended the stairs that led to it; & as I stepped out on the balcony, the boundless blue water, reflecting the undimmed hazeless sky, & washing up almost to the foot of this building & stretching away beyond the horizon, suddenly burst in the view.  It was Lake Michigan.  Imagination does much on such occasions.  I felt satisfied. It was not only worth seeing, but it was worth coming to see.  Here, in these vast reservoirs is Nature carrying on some of her hydraulic operations upon the","a6244b6b8c5cba2c8fececfffdb43693.jpg"],[59062,"226\ngrandest scale in the world.  Here, too, at this very spot, at its sothern point, the countless Buffalo used to drink the wak of the Lake; & here it was that the Red man was waiting to welcome him; & now the White man is ploughing, & harvesting, & building cities all around its shores, & its wakes are wafting to this spot the produce of his labours, & then bearing it away again to feed the millions of New England & of the distant sea-board cities, & even to all the deficient supplies of Old England & France.","d29042bfebd2d3722e89f895f8978f23.jpg"],[59063,"unclear  227\nChicago well deserves its reputation. Its stores, & private houses & Churches are good, & wd be so considered in any city.  Its stores are in buildings two floors higher than the shopes of Oxford, or Regent St, as is generally the case in all the large American cities.  They have an air of solidity, & are not entirely devoid of external decoration.  There are suburbs containing many good private residences, the best of which are to be seen in Michigan Avenue, along the shores of the Lake.  These are built of a cream coloured stone, & many of them give me a favourable idea of the architectural taste, as well as of the wealth, of their inhabitants.  From the gallery of the City Hall I counted twenty three towers & spires, but this is very far from giving the number of Churches, as perhaps the majority of them are without these embellishments.  In the central parts of the city where all the buildings are good & massive, & the smoke, for here they burn bituminous coal, has put a complexion upon them something like that of London, you cd never guess that you were standing in a city so young, that many of its inhabitants, still young themselves, remember the erection of the first brick house in the place; you wd be more likely to suppose that you were surrounded by the evidences & appearances of the commerical prosperity of many generations.\nOn my mentioning to \"a citizen\" of Chicago the number of the Churches I had counted from the top of the City Hall; \"Yes,\" he replied, \"we are a religious people outwardly\".","31ac7c5ec1139f8553b4dc8ac4399a57.jpg"],[59064,"unclear from here.

For instance, wherever in the city a case of small pox occurs, a large yellow sheet is posted to the door of the house, announcing in conspicuous letters, \"Small pox here.\"  I cd not but compare this wise regulation with our careless unclearon the same subject at home.  This very disease of small pox, or scarlet fever, or any other infectious disease may have struck down many of the inmates of a house, yet according to our custom it is allowable for the occupiers of the house, if they keep unclear to invite customers to enter, & to sell them articles of unclear, or of food, which in seome way or other may become unclear of infection.\nAnother very useful arrangement I found in operation here is that by which the whole city is instantly informed of the existence of a fire, & of the locality in which it has burst out.  The city is, for this purpose, divided into districts; each district being known by its number.  In some central & conspicuous place in each is a box containing an apparatus, by which a bell may be rung in a room at the City Hall.  In this room there are men constantly watching the bells.  As soon as the bell of any district is rung the watchers reply with a hurried kind of chime on the large bell of the city hall, which can be heard in every part of the city.  This is to announce that there is a fire. There is then a pause of half a minute, after which","b40a5e349adf5f0b12301ea96e7b3599.jpg"],[59065,"Liberality of Chicago Merchants   229\nthe number of the district is struck on the bell.  This informs every one of the exact locality of the fire.  The policeman on duty in each district is the person whose duty it is to go to the box & ring the bell.  In order however to save time it is competent? for any respectable citizen to do this; for the place where the key of the box is kept is always mentioned on the outside of the box; & the keeper of the the key is ordered to give it up to any respectable applicant.  I was surprised to find how often during the night announcements of fire were made from the city hall.\nA few days before my arrival at Chicago there had been, the best part of the city, one of those monster? fires which are of such frequent occurrence in American towns.

In a few hours after the occurrence, before the embers had ceased to smoulder, enough had been subscribed to rebuild the Hall of the Young Mens Christian Association on a larger scale than that of the one that had been destroyed; & the Merchants of the place had met, & and had put down their names for considerable sums to form a fund, upon which their brother Merchants who had been burnt out by the great fire & lost their stock in trade, might draw for","178a8c7853f6b4efab63e6dcb443b16c.jpg"],[59066,"(d) To follow the Paragraph, the the Chapter on Chicago, which dexcribes \"The Liberality of Chicago Merchants.\"  271\n12gb?\nIt is commonly supposed that the Americans are entirely devoted to the pursuit of the dollar.  It is true that they pursue the dollar more energetically, intelligently, & successfully than any other people, but no mistake can be greater than that of supposing that they pursue it exclusively.  First there is no other country in the world in which the political sentiment is so widely diffused, & so deeply felt; where so much time & thought are devoted to it; where it calls forth so much hard intellectual work in the forms of writing, reading & speaking.  And this is true not of one, but of all classes, from the top to the bottom of Society.\nNor is there any other country in which the religious sentiment works so vigorously & so spontaneously, & is so fruitful in great, obvious, & ponderable results. And this as well among those who labour as among those who elsewhere are supposed to have almost the monopoly of thinking & feeling.\nAgain in no other country do a million persons taken not from a horizontal but from a vertical section of Society, read so much; and there can be no surer gauge of this amount of pure mental activity than the amount of reading.  The Americans are a nation of readers, & read far more then any other nation in the world.  and not only do they read more, but what they read has more effect on the them than in the case with any other people.\nIn the three great departments then of intellectual activity & life","800139baf70c0fdbc7a7827ec744e659.jpg"],[59067,"12g.c:\npolitics, religion, and in the use of literature this people who are supposed to devote their whole soul to the pursuit of the dollar, are greatly in advance of ourselves & of all other nations.\nBut whatever the amount of toil Americans may impose on themselves in getting money, it is not done with a view to saving.  The American who hoards is a rare exception. They will make a good fight for the purpose of enlarging their business, & increasing their income.  But, when this increase comes, it is used & not accumulated. All the world know that there are no other people who spend so much on their families & houses, on traveling & entertaining, in hospitality and in charity.\nBelongs to Mr. Zincke's Winter in the United States.","0df2e5cfe637a6e4c9ab3a2b261004cb.jpg"],[59068,"230\nas much as was needed for reguilding, & reestablishing themselves in business.  Repayment was not to be thought of till the recovery of their affairs conveniently admitted of it.\nOn Sunday evening I attended a Service at Trinity Church, having been attracted by the exterior of the building which is a conspicuous object from some points in Michigan Avenue.  I mention this because I observed a peculiarity in the means used for lighting it, which might occasionally be adopted with advantage in London, and large cities where sites are costly.  I suppose the space was so confined by dwelling houses on the north & south sides that windows in the wall of the aisles were in-admissible?.  This difficulty has be met boldly by enlarging the clesesotry? windows, & adding in the roof rows of quatre-foil sky-lights, filled with very dark stained glass.  I sd have been glad to have seen the effect of this by daylight.  Nine tenths of the congregation I saw in this Church that evening were Gentlemen, from which I inferred that the Service was intended mainly for the rougher sex.\nWhat is conventionally regarded by us as the American type of features is not uncommon on the Eastern sea-bord, but is seldom seen in the West.  The Clergyman whom I saw officiating in Trinity Church might have sate for the bust of a Greek Philosopher.  He had a unclear head with much refinement about it; a lofty forehead, a straight nose, & a magnificent beard.  He spoke in a manly & soldierly way of what he had unclear on the battle-fields of the late war.","c1f60a6dc1b7a344700ca3360fc53030.jpg"],[59069,"Simpson  231\nA new & completely distinct type of features has been developed in Americal.  Of all races of men that from which the Americans are descended has the greatest mixture & variety of features.  We have no facial type.  We have round heads & long heads; low, high, prominent, & receding foreheads; large jaws & small; our noses are infinite in multiformity, we have long & short, thick & fine, pug, Roman, & straight, & each in all degrees.  In American, however, the whole of this variety has been lost & obliterated.  The descendants of the most various featured race of mankind have become the most uniform featured race in the world. Whatever part of the country you may be in, you will find the same thing.  As a general rule the native Americans all have straight noses, oft straight foreheads, & small jaws.  Their faces have been brought to one type, & that a far more intellectual one than what we are familiar with in the old country:  it is almost the antipodes of that to which the conventional John Bull belongs.  To be convinced of this one has only to look at the features of the thirty or forty persons one may meet in a railway car, or at those who are seated with one in a street car - or at the Americans one meets in a private house, or at a place of public amusement.  The straight nose & forehead are every where the rule.  I saw at Richmond a frame containing the photograhy of the fifty Southernmen?","76be74b09551d9591190afb6f1b73100.jpg"],[59070,"232\nwho had most distinguished Membership in the loate war.  There was not a single pug, or short, or Roman nose among them.  It has been just the same with the Greeks, whatever race of people had inhabited the soil of Greece had unclear  the Greek type of feature.  The present inhabitants of Greece are chiefly Bulgarians, but their features are Greek.\nIn America this transformation is observable chiefly in those of Anglo-Saxon descent.  The French, both of Canada & Louisiana, retain their French features.  This may give  us some clue to the cause which has acted on our descendants.  The French have retained French habits of life.  They have not given in to & adopted the American love of excitement, love of work, & devotion to business, which never pause to enjoy life, but are always struggling forward, & doing something, & doing it at high purpose.  It is also observable that the descendants of the easy-going Germans retain their old European type longer that those who are of Anglo-Saxon parentage.","231b9397ea381931703389dd81a2b6db.jpg"],[59071,"233\nI was taken over some of the Schools of Chicago by the Superintendent of Schools for the City.  Those I saw were chiefly used by the children of German & Irish Parents.  They did not appear so quick as the children of native Americans.  The variety also of feature, & more general fullness of face observable among them, indicated their foreign extraction.  Americanization in these particulars takes place in the second or third generation.  They were cleanly? clearly? & orderly, & looked well clothed & well fed.  In the Illinois system there are ten grades, the tenth is the lowest in the primary school, unclear & the first the highest in the Grammar School.  No copy slips are used in these schools.  They write at first from something set before them on the Black board.  When sufficiently advanced they write each day from memory something they were taught on the previous day.  In Chicago the number of children attending school falls very far short indeed of the number of those who are of an age to attend.  This is what might have been expected in a town that has grown to such dimensions in a single generation.  Great efforts however are being made to overtake the work.  The difficulty just at present is to get School buildings quickly enough.  It is certain that neither the city itself, nor their zealous & able Superintendent, will fall short of the occasion.\nThe Americans are in the habit of speaking very disparagingly of their Official class.  I never heard on speak in any other tone on this subject.  If the canon? that whatever all men, at all times, & in all places,","f48fca1fa9e1cf3d7bc5c1fdcd64967d.jpg"],[59072,"234\naffirm must be true, then this class in the United States occupies a position of very bad preeminance.  No one is spared.  The President is a Judas Iscariot who has sold his country.  Senators, & Representatives are a set of log-rollers & wine-unclear who make, on an average of the whole body, 6000 a year out of their votes in Congress.  Judges receive such small salaries that they must also receive bribes.  Every town-Councillor (if that is the right title) Every exciseman, every custom-house officer, every tax assessor, or collector is open to unclear, if the argument cited be the dollar.  None of them are allowed more than four years for making their fortunes.  These are the mildest terms in which they inveigh against what they call the universal rottenness from top to bottom of the Oficial class throughout the Union.  On this very dangerous & delicate ground a stranger can only act the part of a Reporter.  he cannot give any comment, or even have any opinion of his own.  I feel however that I cd? wd? be guilty of foul ingratitude, if I did not give the results of my own experience & observation with respect to one class at all events of American public servants.  I saw much of the Superindendents of Schools, & was every where struck with their devotion to their work, & with their ability.  As far as I cd judge the public are well & faithfully served by these officers.  And as the Superintendent in each city is practically, though not theoretically, the doer of all that is done in the general management unclear is responsible for the condition of all the Schools in the city, his office is in the unclear second in importance to none.","88567b99be2d23069e76ce0c05e42a17.jpg"],[59073,"235\nOn a Sunday, while I was at Chicago, the Gentleman who had given up to me his berth in the sleeping care to Cincinnati, too me to see one of the large Sunday Schools, which have been organized on a very extensive scale in this great Western city, & from which great results are expected. The one I went to see is held in a Congregationalist Church.  It is customary at the end of the meeting to give out the number of those who are present, as every body is supposed to be interested in the maintenance & spread of the movement.  At the meeting I witnessed there were 99? persons present, of whom 4? were teachers.  They now have in the city seventy five of these schools; of these, however, only five are organized on the scale of the one I am speaking of.  One of the five is held in an Episcopal Church, I believe that of the Holy Trinity.  The pupils in these Sunday Schools are not confined to one class in society, or to children, or to the members of any partticular community?.  All classes attend them, so do many grown up persons; & all religious denominations, except the Roman Catholics, are to be found among the taught & the teachers.\nThe work of the day commenced by singing three hymns, which were evidently intended to excite religious emotions of a highly enthusiastic kind.  The leading manager then recited thecommandments all present repeating after each commandment the petition of our Ante-Communion Service.  To this was added what follows the commandments in the American Episcopal Service \"Hear also what the Lord Jesus Christ says \"Thous shalt love the Lord","0bec45ec3615c46c24af5187942b990f.jpg"],[59074,"236\n\"Thy God with all thy heart, & all with thy soul, & with all thy mind.  This \"is the first & great Commandment.  And the second is like unto it, Thou \"shall love thy neighbour as theyself.  On these tow Commandment hang \" 'all the law & the prophets'.\"  The last Chapter in St Mark's Gospel was then read, the chief manager reading the first verse, & all present simultaneously reading the second, & so on 193 Simpson- throughout the CHapter.  The object of their reading it in this alternate method is to prevent monotony, & to keep up attention.  The pupils had been requested to commit five verses of this Chapter to memory.  These verses were now repeated simultaneously.  This was all that was learnt by heart; & even the learning of this was left entirely to the discretion of each pupil.  A prayer was then offered, but as a preliminary to it the subjects it was proposed to make mention of in the prayer were announced with a few brief & pointed comments.  The whole assemblage was now divided into classes of fourteen in each, with a separate teacher for each.  This was doen without a single person leaving his seat, by the simple process of reversing the back of every alternate seat, so that where before there were a hundred pews holding seven persons each, there were now fifty holding fourteen each.  The change was effected in a few seconds.  Each teacher now commented on, & expounded to his class the five verses that had been committed to memory.  Then followed another hymn, & another short prayer being founded entirely on the five verses which had formed the subject for the day's instruction.  The whole was concluded with the singing of the doxology.","5b79ad3bdc281cf2a515a1f21ae5c5ce.jpg"],[59075,"237\nThis Sunday School was divided into three grades.  First came the Infants.  They were placed in a large room behind the west end gallery, & over the Porch?.  None of these cd read.  Nothing was attempted in this department except awakening the moral sentiments, & teaching a few facts of Christian History, & if possible a little Christian doctrine.  This was done by telling the children little stories.  Three of these I heard.  My friend, who was the chief doer of all that was done & taught on the occasion of my visit, told these infants, in a very effective manner, well adapted to their little understandings, how he had spent on himself, after a long & uncertain struggle, which he minutely described to them, the first ten cents he had ever unclear; & how ashamed he afterwards felt of himself.\nAs soon as they can read they are promoted into the second grade which has its place in the gallery.  After a time they are passed to the third or highest grade, which has it's place in the body of the Church.\nIt is believed that this Sunday school organization has already effected a great deal of good by bringing all classes together, & by unclear in a way nothing else cd the destitute, the ignorant, & the reckless.  And still more abundant fruit is expected from it in the future.\nWho is there but will entertain bright hopes for America, when among the rural population the moral tone is sound & healthy, & in the cities there is so much zeal for doing good.","9ba0ecadd6b9275ac6024a62ece5163e.jpg"],[59076,"[[Evans?}}   238\nFrom the time I left New York, till I reached Chicago, I had nowhere seen in the towns clear drinking water.  At New Orleans it was of the colour of a Mulatto, at Cincinnati of a Mistizo, & at the intermediate places of the intermediate shades.  At Richmond it had a kind of ochcreous? tint.  The reason is the same everywhere.  The wells, with the water of which the towns are supplied, all run through a yellowish or reddish loamy soil, sometimes sandy, sometimes clayey.  This is easily worn away, & carried off in suspension by the stream, and is largely added to after rains, by the surface washing of the country.  At Chicago by a boldly conceived, & most successfully carried out plan the whole city is supplied with the purest water.  A tunnel, large enough for two mules to work abreast in it, was carried out for a distance of two miles beneath the Lake.  At this point they have reached water which is perfectly free from all the impurities of the shore; & here it is admitted into the tunnel in sufficient volume to supply all the wants of a population of about 280,000 souls.  It is calculated that this tunnel will be ample for all that 100,000 more inhabitants will require.  When the population has grown to this extent a second tunnel will have to be constructed.  The water is pumped up from the level of the tunnel to reservoirs that are above the level of the city.  Which unclear is not the original level of the Prairie, but considerably above it, for it having been found, often a great part of the city was built, that it was subject to being occasionally","39e6ff8b921645fcc891fa55158f1738.jpg"],[59077,"239\nflooded, they raised the ground several feet.  In doing this they did not pull down, or bury any part of the streets, & blocks of houses that were already completed, but lifted them up to the desired height, by hydraulic machinery.  In this way the Sherman House, one of the large Americal Hotels, (I stayed in it while at Chicago) was elevated to the level of the raised street, without a guest leaving it, or any interruption of its business.","6e1ab2dd7295b9e03590101dc05c99e2.jpg"],[59078,"240\nA foreigner is much struck with the amount of business going on at an American Post Office.  Society not being in so settled & stationary a condition as with us, a far greater proportion of letters are directed to the Post Office; & must be called for.  A list of the name of the persons whose letters have not een called for, is printed twice a week, & hung up in the Post Office Hall, for the inspection of the public.  This list is divided intothree separate parts, English, French, & German each part is hung up by itself in its own frame; & there is a window of inquiry for each of the three nationalities.  In the Hall of the Post Office, or rather in the screen that separates the office from the Hall, are inmeasurerable pigeon-holes, each with a door to the Hall side as well as the Office side.  The key of the Office side door is kept by the officials; of the Hall side door by the person to whom the box has been assigned.  Into this box that persons letters are put as soon as a mail is sorted; & he can go, or send at any hour of the day, or night, unlock his door, & take them out.  He is not therefore obliged to wait for the general delivery, but can get his letters as soon as the mail arrives.  There is, too, less chance of his letters being lost, for they never get into the hands of the letter-carrier.  And, as every one whose correspondence is of any unclear adopts this plan, the number & labour of the letter-carriers is much diminished.  On account of the large amount of business always going on at the Post Office they separate the Ladies from the Gentlemen, assigning","571a82118a9025e3d4562034b584cc84.jpg"],[59079,"241\nthem a place for making inquiries, getting their letters, & buying stamps quite distinct from that assigned to the men.\nThese are good arrangements.  My personal experience, however, of the working of the Office is not quite favourable.  Two thirds of the letters posted for me miscarried, & the remaining third I only got after a great deal of trouble.  It is the rule in America that all officials must be changed as often as the President is changed:  & this for the double reason of enabling the President to reward those who worked for his election; & because it is a principle in democracy that all good things of this kind shall be made to fo as far as possible, which can only be done by making the tenure of each occupant short.  I found that this had the disadvantage that the Clerks were not retained so long as to enable them to become familiar with the letter[Z.  In consequence of this in the direction of all the letters written to me from Europe it was mistaken for an L: & in the directions of the letters written to me from New York, where it appears the Z is decorated with a cross-bar, it was mistaken for an F.","ef36e69fe699b14a16a0129ec9a1d402.jpg"],[59080,"242\nThe feelings of the Americans on the subject of Aristocracy is is very far from being the same in all classes, or sections of the community.  I have already made some slight reference to the way in which the German part of the population regard this institution.  We must consider not only what they think, but also how much they count for in America.  They count for a great deal.  Because though they do not take a very prominent part in politics, still from their numbers, their intelligence, & their wealth, they form every where in the North, & in a  still greater degree in the Great West, a very influential portion of Society.  And as to this matter there is no mistaking their thoughts & feelings.  They hate Aristocracy as if it were the foul fiend in human society; and of all Aristocracies they hate that of England the most; because they regard it as the purest type the world exhibits of this mighty evil.  We may be sure then that there is nothing they wd not do to humbler the Aristocracy of England.  Theirs is a philosphical, instinctive, active, implacable hatred.  And the unclear & influence of it is just in proportion to the strength of the German element in American Society.\nBut far beyond the Germans in solid telling influence are the great masses of the native population.  They may be described as a stirring, unclear, self-educated people, as very much led by news-papers, and generally ready believers in local politicians.  All these, too, have an active dislike to the idea of Aristocracy, or, as it presents itself to their matter-of-fact minds, of privileged classes.  They condemn it on two grounds.  It is, they say,","37a15bcaffb5416d09e1e2de97bab535.jpg"],[59081,"243\na ridiculous institution for it assumes a superiority which it is impossible? can exist; & it is an unjust institution, because it degrades the great bulk of society by putting them in an inferior position.  Their ideas on the subject appear to be more closely connected with contempt than with bitterness.  Still they are distinctly felt, & clearly defined.  And they, too, wd be ready, were there ever an opening for anything of the kind, to join in a Crusade against privileged classes.  They wd be glad to lend a hand in the overthrow of any instituttion which consecrates the denial of what they regard as the natural equality of man.\nThere remains the class which corresponds with what we call the Upper Then Thousand; that is, the class of the refined, & highly educated.  Now these persons do themselves form the Aristocracy of American society.  It is true that speaking generally they are all in business of one kind or another, some even in what we cd speak of as retail business, but, in the almost total absence of any thing higher, they constitues, & feel that they do so, a kind of social Aristocracy.  And though most of them wd, theoretically, condemn Aristocracies, yet they wd have neither a contemptuous? contemptuousness? nor? or? a bitter feeling against what they were condemning.  Some of this class, following an inextingiushable feeling of human nature, have begun to look about & see whether they are not connected by descent with old families of the old Country.  And this instantly gives rise to exclusiveness of feeling, because they","2c99ce6da3fa6f9272202858db1a876b.jpg"],[59082,"244\nare seeking for an advantage in which the multitude cannot participate.  Here therefore it wd be contradictory & inconsistent were there any storng feeling against Aristocracy.  Of themselves such persons wd be far more disposed to leave the thing alone, than to join in any endeavours to overthrow it.  But, practically, it is of little importance? except to themselves, what this class thinks or feels.  The majority disposes? of everything in America; & the first step forward gaining its support in the race for power & splace, is to suppress in one's self everything that wd be distasteful to it.","47863ff80a55e410a86ed52dded2330a.jpg"],[59083,"To conclude the chapter on Chicago - following the Paragraphs which describe the feelings of Americans on the subject of Aristocracy\n245\nAn American claims the same social position for himself which in Europe is accorded to the unclear of hereditary wealth & hereditary titles: & he grounds his claim on the simple fact that he is an American.

At home we have been taught to regard Chicago as the extremity of civilization, & therefore as one of the wonders of the world.  But when you have turned your back on Chicago, & been borne away into the western Prairie by the locomotive for five hundred miles, you find that you have reached a thriving town, of brick buildings & large Hotels, containing now sixteen thousand inhabitants, & which is destined to become, probably in a very few years, a second Chicago.  For being on the Pacific Railway, the grandest of all railways, as well as on that grandest of all arterial lines of water communication, the Missouri, which is navigable for a thousand miles beyond the town, for the same steamer that might have ascended the stream from New Orleans, it must soon become the depot for the two greatest lines of American traffic - that between the East & the West, & that between the North & the South, which all? will? cross here.

On returning some weeks afterwards when the ice was hourly expected to break up, the train I recrossed it in was the last to used it.  Again we traversed it, at a snails' pace, feeling our way as we went; again we heard the creaking, & saw the bending & swaying of the rickety? fabric, many fearing that this last journey wd be the one too many, & that it wd not be swept away by the ice, but shaken to pieces by use.

It was on the right hand side to me going Westward, & did not reach up to the rails within a mile or two.  The front of the fire as we passed along it was five or six miles long.  The flames had not a uniform appearance.  In slight depressions, where moisture hung longer, & therefore the grass & prairie plants were thick & high, the flames rose about fifteen feet, but where the blazing had subsided, the smouldering remains of plant that had more substance than the rest appeared like rows of stars.

I was not to near to this as I had been to the Prairie, but it did not strike me, judging however from a distance, that it's effects were grander.  There seemed a great deal more smoke than flames, which streamed off down the wind like large bodies of cloud.  I heard however that sometimes the appearance of this Forest burning on the Mountains was very grand.

The fire generally occurs through the carelessness of persons who are camping out.  The waste of valuable timber is thus erroneous.\nAs we passed? over the Prairie the unclear becomes unclear that fire is the sole cause of the absence of trees.  The Prairie was once covered with trees, because when fire is kept off by cultivations, & the earth loosened by the plough, so as to admit light & air to a greater depth than before, young trees at once appear.  Of course the parent trees must at some time or other have grown on the spot.  unclear the seeds that were sufficiently near the undisturbed surface to germinate, had germinated, & the young plants that issued from them had been destroyed by fire.  Those seeds which chance had buried more deeply waited for the aid of man to give proof of their presence in the soil.\nAgain both forest & fruit trees when planted by the hand of man thrive well on the Prairie, if only fire be kept from them.\nAnd wherever in the Prairie, as on the rocky faces of Bluffs, or the banks of streams, fire cannot reach, on account of the absence of sufficient grass & undergrowth to convey it, trees, as pines, oaks, willows & poplar abound.  The great accumulations of black vegetable mould are to be accounted for in the same way:  they are formed out of the burnt & half burnt vegetable matter left by the annual fires of no one can tell how long a period.  In the Valley of the Platte this vegetable mould appears to have been carried away by the","1fddda44ac326a4aeb40801ac7b61a80.jpg"],[59091,"252\nstream, which has ever been shifting its channel from side to side between the Bluffs which boundthe valley, in so doing floating off the lighter portions of the soil, & leaving sand & gravel only in its deserted bed.","1d2c31f802fa598d4547b82091db22fd.jpg"],[59092,"253\nOn the dry Prairie between Omaha & the Mountains I saw for the first time some of the [Feral?} Nature of American in abundance.  Hitherto I had frequently observed that there was almost a total absence of animal life from the road-side.  I cd count up the rare occasions in which I had seen either bird or beast.  I had twice seen colonies of a social crow resembling our rook.  In Georgia I had seen two birds, one about the size of a [unclear], the other rather smaller than a Sparrow.  In Alabama I had seen some wild deer & wild ducks.  In a journey of several thousand miles I had seen no other wild four-footed, or feathered creature. I had attributed this deficiency of the latter partly to the severity of American winters which had taught them migratory habits, & partly to the [unclear] of the population in the southern states, for though it is true that the presence of civilized man is incompatible with the existence of some species, yet there are other species to which man by his cultivation of the ground, & as it were by the crumbs that fall from his table, becomes the chief purveyor, & whose numbers therefore increase almost in proportion to the degree in which a country becomes settled.  But here on this arid plain, & in mid winter, neither naturalist, nor sportsman, cd have had any thing to complain of.  Animal life was in abundance.  During the day I saw from the windows of the car three herds of Antelope, in one of which I counted thirty eight, two wolves, Prairie fowl in great","2281b662d6554f4cef47ba4eedfbd4ca.jpg"],[59093,"254\nnumbers, plenty of a species of bird resembling our English Lark, several hawks, & innumerable colonies of Prairie dogs.  As their villages are frequently at a distance from water these agile & amusing little animals are supposed to be capable of living without drinking.  I saw nothing of the owls & rattlesnakes who have been admitted by the Prairie dogs to a joint tenancy of their subterranean homes.  I have only mentioned what I saw from the railway car.  Doubtless if one were to examine on foot the banks of the river, & the rocky Bluffs that [unclear] the valley, my small list might easily be made a large one. The valley was strewed for hundreds of miles with the bones of the Buffalo & marked with the still unobliterated basins which showed the spot in which he had rolled himself in the dry sandy soil on coming up out of the water of the Platte.  Experience corrects the common error that animal life in any district will be found in proportion to the vigour of its vegetable life.  No where is vegetation more vigouris than in the mighty Forests of South American & Western Africa, but they are very far from abounding in animal life.  On the contrary vegetable life is poor & scanty in Southern Africa & nowhere in the world is there so great a number of species & of individuals of the [unclear] quadripeds.  Something similar is observable in the dry valley of the Platte.  The obvious requirement being not abundance of vegetation, but enough of that kind of vegetation the animals require, & either that kind of [covert?], or such an absence of [covert?], as shall most [conduce?] to their security.","4c0583af3c3a9db452ebc12c864293c2.jpg"],[59094,"255\nFrequently, when I had mentioned my intention of going to the Rocky Mountains by way of Omaha & Denver, I had been cautioned against Shyenne City.  \"Sir, it is the hardest place on this Continent.\"  By which was meant that it contained a choiser collection of hardened villains, & a larger proportion of them to its population, than any other place; & that in consequence it was harder there than anywhere else to keep out of a scrape.  it is called Shyenne, because nine months before I was there, at which time it had three thousand inhabitants, the Chien, or Dog Indians had scalped a white man on what was then the open Prairie but is now the site of the City.  Nine months had sufficed for building & peopling the city.  City on the Plains may mean a single house.  At a place called La Park, where there was but one wooden shanty, I heard a Gentleman ask its proprietor \"if anyone was then talking of building a second house in that City?\"  Shyenne City is built entirely of wood.  There is no Company that will insure any goods, or houses in the place. What so suddely called it into existence was the opening of the Pacific Railway to this point.  Here then every one coming from the  Pacific, & [ultra montane?] States takes the rail for the East, & every one leaving the Rail for one of those States takes his place in one of Wells & Fargo's Coaches.  There are therefore people always arriving from both directions with plenty of money.","7af7016e5d872bbbcb065f44556c4840.jpg"],[59095,"256\nIt is also the natural place (as there is nothing behind it for five hundred miles back to Omaha) for all those who are employed beyond it in the constuction of the Railway through the Mountains, to spend their money at, & too, for many of the gold-washers & gold-miners from the Mountains.  All these are the birds of [unclear] of the place; but they it is who attract the two classes of permanent inhabitants, if such a word is suitable to any residents, in a town only nine months old.  Of these two classes one is respectable, the other not.  The respectable class is that of the tradesmen.  The one that is not, consists of the rowdies, gamblers, & desperadoes who have always formed the scum & dirt on the top of the foremost waves of advancing civilization in America, & which that wave has now borned on to this place, & thrown them into it all together.\nThe same causes in the winter of 1866-67 made a place called Julesburg, about one hundred & fifty miles back from Shyenne, the point at which for the time extreme rowdyism, but of a lower class & on a smaller scale, was concentrated.  Being then the extreme point of the Pacific railway the teamsters, freighters, & their hangers on, & those from the neighbourhood who join such gatherings, were all here collected together.  A town of wagon corals, & wooden houses was soon formed in this way containing about one thousand inhabitants, almost all men & almost all reckless & violent characters.  I asked a man who was himself","e4436a332d11ae5c27fe08e8e1110159.jpg"],[59096,"257\nconnected with the freighting business, & had been part of last winter at Julesburg, how things had gone on at the place; & how order had been maintained.  He said that at first no attempt at all was made to have things right, but that when it began to be known as a Hell upon Earth - almost every day two or three men being murdered or killed in rows - a few policemen were sent.  They did not, however, prove of the the slightest use for they were quite unable to arrest any body, or to hinder any thing.  If they had made the attempt, they wd have been shot as readily as anyone else.  When I was at the spot in February 1868 not a trace of the Julesburg of the previous year remained.  Every thing both houses & men had moved on to Shyenne.  A Prairie station on the Railway alone marked the place where the town had been.\nThe difference between last year & this year's headquarters of Rowdyism arises out of the better chance Shyenne has, as it is situated at the foot of the Mountains, of maintaining a permanent existence, & if so of rapidly becoming a flourishing place of business.  This has attracted to it a large number of storekeepers, who of course set up as soon as they were strong enought to do so, the reign of Vigilance Committees & Lynch Law.  In such places these are the means universally adopted for enforcing honesty & order.\nI reached Shyenne a little after dark.  Having been fully warned of the character of the place, I had taken the precaution of inquiring what were the names of the two least rowdy Hotels.  The moment","62d11db97edca070863a9c78a3b46c73.jpg"],[59097,"258\nthe train reached the Station I was off, bag in hand, for the first chance of a bedroom.  On my asking at the largest of the two for a room I might occupy alone, I was told they had no such accommodation.  I then went on to the other, where the same answer was given to the same inquiry.  I was determined not to take the chance of a night with a Shyenne desperado, so I again sallied forth in search of a lodging, this time however not knowing where to turn.  At last my house to house investigation brought me to a wooden structure on which were painted the words \"The Wyoming House.\"  It was far from an inviting looking place, having more the appearance of a drinking booth than of a place where one cd find a bed-room.  But as it was the only House I had seen (Hotels are here all called Houses) I thought the best thing I cd do, wd be to go to some tradesman, and take my chance of his telling me whether it wa, or was not, a safe place.  A Chemist, it appeared to me, wd be as little likely as any to be dependent on the Rowdies, so I entered the first shop of that kind I saw, to make the inquiry.  If I had looked in through the window first, I sd certainly have not opened the door.  For the first object that met my eyes was a [Rough?], lying on the ground in front of the stove.  His hair & beard appeared not to have been combed for months, & by his side was lying a gigantic mastiff.  At as it was too late to recede I turned to the Chemist, a youth apparently of less than twenty years of age, who was seated on the counter, & put","99f8c446b355f5726c3b7ed7b7972ac2.jpg"],[59098,"259\nmy inquiry to him.  \"Wall, Stranger,\" he said, taking his cigar from his mouth & speaking very deliberately, \"if it is a night where they have got no dance; for they give a dance twice a week to the Ladies & Gentlemen of the City; I calculate you may get through: but if it is a dancing night I calculate you will do better outside.\"  On looking in & finding that it was not a dancing night I applied for, & was shown to a bed room.  On entering, however, I observed that the lock of the door had been lately forced, for it was haning loose by a single nail.  In a house that admitted of such proceedings, I declined to take a room the door of which cd not be locked.  After making some difficulties, they showed me to another room.  On entering it I turned the key, & finding that it appeared to act properly, I told them it wd do, & took posession.  But on attempting to get the bolt of the lock into the door [port?}, I found that things were not so square, as that it cd be done in a moment, some violence having been used against this door also.  While I was \"fixing\" matters which I eventually succeeded in doing, I fancied I heard men & women gambling in the next room a great deal too distinctly, & on looking in that quarter I saw a considerable hole in the wall, which admitted of any one's observing from the next room what I was about.  This I stopped up with a Chicago newspaper I happened to have with me.  My last thought was to see whether the window which opened at the head of my bed had any fastening; & wheteh one cd escape through it in case of a fire; a matter that must always be attended to in these wooden towns.","a5b3d8ae3c57140d79b862a434b51d12.jpg"],[59099,"260\nI found that it opened into a back court-yard; that is had no fastening of any kind; & that one may [like?] open it from the outside with a single finger.  I did not like this, or anything that I had seen in the house, but as Judge Lynch had hung up two men in the main street of the town only a few nights before, I thought that all the good effect had probably not yet evaporated, & so was soon asleep.  The next morning, when I offered payment, the Landlord demurred accepting it [unclear}, & beckoning to one of his men sent him off to see if all was right.  On the man's returning, & giving him a nod, he took my money.  I asked what was the meaning of this.  \"Oh,\" he rplied, it is not the custom to settle accounts here, till you are sure that none of your blankets have been made away with in the night through the windows.\"  Blankets here are hard to get, & of some value for camping out.   / [See Clivan?]\nI passed part of another night at Shyenne on my return from the Mountains.  The coach reached the chief Hotel at the place at three o'clock in the morning.  I had expected at the hour to find things tolerably quiet; but on entering I had to pass first some people in a state of riotous drunkenness at the bar; then about twenty men sitting, or sleeping round the stove; & lastly a parcel of people playing & [unclear] at two billiard tables.  Beyond all these was the Clerks counter.  On entering my name & asking whether I cd have a room to myself, I was aprised that I cd.  \"Give me a receipt","d02b0225416abf1ac442aec2f47bdea6.jpg"],[59100,"261\nthen,\" I said for my bag & [rug?], & let me be shown to my room.\"  \"Is there any other passenger on board the Coach?\" the Clerk inquired.  I told him there was one.  He asked me to wait till he had come in, & then the boy - the new name for man-servant - wd only have to make one journey in showing us to our rooms.  I assented.  At last the other passenger came in, and the Clerk gave his instructions to the boy.  In doing this I observed that he only gave him one key, from which I instantly inferred that [I was done? twas done?], & was only to have after all a part of a room; but I decided to submit, for there were only three hours to be passed in bed, & my fellow passenger was a highly respectable store keeper of Denver; & if I had gone out of the Hotel, at that hour of the morning, with my luggage in my hands, all the rowdies about the billiard tables, the stove, & the bar, wd have known that I was going in search of a lodging, & some might perhaps have followed me out.  But on the boy's opening the door, & setting down the lamp, while he said \"Gentlement here is your apartment,\" I was no longer equal to the occasion; for now I saw, the possibility of which had never before crossed my mind, that I was expected to occupy the same bed with another man; & I gave vent to my indignation by observing \"that it was really too bad to be billeted off to half a bed, when I had been promised a room to myself.\"  \"As to the room to yourself,\" replied the boy, \"I know nothing about that, & the thing is [unclear]; but it is very unreasonable in you to complain about having half a bed, when it is a bed that is intended to hold three people.\"","db52c3088f13474b6f623bccf08f1129.jpg"],[59101,"262\nI asked my fellow-passenger not to regard it as any thing personal, that I was unable to occupy the same bed as himself, telling him that I wd lie down in my clothes.  Our first care, however, was to arrange what we sd do in case of fire, for part of the house we were in had been in flames only a few nights before.  In such a place sleep was impossible.  Our room was exactly over the kitchen, & the floor having been made originally of unseasoned wood, the heat had shrunk it, so that there were gaps everywhere.  Throught these came up all night from the kitchen the [efflusion?] of beefsteaks & onions which were being cooking incessantly for the gamblers, who wd themselves have kept any one awake with the noise they made, the chief part of it consisting of the most [imperious? ingenious?] & horrible oaths one ever heard, or will ever hear as swearing is everywhere else obsolete.  On coming down a little after six for the seven o'clock train, I found a few persons still drunk about the bar; & all the rest of those I had seen three hours before were now asleep on the floor, on chairs, or on the billiard tables.  These are persons who do not care for beds, or who wd rather spend the price of them in drinking, & gambling.\nI mentioned that, in my first night at Shyenne, I calculated on the effect two recent Lynch Law executions wd have in keeping things quiet for a season.  About that time I heard of five other executions of the same kind in that neighbourhood.","7794c498cf88f485d10e7b7961c12c8d.jpg"],[59102,"263\nThere are people who denounce this method of maintaining order but they do so without understanding the circumstances.  At all events a [unclear] has been known to exclaim loudly against it in New England, &, before he has been in the West a month, to join a Vigilance Committee. The fact is that the ordinary method of administering law is quite impracticable in a place where you can get no policemen, no constables, no lawyers, no juries, no gaols, no judges; & where, if it were possible to get the apparatus of Justice, it wd be near to impossible to work it.  Some are or other wd be bribed, or some flaw wd be established in the evidence, & there wd be time & opportunity enough, in one way or another, for the escape of the prisoner.  Instead of this here is a system which has no officers or jails, which costs nothing, & is very terrifying to evil doers by the rapidity & certainty with which it acts, & the mystery with which it is involved.  It wd be a very unnecessary & evil system in a settled community, but where none of the ordinary [appearances?] of law are possible, & where at the same time all the scum of the great world behind is concentrated, it is a recessity, & a highly beneficial one.  It does really what Napolean III claims to have done for France:  it saves society; which without it wd cease to exist; for it wd be overwhelmed by these reckless & desperate characters.  Every one in America knows how completely in California it got rid of all the disorderly & dangerous elements which were collected there in such force, that it wd have been quite hopeless to have attempted","c77d04401bb30101cd4b6888c81b5cf8.jpg"],[59103,"264\nto deal with them in any other way.  Just to [unclear] it was at Denver, a town on this side the Mountains, of eight thousand inhabitants, now as orderly & well [unclear] as any other eight thousand persons any where to be found.  Four or five years ago Denver was what Shyenne is now.  But Lynch Law has purified it, & in a way in which ordinary law has never purified any community in the world.  All the rogues, & violent fellows have been hanged, & & all the suspected have been made to clear out.  There are now no other such eight thousand souls in any part of the Old States.  A man who knows both wd rather leave his baggage out all night in the street at Denver than in any City of New England.  This is the state in which it is when Lynch Law hands it over to ordinary Law.\nBut Lynch Law is only half the system.  It is always accompanied by something else which I have heard described as \"the use of the pistol.\"  This has from the first been maintained in America long after Judge Lynch has retired from the scene.  It is still not unknown even in Washington & New York.  But in the ever advancing frontier of civilization it has all along been in active operation.  Every man in the West goes always armed.  And it is one of the most imperative of the laws of Western Society, that, if a man insults you in any way, you are bound then & there to shoot him dead.  Society requires you to do it; & if you do not, you will be shot yourself, for the man who","aa9d539df4f7f4c3cf79260b3c6768e7.jpg"],[59104,"265\nhas insulted you, supposing that you can only be waiting for an opportunity, will think it better to be beforehand with you.  This is their substitute for the old European law of duelling, which required that if a man insulted you, you sd give him a chance of shooting you also.  The Western plan is that you sd shoot him.  This enforced too by the same kind of social considerations, & attended by the same [immunities?], & its object is the same, to oblige men, at the peril of their lives, to behave themselves discreetly & politely.\n[nes?] The following incident was told me by a thoroughly credible eyewitness:  it will show how cheaply Society holds, in this part of the world, the lives of its troublesome members.  A dozen or more men were seated drinking, & smoking, & yarning in front of the bar of a Shyenne Hotel.  One of the troublesome chaps, in who Whiskey was just then overcoming discretion, took out his revolver, & flourishing it about, announced, that every one present had to acknowledge, that he was the finest fellow in the world.  Just as he said this two Gentlemen came in, & not knowing what was [passing?], walked up to the bar, close to where the swaggerer was seated.  This took off his attention from the rest of the company, for he now turned to the new comers, & pointing his pistol at the one nearest to him, told him to make the acknowledgement.  The Gentleman finding himself taken at a disadvantage, & thinking it most likely that if he put his hand behind him for his pistol, he sd, while doing so, be shot by the tipsy desperado, began to do as he was requested,","7bfc39c6b36cdfbd1136354a53a28d38.jpg"],[59105,"266 \n\"Well,\" he said, \"you are a [monstrous?] fine fellow:  I had no idea there were such fine fellows out here.\"  While he was saying this his companion took his own pistol from its sling behind him, putit to the swaggerer's head, & blew out his brains.  As the man fell to the ground, & he deliberately replaced his pistol, he said, by way not so much of explanation as of comment; \"that chap might have done some mischief.\"  Not another remark was made, or word spoken on the occasion.  These who wer in favour of order said nothing, as they approved of what had been done; while those who belonged to the troublesome class were also silent, because they thought it wiser not to show their colours.  When it suited the Manager's convenience he sent one of the boys of the Hotel to dig a hole in the Prairie for the corpse; & with that the matter ended.\nHaving breakfasted at six, I was out at the first dawn, & again, as I frequently did afterwards, saw the sun rise on the Prairie.  Till he was above the horizon, & it was full day, it was impossible to distinguish the Prairie from the sea.  The same effect is also at times during the day observable.  In the morning I even saw something like rippling waves on the surface, resulting I suppose from the was in which the level rays struck upon the little inequalities of the foot or two of haze that rested on the ground.  At a distance of forty or fifty miles the [showy? snowy?] range was already [unclear] with light, while","0a8485a09b7d9d065cbf4a55706c53ba.jpg"],[59106,"267\nThe lower intervening ranges were still black [unclear].  The aspects of human society as well as of outward nature are here so unlike any thing with which the English Traveller is familiar at home, that he is ever feeling conscious that new pictures are being added to the furniture of his mind.","cfebf28ef7490c34bbe904302b6b5fa0.jpg"],[59107,"Chapter XV   268\nWhilte I was waiting for the Denver Coach, & watching the changing scene, a German with whom I had had some conversation in the railway car for the two previous days, arrived at the Coach office.  We were both to start at the same time by stage, he for twelve hundred miles over the Mountains, I to [coach? coast?] along the Mountains to Denver, the point at which I proposed entering them.  On meeting him he held out his hand, saying, \"Well, I see we have both got safe through the night.  But, \" he added, \"I was prepared for them, if any one had meddled with me.  I had sixteen bullets ready\"  As he said this he drew aside his coat to show me his eight-shooting revolver hanging at his back, & then putting his hands into his breeches' pockets took from each a small four-shooter.  This gentleman told me that he was doing very well as a stock keeper in Oregon & Idaho.  That he had had Durham cattle driven, & carried by rail from New York to these Pacific States, more than three thousand miles, in which journey of course they had crossed the Prairies & the Rocky Mountains.  He knew all the Pacific coast well, having been in the States of California, Washington, or Oregon; in British Colombia & Sitka.  Of British Columbia he thought nothing ever cd be made, as there was no agricultural land in the Colony.  At Cariboo everything, even to flour, cost a dollar per pound.  The Indians about Sitka were the largest men he had ever seen, few were less than six feet in height, or two hundred pounds in weight.  I never met with one of this description of settlers who belonged to any branch of this Latin race: they are all AngloSaxons, Scandinavians, or Germans.","22c3f9d89683fd74cb2e4f4f47cc124a.jpg"],[59108,"269    33\nThe coach started at seven oclock with six fine horses. There was no postilion for the leaders, as was customary in our coaching days.  The Driver divided the reins between both hands, & off we started at a gallop.  Perhaps some of the [Sheyennese?] who witnessed our dashing departure wd not have been sorry to have left the place with us.  The Coach was full.  It was constructed (but without the befitting capacity) to carry nine persons inside & three outside.  Experience only can enable one to comprehend how much packing & squeezing, & [cashiering?] are required for arranging nine persons in a space barely sufficient for six.  You must imagine a coach, a size larger than our old stages, & when three persons have been jammed into the front, & as many into the back seat, a bench is let down from the side which reaches from door to door, & on this three more persons, to speak ironically, are accommodated.  Though it was mid-winter I sd have liked my neighbours all the better had they been a little further off.  What then must be the effects of such proximity on an American summer day, with the thermometer on the roof of the Coach at 120, & a cloud of Prairie dust pouring in at the windows?  If one of these western coaches, destined for its whole existence to work on the Plains & Mountains, & never to pass over a furlong of made road, could have been exhibited in London & Paris in '62 & '67, people on this side wd have been astonished at the strength of their springs, & of the whole of their construction","169fd5adfaeb153174f0b71f9625c7cf.jpg"],[59109,"270\nWe were full inside, & two of the outside places were occupied.  The party was composed of eight Gentlemen & three Ladies.  First came a good-humoured, jovial Colonel, the only Colonel I met in the United States, where I must have made the acquaintance of not far short of fifty Generals.  He had long been on the Indian frontier, & had conducted many an expedition against them.  His professional warfare being now over, he had taken to gold-mining & trading in the Mountains.  As he lived somewhere up on the Laramie plains he laid his accounts with having a few more brushes with his old dusky friends before the time came, not now far distant, when their name wd only stand for what once had been.  He was still in the prime of life, as every body is in the West.  He had one child; no body has more in the United States.  There was nothing characteristic in these particulars. Nor perhaps was there in his practice of carrying with him in his journeys a wickered magnun & two kegs of Whiskey.  Their contents were of different degrees of proof, & of different qualities, adapted to the different circumstances & the hours of the day. Strength was the special merit of the magnum, which was intended for after dinner use.  It was regarded as a liqueur, or stomachic.  The qualities of one keg made it suitable for the early part of the day; the qualities of the other fitted it for the evening.  But it did not appear that the Colonel carried about the magnum & two kegs for [in? is?] our especial benefit, for whenever we stopped","03930e7bb45cfbb7428edbadc5d8ba00.jpg"],[59110,"271\nfor a meal, & sometimes only when horses were changed, if the interval seemed a large one, the keg with the black hoops, or the key with the green hoops, or the magnum was taken from the boot, & every body near was invited to \"take a drink.\"  Even the man who was changing the horses was not omitted.  Cd it be that the Colonel was one of the proprietors of the Coach, & therefore desirous of making things as pleasant as possible to the passengers?  This cd not be the case for the names of Wells & Fargo, the great American coaching firm were on the pannels.  The true explanation I believe was that on the surface, that the Colonel had a heart as large as his head was strong; & that heaven itself wd be no heaven to him if he cd not share it with his friends; his friends being all those with whom at the moment he happened to be in contact.  There was another point, besides that of being content with the rank of Colonel, in which he was unlike his countrymen, & that was his English aversion to the inside of a coach.\n[Fox?]\nThe Colonel's wife acted as Cicerone of the country to the inside passengers.  She knew the name of all the conspicuous mountains, & how far off they were.  What accidents had ever happend on the route, & where there had been Indian fights, down to the one of last summer.\nNext in prominence came a Colorado herd-master, &","765ad4fe88b69952f3bd4cde1e8a5c76.jpg"],[59111,"272\nhis sister, whom he was taking from her home in Pennsylvania to keep house for him on the Plains, at a place called the Garden of the Gods.  Every one contributed what he cd to make the day pass agreeably & this Gentleman's contributions consisted in scraps of poetry, & little high flown speeches suggested by the sights & occurrences of the moment.\nThere was also a Lady who had made seventeen voyages across the Atlantic & Pacific, (I suppose with her husband) & was now returning from a visit to her relatives in the State of New York.  He husband was the owner of a mine in the Mountains.  Whenever called upon she was ready with a story.\nThe seat next to her was occupied by a well-informed & Gentlemanly man.  He was a Philadelphian & had graduated at some American university.  I collected that he was going to the Mountains to look after some mines in which he was interested.\nTwo Denver store-keepers (but as town is here [construed?] into city, so is storekeeper into Merchant) completed our party.  Their forte was that style of humour which is known as American.

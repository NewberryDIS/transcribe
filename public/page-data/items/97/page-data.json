We met Annie at the Depot this morning and she wants us to go with her home. Will you tell the girls not to expect us till they see us.  Uncle is going to Boonville this afternoon and I send this with him. We rode home with him this noon and took dinner there. Have not been to Mary's yet. Uncle is coming back Saturday morning and cannot stop at Remsen. If father wants to see him he must be at the depot Sat. Morning.\nJennie.","b11bdcda44330d6e7a921f52319e454f.jpg"],[24413,"South Headley, Nov. 20 '49\nDear Henry:\nImagine if you can, that you see me in my little room, seated by my table sighing for a letter. Three long weeks have passed since I have heard one word from any of my brothers or sisters. This is the fourth letter I have written since news from home has blessed my lonely heart. I write regularly every tuesday evening and I should not wonder if you could guess almost every time when to expect a letter from me. When we formed our society for letter writing I thought it was so arranged that we should each one get one letter every week, if it is not so, tell me in your next, so that I shall not again expect to hear when no letter is due to me. I never felt as though I had so few friends as I now feel that I have. I feel all the time as though I were in the midst of strangers. There are so many here that it is impossible to get acquainted. Every meal the tables are set for 210 persons. It seems like quite a village all in one family. Next week is thanksgiving and many of the young ladies are going home, we shall have a vacation of four days for the accomodation of such. I cannot spend it with you but if you write me some letters, I will place the likenesses that I brought with me around me and (although so many faces will be wanting) try to imagine myself really surrounded by those I love. I expect we shall have quite a pleasant day at the seminary. I have written no where but home since I have been here I hope next week to find  time to write to others. Tell Mary Thomas that then she shall hear from me.","497d447fa42b29e69c3e4c3a0e80a88f.jpg"],[24414,"Last week a young lady drownd herself in the mill-dam of this place. She was attending school at the Academy, she had not been very well during the day and desired to be excused from school. Her friends hearing nothing from her for three days became alarmed and after much search her body was found in the dam. It is supposed that the blood rushing to her brain deranged her and she threw herself into the water without knowing what she did.\nYesterday and today have been very rainy. I washed yesterday and my clothes are out in the rain. It is very gloomy here when it rains, every thing seems to weep. There the clock strikes 10 and I must hasten or I shall be tardy in retiring, good night.\nWednesday morn.\nThis morning as I was sleeping in my quiet room dreaming of absent friends I was startled by my room-mate coming in into the room and exclaiming \"Oh! you will be tardy.\" \"I expect the bell to ring every moment.\" I had hardly opened my eyes before I was on the floor. I am now in the middle class. I do not know whether I shall be so classed in the catalogue or not. I shall try to do my best to have it so. My time is so much taken up that I cannot stop to think, as I suppose you have thought while reading this almost senceless letter.\n(We walk a mile every day when it does not rain. It seems a long way and I am pretty tired by the time I have walked a mile and back. When I get home I shall be such a walker that I shall think nothing of walking to the village and back before breakfast, or to Utica between breakfast and dinner. Has father got a new span of horses yet? If he has not, tell him I think it would be cheaper for him to send his children here to school and he would soon have no need of any. We have very beautiful sunsets here. The sun sinks in all its golden grandure behind Mt. Tom's lofty head. I must close or this will be too late for the","6349aa048b828857b605890ac6cf8290.jpg"],[24415,"mail. Dont fail to write when it is your time. If I dont hear I shall think Sarah is very much worse or some of the others are sick. If you do not write soon, please to go to the village to meet me for I shall probably be there. If you have moved I wish you would send your post-office address so that I may no longer write in vain. When have you heard from Elizabeth? how is she? How does my little nephew prosper? Does mother have any help? how is father's and mother's health now? How long does Mary think of staying with Elizabeth? Is John at home now? Does Sarah sit up any? I have two extra lessons to day which make me more in haste than usual so you must excuse the shortness of this letter. I enjoy myself pretty well. My health is very good. Love to father and mother and all brothers and sisters. Dont forget you have a sister in Mt. Holyoke nor fail to write.\nyours in haste Jane Ever[hole caused by seal]\nP.S. Remember I am not three hundred miles from home and you need not pay more than five cents on a letter. I received one from Mary on which you had paid ten . Dont forget to direct Jane Everett.

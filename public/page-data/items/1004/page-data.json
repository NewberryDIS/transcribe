In a very limited number of cases, probably six or eight in all, we have received orders through other parties for the payment of animals (ponies mostly) in favor of Indians; but in each, and every case, to Indians known to be friendly, and only upon special order of the Commander of the Post, or of the Indian Agent.","0446f1710d60a7a9195d900c591b7bac.jpg"],[65833,"For evidence of the above statement and in vindication of our course, we most respectfully solicit a thorough investigation of the charges preferred against us; felling confidence in our ability, not only to refute the same, but also in being able to prove to your satisfaction that these charges are brought against us by parties who are anxious to have us removed from the reservation, from purely selfish and interested motives.\n    We submit the following statement also in regard to our status as traders on this Reservation.  We hold a permit granted by General Sheridan when in command of the Department, authorizing J. G. Evans, and R. M. West to trade at this Post; being informed that an additional license would be essential we immediately secured the same from the Agent for permission to trade with the Indians under his jurisdiction on the Reservation, and forwarded the license with such endorsements as we supposed were required by the laws, in the premises, to the Commissioners of Indian Affairs, at Washington, for his approval.  After considerable delay the license was returned fro some slight informality, we at once corrected, and returned the license to the Commissioners","263e71459dcf4209ba29999132570401.jpg"],[65834,"when it was again returned, owing to our sureties having omitted the proper certificate of their solvency.\n\n       We have secured a third license from Agent Tatum, which with a voluntary letter of recommendation from himself to Superintendent Hoag, and our bond with Robert Campbell, and Messrs.

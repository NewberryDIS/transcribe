Met a number of our friends there who gave us all sorts of little dinner parties and then we would have them up to our place and make them eat potatoes with a spoon, drink out of tin cups, wash their own dishes etc. as our household supply was very scant, but we enjoyed it so much more than if we had rows of silver and cut glass. But oh best of all was the week we spent with the peasants, the dear simple souls, we all hated to part from each other.

We've been having such long journeys, getting up at five and six in the morning and giving matinees on arrival, that we are quite tired out and will be thankful to stay in a city longer than a day. \nThanksgiving, while you were at the foot ball game, we were in the theatre. It was a beautiful day in De Moines also, though rather cold. Dinner at a typical country hotel, but everything tasted good even if the cups were without handles and we couldn't eat the nuts because there weren't any nut crackers. \nBut you stop at all sorts of places on one night stands.

It was like a masquerade, only we were all so cold and hungry, and the theatre was old and poorly built.\nIt is the only way to be thankful for what we have, and to have an ambition and aim in life, otherwise one would drift off into nothingness and have nothing to work for.

From the present aspect of affairs I judge that it will be by all deemed necessary to have the Agency and the military post situated near together, if they do no even soo become one and the same thing.        General Sheridan and General Hazen seem to agree that the two must near one another, and in the selection of the locality, the former wishes in the establishment of the post, to accommodate the Indian interests, while the latter desires to locate the Agency so as not to incommode the troops.    Both rather seem to incline to the Valley of the Washita River Valley [strike].  I regret this as [strike] and feel certain that they would change their minds were they to examine the country as carefully as I have done.     I spent several weeks last summer in visiting the [strike] all parts of the Comanche and Kiowa Reserve except the uninviting North Western portion, with a view to intelligently deciding upon the best point for the new post, having the Indian question my own [strike] mind at the same time.  I have now as [strike] reviewed the subject giving it close attention for several days, and my opinions on the [2 word strike] have not changed.","5d37ddf4c9ab79494e137bc1f5ed57fd.jpg"],[66628,"2.\n\n    There is not in my own mind the slightest doubt that the best location for both the Post and the Agency is at the junction of Medicine Bluff Creek with Cache Creek at the Eastern base of the Witchita Mountains, about seven miles E. by S. from Mount Scott.  So confident do I feel that time will prove every interest of the government to be best conserved by the selection of that locality for the establishment of both Agency and Post, that I venture to give you my reasons for this belief.\n    Looking first to the selection of a point for building a frontier post for purely military purposes.  I used this language in my official report dated July 14, 1868, forwarded to Department Head Quarters after my careful examination of this whole section of country:\n    \" I am decidedly of the opinion that for the purpose of controlling the Indian tribes inclined to be lawless and troublesome, of preventing the marauding parties now so often visiting North Western Texas, and of protecting the Chickasaw and Seminole borders, and the peaceable tribes still farther West, who are endeavoring to fulfill their obligations to the government from molestation by the wild bands, a new post, to be garrisoned by cavalry, should be at once established West of Fort Arbuckle * * * I gave particular attention to the selection of the best location for such a station * * * At a point eight (8) miles North and seventy (70) miles West from Fort Arbuckle the most practicable route being about seventy-five (75) miles.  I found what I consider on the whole, the best location for a military post in the South Western portion of this Territory.","afd5b90383eefde7ba682278add4e96f.jpg"],[66629,"3.\n\n   \"It is a tract of high level prairie land containing about two hundred acres, situated just as the base of the range of hills which are the Eastern extremity of the Witchita Mountains.  Mount Scott, the highest peak of the Witchita chain is seven or eight miles West by North:  a perpendicular cliff of Trap rock known by all the Indians as The Medicine Bluff is a mile and a half in the same direction: immediately West of the plateau and fifteen feet lower than it are three or four hundred acres of level prairie land.  The Northern boundary of the plateau is a beautiful, pure stream of good size running in a deep pebbly bed from springs in the mountains North and West of Mount Scott, just a the foot of the cliff mentioned and called Medicine Bluff Creek.   In passing the plateau, the stream joins the main Cache Creek and that there flows at the North-east and East sides there being between the high ground and the Creek at the East, a meadow of two or three hundred acres fully thirty feet lower but dry, never overflowed and of remarkable fertility.   To the South traversed only by ravines dry water courses and Cache Creek with its branches, the high prairie extends to the Red River.\n    \"The water of the creek than which none could be more pure and healthy, is abundant for the men and animals of a large command.  There are besides, within a short distance, a number of five never failing springs, some having strong mineral properties from coal, iron, salts, &c.\n    \"Timber suitable for building purposes is not at all abundant anywhere in the south-western portion of the Territory, but there is more oak of","21324b72611b91cc1daf31e12ecb4c20.jpg"],[66630,"4.\n\"different kinds, cottonwood, walnut, pecan, ash, elm, hackberry mulberry and china upon the Cache Creek and its branches than anywhere else.  Excellent stone for building of several varieties, and in unlimited quantity, can be easily quarried within  a short distance.     Good limestone is also abundant.     The grazing in this section surpasses anything I ever saw.  The varieties of grass are numerous and among them are the buffalo mesquite and gramma grasses, all abundant and especially nutritious.      Buffalo, cattle and horses graze here the year round keeping in excellent condition.   While old Fort Cobb was garrisoned all the hay used there, was cut at [strike 2 words] made here and hauled almost forty miles to that post.     The climate is delightful and cannot be otherwise than healthy.      I examined the country well in all directions and found no standing water or moist bottom all is high and dry.      This is the locality of which General Marcy in his work \"Army Life on the Border\" (page 12) says,     \"It commands an extensive view of the country to the North, South and East.  From its commanding position it is well secured against surprise and is by nature one of the most defensible places I have seen.\"\n\n    \"I believe that a force of four or six companies of cavalry at this point would be more effective than if stationed in any other locality I have visited and would give security at the same time to Northern Texas, the Chickasaw, the Caddos, Witchitas and other friendly Indians who in this Territory","688a372b3396fdb3803dbd6f5e08fc03.jpg"],[66631,"5.\n\"are endeavoring to remain quiet and peaceable as all points where trouble is likely to occur can readily be reached by mounted troops placed here.\"\n\n         A good supply route is of course an important consideration in the establishment of a post dependent upon distant depots.  On this subject I wrote in my report her [strike] above mentioned.\n         \"Believing that before very long all the troops in this District can be used to better advantage at stations beyond the present Western boundaries of the Cherokee, Creek, Seminole and Chictasaw \"Nations\" I desired to ascertain the practicability of opening a supply route from Fort Riley to Fort Harker nearby direct to the eastern point of the Witchita Mountains.      The information in regard to this subject which I derived from frontiersmen, traders and Indians leaves little doubt in my mind that an excellent road can be made with very little labor from Mount Scott to Fort Riley, bearing East to cross the Washita below Fort Cobb [strike from to cross to Fort Cobb] to avoid the Salt Plains and cross the Arkansas near the mouth of the Little Arkansas.  It might be necessary on account of the length of the route and to look out for the Indians in the neighborhood of the Salt Plains, to have a post in the Territory near the Southern line of Kansas.     I shall endeavor by hereafter personally visiting that section to enable myself to give still more definite information regarding the matter.\".\n          I find that General Sheridan and Gen'l. Hazen agree with me as to the expediency of such a route, and propose to soon put it [strike 2 words]","fff41c099e20e3186bf46ec957f2ee90.jpg"],[66632,"6.\nopen it from Fort Riley for the transportation of both Ind [strike] Army and Indian supplies.   The only protection needed on this route will be the post which will have to be established on the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Reserve, with the Agency for those tribes.\n\n       My reasons for believing the location described to be the best for the Military Post, being thus fully given, I add what seem to me to be equally good reasons for erecting the Agency and locating the Comanches, Kiowas and Apaches in the same vicinity.\n       The Treaty concluded with those tribes, every portion of which relating to the obligations of the Government to be [2 word strike] should be strictly adhered to, if the Indians are held to the same, expressly provides that the necessary buildings for a permanent Agency for them, shall be as near as possible to the geographical centre of their reservation, being convenient to wood and water.     The point I recommend is as near as any to the centre of the said Reserve, has near it the best wood, water, grass and arable land in that Reserve and is in every way adapted to the wants of the Government Agents and the Indians themselves.\n        Locate the Agency in that vicinity, gather the Indians around it as the centre of what must become a settlement, place a force of cavalry at a military post established near the Agency, and it would be next to impossible for a marauding party to reach the boundaries of their Reserve without being overtaken by troops properly handled.","9203d42ae347c51b078545e7f056f22c.jpg"],[66633,"7.\n\n    On the other hand, no point in the Washita Valley, the location suggested can be selected which has either good water or grass, and which is not at the extreme Northern boundary of the Reservation.    For the wood and water, the Indians, who would of course being near their Agency, would [strike] have to camp immediately upon the line of their [strike ir] Washita, the Southern bank being their Reserve while the Northern would be forbidden ground.  Under such circumstances the stock of the Indians would daily be crossing such a stream as the Washita, the Indians would necessarily follow them, some would for one reason or another be such [strike] sure to move to this side of the river, and the Northern line of their reservation becoming a paper [underline] line only, the most important provision of the Treaty would be constantly violated by the one party with the tacit consent of the other.  At the same time there would be some Indians, very likely the most unmanageable ones, sure to locate themselves around the mountains because of the abundance of gaming [strike] game and the superiority of the grazing during most of the year, and being a full [strike] day's march South from the Washita, the agency and post, they could pass East or South almost with impunity.\n    The Indians themselves, especially the Comanches, dislike the Washita, have remained in the Valley during the past year only because kept here by their Agent and are anxious to locate in the valleys of Cache Creek and its branches.

Kearney and since that the road has been infested with stealing bands of Indians to such an extent that nothing but the utmost vigilence could could prevent the stealing of stock.\n    On last Sunday morning, I received the news from xxxxx Fort Sedgwick or rather from Ft. Mitchell that Indians were on the road below and that a train of Mr. Korstz had lost all its animals.  In an hour or two after I started Capt. Ball with his company in pursuit.  Capt. B. had to swim the Platte and go fifty miles before he could get to the trail, but he followed it quite a long","dbba513e52d6dbd852cea4d748983ee6.jpg"],[68965,"distance beyond the White river before giving up all hopes of overtaking them.  Capt. Ball thinks the Indians have at least ninety- miles the start of him, and he considered it perfectly useless to pursue any further.  He returned late yesterday.\n\n    Yesterday morning I heard of a party of seventy Indians some fifteen miles above here, and Col. Green with all the remaining serviceable horses at the Post was sent after the.  I have no news from him as yet but I have heard that the friendly Indians near here have been stripped of nearly all their horses.\n    In the midst of these troubles the desertion [underline] fever broke out in the Command. Several small parties went off and as it was all important that this mania for desertion should be checked I sent several parties with Commissioned officers in pursuit.  Two of these parties have been successful in bringing back a port of the men.  In this connection I will state that I have made repeated efforts to have a General Court Martial ordered here for the trial of our General prisoners without success.  We have men in the Guard house who have been there for months","de42de0946ea0a5f42b1fd504f834a9b.jpg"],[68966,"awaiting trial.  We have had plenty of officers here for a Court at any time until now, and the whole business could have been finished up in a few hours.  Major Litchfiled telegraphed to me {illegible]  that the matter of the Court would be attended to but I fear it has been forgotten.\n\n       I enclose with this a sketch of the new [underline] road from her to Fort Reno & Kearney.  For some unaccountable cause the road heretofore has passed beyond Bridgers Ferry, up the Platte through the bad lands to near the mouth of Gap Creek before turning northward.  Now I am almost certain that the new road which I have ordered opened direct from the Ferry to Reno, will be a great deal better and some thirty to thirty-five miles shorter.  As I stated in my telegram of a day or two since, would not the garrison of Fort Casper be of some service then, at or near the Ferry an on the main road to Montana?   I know that Gen.  Messall Template:? has always inclined to Deer Creek but only for the reason that it was on the line of the telegraph.  I think myself that a guard and station for Telegraph should be","80662e4c1e3be97140e5ad24b8f4f99d.jpg"],[68973,"Fort Laramie, May 15th 1867\nMy dear General\n\n                                I am sorry to say that Capt. Dewers did not explain the direct road from Bridger's Ferry to Reno.  He was directed to return that way and Nick Janiss, a good guide was sent up to guide the party back.  Capt. Dewers states that he did start back that way but owing to loss of a food portion of his mules and the difficulty of breaking the road with weak teams he was obliged to return to the old road after coming a few miles on the new one.\n         The report concerning the loss of Dewer's mules will be prepared by Sun.  I didn't think Even will get caught that way.  He has good hobbles for all his animals and I procured for him about a third of a mile of telegraph wire to be used in wiring up the Camp.  If he can stretch it so as to catch and capsize a few of the Indians, the Medicine will be something that will make them very careful of running about our Camps.\n                                                         You probably","a43ab45b65eb6f61401f6d13ececfef7.jpg"],[68974,"saw that the going up to Phil. Kearney was a bitter piill [strike] pill to the Commissioners.  I think it very doubtful if any one of them would have consented to go if you had not sent me the despatch urging it so strongly.  Kinney has interests up there and he is finally concluded to go.\n\n                  The arrival of the Commission and a good portion of the hostile Chiefs coming down to see them may change the face of Indian Matters somewhat, for we will perhaps soon have them down about here.  It is rather a curious condition of affairs attempted. Generals Buford and Iavhorn, with Beauvois and the Secretary will probably remain here for some time. promised to remain thirty-five days, I think, when they invited the Indians to come in to see them.  They are made very comfortable here and I do everyting they require to be done for them.  They appear to be very remarkable men, and they may be able to accomplish some good.  I very much doubt it however.  Hancocks affair in Kansas has stampeded all the so called friendly Indians north, and I would not be surprised to see all the Cheyennes on the war path.  I consider the Cheyennes","8610b204f92eb660f8a9a19cd6599ca8.jpg"],[68975,"the best of all the Indians with whom we must deal, and I have thought that Hancock was a little hasty.\n\n                                        I saw today an official report concerning an Spencer Cartridges.  I was surprised to find such a worthless lot.  Our men have become so fearful of losing their eyes by the use of them that it will not do to attempt to use the ammunition at all.  One man was very severely injured this morning and I fear he will lose an eye.  Two officers were lost hors de service yesterday.  The whole lot of cartridges will have to be condemned.  The old kind (Smith & Wesson) is good, but we have but a few boxes on hand.\n                                                            Very Sincerely Yours\n                                                                              [illegible signature]\n\nGenl C.

Your note shows me that my mention of Dr. C. was quite unnecessary, and I acknowledge it cheerfully.\n\n                                              Very Respectfully\n                                                Your friend and Servant\n                                                       R. de Trobriand","ccc8253cd372a52dd4361928296a3e8e.jpg"],[69066,"2\nand travled all over the Country looking for both the Secretary of War is Satisfied that I had men and horse but he Says I must Show that I was emploied by you and that I might onley be working for the Reward offered I posted up for government the first bills ever printed offering a Reward I allways come to you and aney time you Sed go and do aneything I don't my claime for this is but three hundred dollars I was note over three weeks and five men and horses I paid all Expences the days I got the gun boat baker \nboat baker got Booth So I did not go in it but I had the men in the Street all night awaiting orders and the news came that baker had got him if you remember I was hard at work at that time I comenced the next day after the President was kiled if you recolect you went down about 9 oclock in the morning and brought the Presadent up from tenth Street in a waggon you give me orders to take men and do all i could I did as you told me to but all the orders for horses has not your name to them but you gave orders and took them to the partis then thay give me orders to Quartermasters of corce your name is not an my last orders and the Secatary Says he will wite you he Says that you think I mad a good deal of money if it was my dying word I Say that I Lost Mosby owes me over a thousand dollars his men owe me Lots of tobaco I was in thare power I had to trust them when unley made the laide on Washington thay Stole Everything I had I then give up my teame and if you recolect when Genl Sheridan made for the valley you Sent for me to come to your office you told me if I would take the Team and go oute you would se that\nI was paid I was Loosen then I took my wife and Comenced agan now I mad but ninteen trips and I\nCould not make a Large amount of money but I did actuley Looose money but if Mosby and his men had of paid me I should made maby two thousand dollars but I did not get the tobaco In and if Mosby had got me oute agan he would of hung me all he wanted was the Large lot of goods he ordered and to hand me but I did not go not go anney more the Jews put in affadavits that I decived them that thay thought I was a Settler did thay think our Soldiers wore gray uniforms and rebbell buttons Shoo Fly they Say I asked for bribes if I had of  don that I ges you would of put me in old capitol thay I robed if I had don the Leas thing roung would not Mosley or his men hung me in a Second what a foolish Letter this of Riddles is but he has killed my Claime in the Sennate I have no friend to help me aboute a hundred Jews have him to the Committee I will now ask and pray that you will wright the facts and youse your influance for me to get a Settlement with the Secretary of War I am poor I hav a little farm in Ellington NY five hundred miles from Washington I hav bin hear Six times this winter and Spring I Shall go home tomorrow if cost me about a hundred dollars every time I come I had to Sell two cows to get the money to come hear this time and my farm my little home will be Sold in September to pay the mortgage if I do not get aney money hear I think that government had aught to Sustain me and to pay me that bribe money or its Equivilent and never let the Jews hav it It has cost me every cent if I got it for Expencis I paid all the Expences of the trails getting wittnesses of Millatory Commission and traveling Expencis my family expencis in Washington don all the work and paid oute thousands of dollars","b240d714b6a331e917b7938710c341b1.jpg"],[69067,"and it is not a Shame that after all the chances of Life all the abuce I have suffered and the nights I have traveled with my wife in the Rebbell Lines Expecting any day to be Shot and all this to aide the government and now after I have Exausted the last dollar and today my familey is Suffering for the money paide out for the interest of the government and I am now over fifty years old am I to become a begger for my Loyalty this is hard Cant you make a statement to Secretary of War that he can have some grounds which he can make a Settlement with me fix the amount for all I will be Satisfied with your Report to tak what you Say.

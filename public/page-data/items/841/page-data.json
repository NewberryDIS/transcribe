His actions at Ja  burgh? and unclear is a disgrace to the Regiment and those that serve with it.

I positively will not serve under such a man and desire you to assist me in being mustered out in case the Consolidated portion is to be left under his supervision.\n\n    I presume you have had a detailed account of his outrageous actions while enroute for Kearny, as Lt. Thompson I understand was with him.  His actions while inebriated at Laramie were of the most disgraceful Case for an officer.\n   I will be down as quick as I can possibly get there.  My orders require me to report to Lt. Col Baumer at Kearny.

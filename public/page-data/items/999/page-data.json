I concluded to stop over to-day & will go on towards the Guadalupe Mountains, via Castle Gap, to-morrow.  Was out to-day six or eight miles in that direction & found the road-way that far, all I could wish for. Lieut Hodges was with me.

I am inclined to think that the Indians moved south towards the Rio Grande.  If we have nothing more of these Indians between this & morning, it is probable that Capt. Keys will accompany me as far as Castle Gap taking with him a small detachment of his Company.\n                   This Spring is a great success.

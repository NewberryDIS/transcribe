It is the first attempt ever made to publish a paper in this vast land of Alaska The Times will be devoted to local and general news. We shall when we deem it jeracticable? discuss all questions and public interest, touching the affairs about Alaska. In politics and religion the Times will be neutral. The Pacific Rail Road we are in favor of, and would like it to hear the screams of its whisle echo from the peaks of Alaska, and the musical strain of humanity shouting a Chorus of ? Let the iron horse speed along with its precious burden of emigration. \nWe are strongly in favor of a Civil Government and directly opposed to military rulecrossed out s?.

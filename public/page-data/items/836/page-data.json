General  U. S. Grant,\nCommanding the Armies of the U.S.\nHead Quarters City Point.               \nGeneral,\nI was exceedingly gratified by the receipt of your letter of the 8th of January cautioning me concerning the movements of Dr. Gwin, and giving me contingent instructions with reference to any hostile movements he may cause to be undertaken against the U.S. from the Mexican State of Sonora.\nI have taken the deepest interest in this scratched out Mexican question ever since England and Spain withdrew from the invasion of Mexico and it became evident the french were continuing it for other than the ostensible object for which was sent on foot.\n[lined out] Whilst I was in Washington, and before the Emperor Napolen's letter to General [since Marshal] Foreys appeared, I had a conversation with the french minister with whom I was on friendly terms, and in it I charged the french government with having the intention","fcc280ec251038bcac7a12a8006c685b.jpg"],[54674,"[lined out] to seize on Mexico as they had on Algeria and to make it as they had that country a dependency of the french Empire\nHe warmly disclaimed for his country and government any such policy!\nSince coming here I have received from Mr. Seward some notes from Paris showing for what purpose it was understood there Dr. Gwyne was sent to Mexico.\nThe war in the east has forced, and is forcing, numbers of persons inimical to us into my Department, And the fortunate result of the last election, and the little hope the ? have of a future here is making them turn their attention to Mexico as a place of refuge.  I beleive this is also the case with those from the extreme southwestern states and Texas, as I hear of persons coming over from Texas into Chihuahua and thence to Senora.\n[lined out] Sinora and some of the other Northern Mexican states seem to be the favored\nI heard of bands of persons? inimical to us in having assembled in Senora\nIt was not long since [lined out - it was published in] the [lined out - papers] democratic pens of this city stated that two ?","1c4d26f2e48e2fdd971d4413da8d3cda.jpg"],[54675,"persons were here as agents of Dr. Gwin and invited people desirous of going to Mexico to apply to them for information [lined out - and a full account of the objects the Doctor had in view] to them for information.\n[lined out - I called on both to answer]\nI required each [lined out - of the persons named] to state whether this was, or not, true.  One, in effect, admitted it - The other, Mr. Ridge denied it and called on me in person to account for his presence in this country.  He said he was an englishman representing British capitalists and being largely interested in Mexico, was deeply concerned in whatever related to that country and in this way came to know Dr. Gwin both in Paris and in Mexico, and had freely conferred with him in both places.  Mr. Ridge's object in coming to Mexico was to obtain a concession to light the city with gas, and one to build a Rail Road to the Pacific\nHe showed me letters confirming his statement.  He is a remarkably intelligent man of fine presence, and he impressed me favorably [lined out - as well? as to his candor and as well as to his ab] as being [lined out - a] straightforward and truthful [lined out - man]!\nHe said it was a question, when he was in Paris, how Maximilian was to support his court, government and army and at the same time repay Napoleon the expenses incurred by France in the invasions and conquest of the country!  The latter decided the former must have the reserve from the ? ? and he would look to be reimbursed from the resources of the Northern States!  which Dr. Gwin had","d461e608e0e1360db29d7d5145ef9d83.jpg"],[54676,"represented as great.\nNapoleon asked the Doctor if those resources could soon be rendered available!  The latter? answered that by drawing there among anglo ? ? emigrants from any and every quarter a reserve of millions might be had in a short time! - The Dr. was asked [lined out - if he would] to undertake the enterprise, which he consented to do and was now carrying it on -\n[lined out] You have, perhaps, seen it stated that the northern Mexican states have been secretly transferred to the french as an endemnity for the expenses of the conquest - to be held, either till those expenses have been refunded or - and it comes about to the same thing - to be permantly assigned them as their fortune of the spoils!\nI think [lined out - It seems to me] if the french wanted only a superintending? mining engineer, or administrator, of finances, they would have sent a frenchman, for their conceit of themselves as miners and administrative agents is great - and if they wanted a mere director of Anglo American emigration, and wanted an American they would have been apt to choose one [lined out - an American] from that section of the country[lined out - having the greatest and population and] known to have [lined out - all the] the greatest enterprise! and largest population!\n[lined out - I am] It therefore seems to me [lined out - of the french] that it is precisely because of Dr. Gwin's known","13ed142cd74e7b0d9a8f91620615d44b.jpg"],[54677,"connection with the rebels and secessionists and especially with these from this state that caused him to be chosen, as [lined out - thereby he would being] being the person best suited to attract [lined out - a population of] an emigration of [lined out - rebels] our enemies [lined out - to the] and to plant [lined out - close to] upon our frontier a people hostile to our institutions our influence, and our progress\nSuch a supposition is in direct accordance with the principles announced by Napoleon in his letter to General Forey, in which he speaks of staying the [lined out - inf] progress [lined out - of the U.S.] and [lined out - checking the] influence of the U.S. over the continent!\nThis desire of putting a negative on the U.S. is no doubt combined with [lined out - an intention] the intent to affect something [lined out - perm] positive for france by obtaining as he did sarry? and niece? as his recompense for interfering in Italy - a province for himself from Mexico.\nI have looked upon the whole scheme of Dr. Gwin as hostile to us, and upon him as an enemy - [lined out - and have therefore issued an order] and shall therefore do whatever I can that will tend to thwart it and him - [lined out - prevent his receiving any encouragement and or comfort that I can I have notified the ? before the receipt of your letter I have ordered that no] Before the receipt of your letter I had ordered that no one should embark for Mexico without a permit, and that this permit [lined out - shall] should only be given to [lined out - persons] loyal persons going on some legitimate business, and that no","a49396fe6155d980582dc6475b3c63c0.jpg"],[54678,"agent [lined out - or representative] of Dr. Gwin [lined out - will] should be suffered to remain in this Department.\nI have assigned an excellent officer Brig Genl. Mason? to the command in Arizona, and have provided him with a sufficient force to watch the frontiers [lined out - as well as check the inroads of the hostile indians]\nThis country is alive to this whole question and the people would respond instantly to any call upon them [lined out - in favor of] to meet an aggression upon our Mexican frontier!\nI am assembling a small reserve of two or three regiments at this place as a nucleus for a force to provide for any contingency.\nI feel strong enough on land for all enemies either domestic or foreign, but [lined out - I beg to call attention] in view of possible - may I not say probable [lined out - if not imminent] hostilities [lined out - with] to the south of us I beg to call attention to the state of our fleet on this coast.  I do not pretend to speak of my own knowledge or with any precision ever from what has been told me - yet enough has been said to warrant my feeling that on the ocean we are by no means in [lined out - the] a desirable condition [lined out - we should be.]\nThe only vessel in this port is a double ender gunboat and a small vessel acting as revenue cutter and a monitor for harbor defence.  From the statements, of naval officers who speak as if they knew","a26d010129a21eed80a7886be9888bc3.jpg"],[54679,"[the whole fleet on the coast is [lined out - in every respect] quite inferior to that of those who may become the antagonists! \nThe desert South of Ft.

I want to say I did what I thought was my duty. I have read so many different works on or about the modoc war of 1872 & 73. the books I read was so disgusting I must say that the authors of some of the books certainly was never in the neighborhood of the lava beds. they must have dreament of the modoc war.\nI see in Capt William T Drannans book where he wrote about the modoc war. according what he says he captured and killed more modoc warriors than Capt Jack really had, when he commenced fighting. Jack only had fifty two warriors in all. I knew every one of them. it is such men as Mr Drannan who miss lead the public in regard to Indian wars. Mr Drannan certainly was not any where near the Lava bed the time of the modoc war of 1872 & 73 as I do not remember of meeting him at that time.\nin my work I aim to give both sides of the Troubles of the Modoc Indians and the whites. the Indian side has never been give to the public yet. I have one draw back I have no education.  but I have tried to write as plain as I could I use no fine language in my writing for I lack education.\nJeff C Riddle","a71d1fe62435ebb1be5f15838ba21dbf.jpg"],[62457,"chapter 1 captain Jacks father and his people at home in the Tule Lake and lost river country\nchapt 2 captain Jacks father call council Indians all attend Cumbutwaush-peninsula Indians also attend Legugyakes Chief ready to move against white-people.

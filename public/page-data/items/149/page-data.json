Nov. 15th 1881.\nMiss Jennie Everett.\nDear Friend: \nYours received and \nshould have been answered sooner.\nIn that the Bourgeois bought for \n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin?\" If it is, the \ntype is over 25 years old; but\ntype used on hand presses and\nused carefully as material on the\n\"Cenhadwr\" were used, will last\nmany years longer than on power\npresses. New Bourgeois is worth\nhere about 40 cents per lb. - yours\nI think, ought to bring about 1/2. \nOld metal is worth only 10 to 12 1/2 cents per lb. \nI was glad to hear that Mr. Davies \nhad purchased the Cenhadwr. It ought","376953521ac13229f4fcc20fe2e11413.jpg"],[34833,"to be kept in Oneida Co. Association\nWe returned from our\nvisit Sept. 8th jut about 6 weeks\nfrom home. Had a very pleasant\njourney.

We were glad\nto see an old friend from Steuben. \nWe hope Sarah is better - tell\nher, we expect to see her out here\nnext summer, - we can make\nup in large city and prairie, where\nwe lack in hills. \nGive our love to her and Annie\nalso Mrs. L.

Mr. Davies wrote me in regard to the purchase of the \"Cenhadwr.\" Some, he said, advised him to have it published in an office, same as the \"Cyfanill?.\" I advised him by all means to buy the whole office and control the workmen, as the cheapest in the long run. By adding a few modern Job Fonts he could get considerable work outside, and as work into a good business. I thought of the Bourgeois, and that you had no use for it, suggested that he print the first form in that type, and make as few changes in its appearance as possible. The material is old and would bring but little in any other way. I think Mr. D is the one to take hold of the \"Cenhadwr.\"","d97c7c0df142af447ef4cc9255893b4a.jpg"],[34835,"Remsen Nov. 8, 1887\nDear Friend Jennie\nYour letter was received a long time ago, we were so glad to hear from you and unclear you were feeling better.

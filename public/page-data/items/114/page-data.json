But I stayed in the room sometime after that, and she did not say anything more, nor speak to me again.\n\n    She seems to have a good deal of vitality yet, and unless a change comes I should not expect her to drop away just yet.

So I will write a few words more. Yes, Smith Center is in the Northern tier of counties, on the Rock Island and is the County seat of Smith County?. It is a very pleasant place of about 1300 people. There are five churches here, the Presbyterian Methodist, Baptist, \"Christian\" or Disciples, and our own.\nI forgot to mention in my","5664e70c59c0d5a81430653e63bc4332.jpg"],[28042,"2\nletter of today a word about the condition of my back: - by which you may judge that it is not occupying a very large place in my attention. It is practically well again. I am not troubled with it at all now.\nI hope that your election passed off satisfactorily on Tuesday, and that the town went \"dry.\" I guess the women folks cannot vote on the question, as they can do at our city elections in Kansas. Here in Kansas, we try to get out the ladies, and we carry out temperance tickets in this way. I shall be glad to learn how it came out.\nLovingly Yours\nJ.E.

I am so busy all the time and tired that I am afraid I am a little discouraged. My sickness came on me in Topeka on my way home and I got wet & c. and got home sick & tired and had to get into the work at once and the weather has been terribly warm. Yesterday our hot spell was broken by a cold rain and today is cold enough for a stove.

The children are enjoying their school work I think pretty well. Edward is doing nicely but yet is not talking so very much plainer. Now in my busy time I think of the nice visit we had with you and rests I would have on the corner of the hair sofa. J.E a week ago sunday by request gave a talk on our trip East and he did it very well and it was enjoyed by all.

The folks are all at CE meeting but little Mary and I will take her to Church with me in a few minutes. Cousin Mary Lewis gave me an envelope the day we were there for Edward & Mary as a little gift for them. We got Edward a little desk in Topeka which he enjoys very much it has two shelves for his books underneath the desk part. He has it up in his room & he goes up and writes his lesson after school. Mary we got a chair for her one that is large enough for the larger ones to use and she is also very proud of this.

Perhaps you will be as prompt in answering mine as I am in answering yours. -\nThank you for your suggestion that you might possibly help us on our Eastern trip this summer. But I would not want you to do that at all, Indeed I would not feel right to have you do so, and would not want to accept anything from you","bbe84ae63778299457a7123dffb11de4.jpg"],[28074,"in this way. Do you succeed in keeping your money well invested? That is what counts and makes for thrift. I think there might be investments made out here on real estate at 6%.

Kansas is about the best place, in every way in the world, and all is secure.\nWe cannot yet quite make up our minds about taking that journey East.

We are in some perplexity about leaving Roberts with Zaidee.

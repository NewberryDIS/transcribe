How glad I would be to meet you this morning & feel the impress of your dear lips upon my own & to exchange with you the warm greetings of affection & to learn from your own lips all about yourself & our dear children. I sometimes almost wish I was not such a home body as I am, for when I am away from wife & children I always so long for their presence that I am almost homesick.

I do, dear wife, so long to make you happy that when I know you are not satisfied with our home it causes great pain.  Were it in my power I would have you live in some place where you would be satisfied.  So my health now is I cannot attend to business & consequently I could not support my family in town.  The little business I am now attending to, in which I have no pecuriary interest makes me so nervous that I cannot get to sleep before 11:12 & 1 o'clock at night.  Our home on the prairie will become more & more attractive every year, & I do hope it will become to you, home, the dearest spot on Earth.  I will try & make it as comfortable & pleasant as I can, & as fast as we can without involving ourselves we will improve it.  Let us then, dear one, thank God that we have as good a home as we have & especially let us thank him for our mutual love, & for the buds, blossoms & fruits of that love as manifested in our own dear children, for it was his providence that first made us acquainted & united us as husband & wife & He has from our united & combined souls & bodies made our children & stamped upon them the impress of","d72dbc6dba4a9571a24416577cf3440c.jpg"],[39895,"him to rally again.

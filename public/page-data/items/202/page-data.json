Others may\nbe included but these should not be left out.\nWe come then at once to the specification of some\nof the more Evident demands for such a class and for\nsuch a course. And first: the teacher demands it.\nTo but few unclear S.S.

We conceive that the Mon. Class.\nEnthusiast is to the teacher what a theological\ncourse is to the pastor. But at present it is looked upon\nby the many very much as a Theological course\nwas regarded years ago. If a man was\ncalled to preach he could preach whether\nhe understood theology or not, in fact in\nmany minds it stood almost as an axiom. That the less he knew about\ntheology the better he could preach, provided\nonly he could talk loud and cry well.\nThe main requisite for good S.S. teaching in the\ncommon mind is that the person be a \ngood warm hearted Christian - Piety is everything.\nBut we need not repeat\nthis old mistake. Piety and intelligence are not\nincompatible. We cannot deceive the child of the 19th\nCentury. He come to the Sunday School teacher \ntrained under the discipline of the Secular Schools, and able\nto read a disciplined mind, and the teacher needs\nnot only intelligence to go with piety, but a\ndisciplined intelligence, tested, proved, and","d2d23b4384ffa94939e72f6dac892d81.jpg"],[45611,"When some one complained to Ronland Hill\nof the blunders in speech of one of his plain\npreachers.

Perhaps the one thing we need\nto preach, and teach, and talk, and every where insist\nupon today is - Discipline. This is an Educated\nage, or as Dr. J.M. Gregory puts it -\nit is a \"teaching age\". \"The world wants facts.\nIt cares little for what any body thinks. We want\nthings proven in Science and Theology alike.\"\nIf any one needs facts it is the Sunday School\nteacher. When men have work to do in any\ndepartment of activity, they want a basis\nof truth, facts, realities, for their corner stones.\nMighty formative influences are at work on\nevery hand. Secular Education is not plodding,\nit is speeding its way - Religion, which unclear\nit its original unclear must not now yield the track\nand go plodding on behind. The religious\nteacher must have drill akin to not\nof the Secular teacher. Every argument for\nNormal training in the day School","29987a35a3a04d5a5fa04af009ff842b.jpg"],[45618,"5\napplies with augmented force to the Sunday\nSchool.

The whole being 7th Scholar must be drawn\nand held by the attractive of the truth itself\nand the manner of its presentation. This requires Superior teaching ability.\nThen the S.S. teacher is subjected to the\nmost rigid scrutiny on the part of his schooling\nby way of Contrast. The standard and\nappliances of the day school are now so\nperfect that the S.S. must elevate its\nstandard if it would maintain its power.\nChildren measure their teachers by comparison.\nSincerity and Earnestness do not compensate\nfor well meaning ignorance or other incompeteracy in the mind\nof the Child.

On the other hand\nthe secular training secured under such\ncircumstances is also defective. A true Education\nneeds ever the quickening power of\nreligious teaching. Now when ever a divorce\nactually takes place between these two agencies,\nmaterialism must be the result. How can","96eef6a5ad2e91cb4c28fac02acac187.jpg"],[45624,"7\nthis be prevented and the right moral training secured?\nNot by insisting upon the retention of the Bible in the Schools but\nby raising up an \nagency analogous to the public schools,\none equally as potent - \"one that will\nmake the moral and religious instruction\nas prominent and specific as the secular\nis in our public schools.\" The Sunday\nchool is that agency. Make it as efficient\nas it is capable of becoming and we need\nnothing better. Trained men and women\nmust do this work. Again look at the unclear\nof the work. If it is Evident that special\ntraining is required for this work, where\nshall we look to find the adequate number\nto prosecute it? Pastors cannot do it for\nthe masses must be reached. They may guide\nthe work but that is all. A host must be\ntrained to meet a host.\nBut in advocating this special agency we\nare asked the question. Do we not have\nTeachers meetings, Institutes,","88e6cd2a358ea0cb21f6ed80587529eb.jpg"],[45628,"8\nConventions, and lay Colleges, and what are these for\nif they are not for this very purpose? The\nquestion is legitimate and the distinction\nshould be drawn. The Teachers meeting\nhas its important mission to fill. \nIts work is Specific & has special reference in the work \nof the coming Sabbath and the routine work of the School\nand ought neither to be supplanted by the Normal \nclass, nor to undertake the work\nof the Normal Class, \"The least possible\nTeachers meeting we ever knew \"Says\nDr. Vincent, failed to become an effective\ntraining school for teachers. Business\nto be transacted, specific lessons to the\nprepared, and a certain amount of devotional\nservice to be engaged in, render the pursuit\nof a regular course of training impractical.\"\nThe Institute approximates more nearly\nto what is required, but fails through its\ntransient character. Held at long \nintervals, and continuing but for a day or\ntwo its efficiency for training is almost\nwholly inadequate. Besides the teachers that","6e421e9faad82902f587c96b0508e397.jpg"],[45630,"9\nneed most the instruction are the very ones\nwho usually stay at home. The Institute has\nhad, and still has its place. It is the\nforerunner of a more permanent institution.\nIt will continue to be in demand at least until\nit is supplanted by a normal class\nin every Church. The Convention is of a different cast & will\never be needed as a means for the\nmutual encouragement & strength of S.S. workers.\nThe Seminary or lay College as a popular\nmeans for the training of teachers is too\nExpensive and requires too much time\nto suit the circumstances of the unclear\nof teachers. There is but one conclusion\nthen to which we can come. If you require\nso much at the teachers hands, if you exalt\nthis work to a profession, you must give\nhim the facilities for proper preparation, \nand those facilities can no where be supplied\nas well as in the Pastor's Normal Class -","ba34b56ae643010e086fb7c6e2563a51.jpg"],[45633,"need most the instruction are the ones who\nusually stay at home. The Institute has\nhad its place. It is the forerunner of\na more permanent institution, the Pastors\nNormal Class. It still has a place and\nwill continue to be in demand until every Church\nhas equipped itself with a better substitute.\nHe X'd out the whole paragraph","3c23d283b10b3d0b14cb18152ba00641.jpg"],[45636,"10\nIn the second place the School demands it.\nThe conflict of to-day rages around the\nchild. Who shall have him? is the question.\nThe Sunday School lifts its plea. \nThe child is in danger. The funds you give us\nare not equal to those that stand against\nus.\" Infidelity is specious & brazen & seems well posted. It understands \nits own tactics. The child is held by us at a \ndisadvantage. We say the Bible is from God, but\nwe can not prove it. How few of our\nteachers understands the grounds on which\nthe divine authority of the Bible rests and are\nable to give them when Gods word is called in\nquestion. This is not all that makes up this\ndisadvantage. One of the arts of the devil\nis to engraft error upon the truth or to\npervert it. The world is full of false doctrine.\nIndoctrination, is thus made a prominent\nfeature of the S.S. teachers work. But\nnothing is more neglected. Here seems to be an\naversion to it. And perhaps for two reasons.\n1st. \"The doctrine do not stand out clear in\nthe teachers mind. It is hard to teach what\none do not know. 2nd. The religious pendulum","d2961c05dacf351e720d4d38804a1a4f.jpg"],[45639,"11\nhas swung up in to the extreme of false liberality\nOld time theology is scouted. Creeds are scattered\nto the minds - It is popular to decry doctrine.\nThere is little stability of belief, doubt is running\nrampant. The Sunday School Coming\nin direct contrast with these things and held responsible for their defeat has a\nright to demand that its teachers be thoroughly\nequipped in order to successfully meet them.\n= But the school demands the existence of a\nNormal Class for another reason - That it\nmay have a high standard of attainment.\nIt is impossible to lift the child above your\nown level. Like teacher, like pupil.\nThe whole School will take its position according to\nthe Standard Set before\nit. If the standard is below the school,\nthe school will drop down to it. If it is above\nthe School, the school will rise up to it.\nThe Normal Class Exalts the word of God by\nmaking it worthy of the highest attainment. Many \na child has no doubt come to despise the Bible","9cf6364de01d87e6fe580fd4dae520af.jpg"],[45642,"12\nbecause it has been apparently treated as\ninsignificant through the neglect of\ncareful study on the part of teachers.

You \nmust make people believe that your S.S.\nwork is more than Child's play if your would\nenlist their sympathises and Save their Souls.\nIt is not the poor and the ignorant, and the\nhalf mitted alone that we are trying to save. It\nis as well the world of intelligent, thinking\nmen & women. An intelligent Scholarly - cultured\nminister draws a congregation of like characteristics,\nand vice versa. And so it is\nin Sunday School work. You shall catch the\nkind of fish you bait for.","9db9d283c42563c745149db4962bc698.jpg"],[45644,"13\nOnce more, it holds a large reserve force\nof teaching talent to be used at a moments\ncall. One of the most perplexing questions\nthat has ever agitated the minds of S.S. workers is\nhow to supply the school with proper teachers,\nespecially in times of Emergency. In the Normal\nClass the question is answered. Every member\nholds himself in readiness to fill broken\nranks or to be drafted for permanent\nservice as the school Enlarges its boundaries.\nSo classes are saved from seathering, the\ninterest is kept from declining, and the whole\nwork of the school is carried steadily on.","8e9ae05b426cfa761ff1013a221fa38c.jpg"],[45646,"14\nIn the third place the pastor demands it.\nThe question as to who Shall lead the Normal\nClass presents in difficulty to my mind.\nI should say with Emphasis the leader properly belongs\nto the pastor. It should ever be the pastors\nNormal Class. The reasons for this are\nobvious. 1st The pastor is supposed to have\nhad that peculiar training himself which\nfits him for the work of training others.\nHe has passed over nearly the same ground in\nCollege and Seminary which his class will\ntriverse. No others in his Cong. are suppose to\nbe so welll adapted then to this work as he.\n2nd The pastors work is more\nthat of Superintending than of doing the\nwork itself. The Bible holds him responsible as\nan \"overseer\". The work done by the church \nhe must account for, if done well it stands\nto his credit, if done ill he is responsible\nfor it. Through the Normal Class he can guide the\nwhole teaching of the School he can hold in his\nhand the reins of all its interests.\nBut the pastor demands the Normal Class","47e47145389dd794eb017c9ec27dc950.jpg"],[45649,"because it enables him to bring to light the\nteaching office which the Bible clearly enjoins\nupon every minister of the Gospel. While\nJesus said \"Go ye into all the world and\npreach the gospel to every creature,\" He also said\n\"Go and teach all nations.\" The minister is\na teacher as well as a preacher. But the teaching\noffice in its true sense has been to the\nministry a \"lost art\" for centuries. The \nhistory of the Catienmentate System reveals the\nplace and power of this sphere of labor\nin the Early Church. If I am not a false\nprophet the time is not for distant where our\npresent preaching system will be modified\nso us to include more of the teaching or \nCatechising method. And when that\ntime comes there will be ten-fold more\nhonor in the pulpit, and a corresponding\nincrease of intelligence and efficiency among\nthe people. (Str. Gibsons Lectures)\nThe pastor demands it as it enables him to call\nout and develop the talent teaching power\nof his church. Some philosopher has discovered","5dec8e16687007d9b1cb32ae74047ac2.jpg"],[45651,"16\nThat there is latent power enough in a single\ndrop of water if it could be rightly utilised\nto shake the world, whether this be true or not. \nThere is latent teaching power\nin our churches sufficient if it could be\nbrought out, developed and put to use\nto man more than double the work we are\ndoing to day. And who can do this work\nbetter than the pastor? Whose duty is it if it\nis not his? Who needs trained associates\nmore than he? And how can he better\nsecure them than through just such an agency\nas the Nor. Class? Did not Paul anticipate the need of some such\ninstrumentality when he said to Timothy, \"The things that thou\nhast heard of me by many witnesses the same\ncommit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach\nothers also.\" \nBesides the pastor labors under the high\nresponsibility of presenting every soul under\nhis care perfect before God. How is he to\nfulfill this requirement? By constant contact\nwith the individuals that compose the masses. \nThink you? This would be impossible. Is it not rather\nthrough the few whom he has gathered around\nhim and perfected in the way of the Lord and\nby them to reach and perfect others? Let me ask\nand answer one other question before & close this\npoint. What is one of the Efficient Causes of","1da129fb26cb5237418842148d80d2e2.jpg"],[45653,"17\ninstability in the pastoral relations at the present\ntime. Is it not because pastors are too content\nto stand alone and Enjoy the honor\nof doing all the work of the churches themselves and\nconsequently subject to receive all the blame\nif it does not go right? Would it not contribute\nlargely to the permanency of the pastorate\nif each pastor were to rally around him from\nthe first a few of his best workers and inbed\nhimself in their hearts by training them and\nfitting them to be his co-workers to carry out\nhis plans and do the work of detail which\nso many times not only burden but help\nto weaken the pastor? They are his marshals\nboth for his defence and for attack.\nThe relations of the pastor to the Sunday School\nare very easily determined in the light of a\nNormal Class. His duty would not be to \nSuperintend the school, nor to teach a class, nor\nin any way to interfere with the Management\nof the School. There would be no friction between\nhim and any officer of the school. His work\nis done in the Normal Class, Save that of gathering","66be9456ce4bd7e24dfd003277d61c3d.jpg"],[45655,"18\nup the fruit of the School or serving in the Capacity of\na pastor. The Superintendent would be left to\ncarry out the details of the work in his own\nway, and to come into direct contact with his teachers in\nsuperintending the special preparation \nof every lesson in the teachers\nmeeting privilege & a power wh. no Supt. can afford to lose.\nIn the light of this discussion\nit is not then a mere question of privilege\nor choice as to whether a pastor has a Normal \nClass but one of duty. We have not stopped\nto consider its practicality. It has been\nsufficiently tested already to settle that\nquestion beyond a doubt. If a pastor can\nsustain a Sunday School he can a Nor. Class.\nIf he can keep alive a prayer meeting he\ncan by application and thoroughness keeping alive a Nor. Class. It is a question of no \nordinary interest or movement. We must keep unclear\nwith the rapid current of ideas or we shall lose\nground for God. The time to grasp these means\nto like these advanced positions is now.","db154630cf6566317dae46be3db9b937.jpg"],[45657,"19\nIII But in the third place we are met with\nperhaps the most difficult question of all, and\nthat is, How can the Nor. Class be successfully\nconducted? The question cannot be answered\nfully. Every pastor must be his own Engineer.\nHe cannot work in another man's harness, at\nleast without gauging it to his own capacities,\nand the Circumstances of his Class & Church. Only a\nfew things in general may be specified. There\nis nothing more certain than that any pastor can,\nif he will make a Success of this work.\nThis will not depend upon a \ngreat number. When Dr. Chalmers gave his lectures\non the \"History of Speculative Philosophy of the 19th Century,\nhe remarked that if he could only interest four\nout of 200 Students who heard his lectures he\nfelt assured that their influence would tell on\nall the rest: If you can get but two or three\nof your teachers to see the necessity for this kind\nof drill, and interested in the Study it will\nprove contagious and soon others will be added.\nThe time for meeting is important. It cannot as\nwell be sanwitched in or tacked on to some","00dda7c4c594f345687c2067e6327f8a.jpg"],[45659,"20\nother meeting. It ought to be dignified by having\nthe best time as it occupies\nthe first place in all Sabbath School teaching.\nRemove it out of its place and you impair its power, if you do not kill it.\nIt must live for force of its dignity. I know\nthe great difficulty is a multiplication of appointments.\nBut the S.S. teacher must be taught\nto give more than the dribblings of time to the unclear.\nBut if for any good reason a separate evening\nis overtaxing then let it be joined with\nthe teachers meeting, but give it an adequate\nportion of time, and the best place in the\norder of the exercises. Begin and close in\nthe minute. The place is important,\nThe ideal would call for a room of its own. Where it\ncan be sure of undisturbed quiet. And can\ncenter all its interests. The Nor. Class would be permanent institution. A room to be called\nthe Normal Class Room would ass much to\nthe permanency of the class, and be the nucleus\nof an over increasing power. The library, the\ncabinet of specimens, Maps, charts, and all \nnecessary equipment would help to gather interest\nat that spot.","2923ec6d6397e67fa1ae66c387d0b048.jpg"],[45661,"21\nThe text book is an all important matter\nto be considered. Shall we have one or not?\nWe answer, by all means, and for the following\namong other reasons: In the first place\nno pastor can afford the time to prepare\na course of lectures such as the Normal Class\nwould require. In the Second place, if he\nhad the time it is not every man who is\nable to mark out and elaborate a Course\nof this kind. This work belongs to those who\nhave given these things special attention.\nIn the third place, the teachers require something\nmore adapted to their circumstances.\nSomething that they can carry with them,\nto use at odd moments, something as a basis\nfor their memory, and for constant reference.\nAnd in the fourth place, every argument in\nfavor of a text book in the public School\napplies to the Normal Class. The fundamental\nidea of the Class is discipline. True discipline\nrequires for its basis clear and well ordered\nideas. These the text book is supposed to furnish.\nJust such a book as this is the Normal Class","86f79dc55e5343a39bb9698f9d1f1562.jpg"],[45663,"22\nManual Published by our Pub-Soc - and the manual outlines\nPub by the Methodists.\nWith the time and place designated, and\nsupplied with a text book we enter\nupon the work. The following are some of the things\nto be borne in mind in the Management of\nthe class. It is a voluntary Society, no compulsion\nbrings them there; all grades are represented,\nthe old and the young, the educated and the\nuneducated, the disciplined and the undisciplined,\nthose who are quick to apprehend truth and those\nwho are not, the timid and the bold. Here,\nthen, is an opportunity to exercise tact, and\nuse variety, and this must be done.\nSome suggestions may here be in order: The \nstandard of this class must be something more\nthan the mere reading over and being able to\ncomprehend the subject matter of the text books.\nThe postulate of the leader from first to last Sh'd be","aeb16b5e9aa9c539775f9982b9607d11.jpg"],[45666,"23\nand this refers to himself as well as to his teaches.\nThis book must be mastered. Consequently\nwhen it starts out with the proposition,\nthe Bible is from God. it is expected that, that\nproposition will be verified without reference\nto the text book. We cannot always carry\na text book with us. The character of our\nEnemy needs a more ready weapon. Knowledge\nstoned up and the ability to impart it\nwith effect and at my time is the thing necessary.\nAgain, Willingness to expose ignorance should be\nanother primary rule of the Class. We should\nnot come together to display our knowledge,\nbut to find out where we lack and then\nto fill up the vacuum.\n(This was marked out below)\n[By reference to the Manual it will be readily\nseen that it presents but a bare outline of\nthe subjects it considers.

The preacher is\nthe public man, the orator - the pastor\nis the private teacher, counsellor and guide.\nThe Early Apostolic method is described\nin the Acts as follows: \"And daily in the\ntemple and in Every house, they\nceased not to teach and preach\nJesus Christ.\" And later on Paul\ngives his plan of work in his address\nto the Elders of Ephesus. \"I kept back\nnothing that was profitable unto you\nbut have showed you, and have\ntaught you publicly, and from\nhouse to house,\" and adds his Estimate of the practical\nsuccess of his method. \"Wherefore I\ntake you to record this day that I am\npure from the blood of all men.\"","4a4d93f0c54405361452c4ce7b8f7973.jpg"],[45825,"2\nThis \"house to house\" work recognises\nthe value and necessity of personal contact\nof individual effort as Supplementary\nto the public and more ground work\nof the Minister.

So that the\nminister is often Satisfied if only\nhe succeeds in gaining the reputation\nof being a fine Speaker and of\ndrawing the crowds. Where this\nimpression prevails the distinctive\nwork of the pastor must inevitably Suffer.\nProbably, growing out of the Seemingly\npopular demand for intellectual greatness\nin the pulpit, is the impression that\npastoral work is at best incidental\nand is beneath the dignity of a great\npreacher and so should be relegated\nto the assistant pastor or to the\nchurch missionary. A Short time\nsince a western Clergyman wrote to\nthat prince of preachers and pastors\nDr. Theodore L.

Some may consider\nthemselves better fitted by nature to be\npreachers than pastors and so are\nled unconsciously to neglect the\npastoral work, and vice versa.\nI think the history of the ministry\ngoes to Show that the most useful\npastors have not been those who have\ngained great reputations as preachers\nor pastors distinctively, but those\nwho have united the two characters in\njust proportions, and degrees. Such\nwas Payson at Portland ME., Baxter at Kidderminister,\nChalmers in Glasgow, and E.J. Goodspeed whose\npastorate of the Second Baptist Church,\nChicago was as much of an ideal\npastorate as any that could be\nmentioned Since the days of the Apostles.\nA Church built up under his leadership \nfrom 250 to above 1200.

And yet E.J. GoodSpeed was not\na great preacher. He was much\nmore than that, he was a preacher -\npastor. Would God that more of us\nwere like unto him, and more of\nour churches were of that sort.\nDr. Shedd puts it clearly by Saying that\n\"The learning and Study of the preacher,\nare needed to Enlighten and guide\nthe zeal & Earnestness of the pastor; and the vitality\nand directness of the pastor, an needed\nto animate and enforce the culture of\nthe preacher.\"\nThe Specific advantages to the pastor\nof going among the people are\ngenerally understood and may\nbe summoned up as follows: It Enables\nthe pastor to recognise his people when\nhe meets them, to know their peculiarities,\nto discover their spiritual wants, to\ncomfort the bereaved and sorrowing,\nto become acquainted with the Children\nof the households, to get a hold upon\nthe hearts of the people, and to\nconverse with the unconverted","a6ccba44f3a103dbe0726915acb58d61.jpg"],[45837,"8\nand inquiring ones. Such\nadvantages the pastor must have\nin order to preach well, and to\npreach well is to meet the spiritual wants of\nthe people, not to amuse them nor\nto amaze them. Dr Cuyler Says, \"The prime\nmerit of good gunnery is to hit the\nmark.\"\nThere are however, abuses growing\nout of this work which justify Some\nattention. A miscellaneous and aimless\nhouse to house going must be strongly\ncondemned. Mr. Spurgeon who is\nwell known as one who does not\nunderrate the value of practical\nwork among the people speaks very Suspiciously\nabout this kind of So called pastoral\nwork. He says, \"I don't know about\ngoing from house to house visiting.\nSome put it down as a duty for all\nChristian Ministers to visit - to be\nalways visiting. I have not observed\nanything miraculously good about\nthe preaching of brethren who spend\ntheir time in that particular department.","f716657dfa4ade9107470529cd996689.jpg"],[45839,"9\nEither the brother wears out altogether\nor else you hear that he has preached\na sermon a third time within two\nyears, which is rather a close shave.\nWith all the force of my being I do say\nwhatever you do not do, keep your\npreaching up to the mark. You can do\nmuch better by a thoroughly good Sermon\nthan by dropping in here and there\nand taking a little chit-chat. By all\nmeans keep the Sermons up. The pulpit\nis the very Thermopylae of this war.\nHold the pulpit!\" What he says here\nabout the relative importance of\nthe pulpit is unusually just, but no\nless so than is his condemnation\nof the chit-chat Style of pastoral\nvisitation and what is equally as\nbad, if not worse is the habit of having\ncertain \"running-in-places, \"lounging\"\nplaces, and such like, where the \nministerial character is lost so that of the\ngossip and by which distinctions are\nmade and prejudice and jealousy\nEnsue.","0ccef37392e6da0e2b0521185029c006.jpg"],[45841,"10\nThere are some advantages and\nsome disadvantages in connection\nwith the adoption of a rigid\nSystem in doing pastoral work. It\ndepends largely upon what the System\ninvolves. Most pastors find it \nnecessary to divide up their time between\nmuch valuable time be frittered away,\nand one kind of work be made to\nencroach upon another. Such a\ndivision of time is both a Spur\nand a limit to the inclinations\nof the pastor. If he is naturally given\nmore to his books than to pastoral\nwork, he is limited by his division\nof time to certain hours. If he is\ndisinclined to study and more\nnaturally given to outside work he\nis Spurred on by the System he has\nadopted to use his time in a\nlegitimate way. Doubtless certain\nafternoons in each week should be\ndesignated for visiting, and these \nshould come as near the middle of","5882b996625de274093c7c32da07d4e0.jpg"],[45843,"11\nthe week as possible. But if the System\nadopted arbitrarily calls\nfor a certain amount of work to be\ndone within a given time, there is\nsuspicion at least of its impracticability.\nFor instance, Some text books on \npastoral work lay down the rule that the\npastor should undertake to pass\naround his entire parish at least\nonce each year. This may be\npossible or impossible according\nto the Size of the Membership. On the\nSupposition that it is a possible thing\nto do, it is doubtful if the results\nof such work are profitable\neither to the pastor or to the people.\nTo say the least about such a System, there is a\ntendency toward a mechanical and\nperfunctory manner of doing a most\nsacred work. It would seem like\nSweeping through his allotted field\ndoing up his work, as it were, \"by the\njob\", without much respect to character\nor circumstances. On the other hand,\nsuch kind of visiting engenders a","9353056fd6eb8f2a0bfd2c95185825eb.jpg"],[45845,"12\nvery unhealthy and disagreeable demand\non the part of the people to expect a\nvisit from the pastor once in so\nlong a time whether there is any \noccasion for it or not. Many a good\nChurch has been Spoiled by the\ndevelopment of Such an ungenerous\ndemand upon the time of the pastor\nand many a pastor for the want of\nmoral courage to connect the obnoxious\ncustom has failed in his\npulpit ministrations or has found\na premature grave in a vain\neffort to meet its claims. If the\nSystem adopted requires of the pastor\nto make visits only where there is a\nSpecific want to be met his work\nwill be very much simplyfied and\nmuch valuable time and strength\nwill be saved. For all such specific\nwork he may set apart Certain days\nwith the assurance that in the ordinary\npastorate he will find enough to do\nto consume all the time he has at\nhis disposal.","2a1336466fbcdc5c4139d6acb07ed1d1.jpg"],[45847,"13\nThis prepares the way for a more definite\ndescription of the model pastoral visit.\nThe pastor of this church does not assume\nto know just what that perfect ideal\nis, nor does he feel himself compliant\nto live up to it should it be revealed\nto him. Every minister however, has an\nideal, or at least, is supposed to have.\nMy Effort in the following description\nwill be simply to give an ideal founded\nupon general principles with which others\nmay have constructed for themselves\nfrom the positions taken already in this Sermon.\n1. And first a model pastoral visit\nshould always have\na specific aim. According to this,\nit should never be said that he\nhas called simply for the sake of\ncalling, or to meet an abnormal\ndemand on the part of the people,\nor to accomplish so much work within a given time.\nIt shuts out all miscellaneous,\ngossippy chit-chat visits. The Minister\nknows before he enters a house just\nwhat he is going there for, and whom","766d6e7158ef099aa44038489ff9731e.jpg"],[45848,"14\nhe wishes to see. His errand is so\ndefinite that he is at no loss as to\nhow to introduce his subject, and\nloses no time in getting at work.\nEmbarrassment and awkwardness\ndo not appear while he proceeds\nat once to deliver his message or\nto accomplish his purpose.\nThe objects to be aimed at and the\noccasions requiring the pastors\npresence outside of his pulpit\nare so many and varied as\nto leave him in no doubt as to\nwhat his duty is, or where\nto go to find it. In most pastorates\nEspecially in the cities there is the \nconstant presence of Strangers in the\nCongregation whose acquaintance\nthe pastor should promptly make\nand to whom a cordial welcome\nshould be Extended. He goes at\nfirst for this purpose alone. It is a\npastoral visit. There are many\npeople in Every Community who\ndo not attend worship in any Church","f1b8ed50c1ddf2470583309ac93601ba.jpg"],[45850,"15\nThey constitute missionary ground. The\npastor goes to invite them to his church\nand the children to his Sunday School.\nHe may not read and pray with them\nat first, but it is a pastoral call.\nAnd so he goes to the bedside of the\nsick, to the house of mourning, to the\nhousehold of trouble, to the individual\ninquirer, to the careless Sinner,\nto the worldling and backslider,\nto the mother for a conference as to \nhow to save her boy from the snares\nof the devil, and her girl from the\nvicious facinations of society life\nand lead them both to Christ,\nto the wife as to how to redeem\nher husband from the Curse of\ndrink, to the homes of the poor\nbearing food and raiment, and\nto Christians families for a season\nof devotion at a time when all\ncan be present. And these are but\na few of the Specific errands upon\nwhich the pastor may go among his\npeople engaging his true and energy","eb5ceb11ad01d6c77b924edcdd7eaacf.jpg"],[45852,"16\n2. The ultimate object of the model\nvisit should be a spiritual result.\nThe call may not always bear, directly\nupon this,\nbut such a result should never be\nlost sight of by the pastor. Such \na motive and purpose in his heart\nwill give character to all he may Say\nand impressions will be left which\nunder the wonder working Spirit of\nGod will ripen eventually into\nSpiritual fruitage. Whenever it is\npracticable the direct method\nof approach on religious subjects\nshould of course, be used, but it\nis not necessarily true that a visit\nthat does not involve the reading of\nthe Scriptures and prayer, or a\ndirect address to the individual\nupon the Subject of personal Salvation,\nis not a pastoral visit. \"Wisdom\nin winning Souls\", being all things to\nall men implies a variety of\nconditions, which require a variety\nof spiritual tactics. The visit should\nnever be made an End to itself. If it","5826a99edd6cb71ced1757d7d23c3f7f.jpg"],[45855,"17\nis a call for the purpose of acquaintance\nit should not be for aquaintance\nsake alone but to gain Knowledge\nand personal influence to use in\nMinistering Souls to Christ. The \ncircumstances must determine just what\nthe process shall be in each case -\nAnd this leads naturally to another\ncharacteristic.\n3. The ideal visit should be adapted\nto existing conditions. Zeal should\nnever outrun judgment. Common\nsense is a prime quality in determining\nthe fitness of things. The successful\npastor has a discriminating perception\nof propriety. The practice of Some\nministers to that of going from house\nto house, introducing themselves and\ntheir subject in a manner partaking\nof rudeness, and with an air akin\nto a demanding the privilege of praying\nwith a family, whether they desire it\nor not, much to their annoyance by\ninterrupting domestic duties. How is your soul? It is\nrecorded of Dr. Payson that on one","d9f98f1c6097c38864917c47b8451435.jpg"],[45857,"18\noccasion when called to solemnise\na marriage in a family where\nhe often visited them were several\npersons who had never heard him\npreach whose religions Sentiments\nwere at varience with his, and who\nmade no pretensions to Spiritual\nreligion. The good lady of the house\nbeing desirous that the occasion\nmight be improved for their special\nbenefit proposed to Dr. Payson that\nhe should give a religious exhortation\nto the Company purchance they might\nbe converted, which unclear he promptly\ndeclined Seeing at once the impropriety\nof the measure. Religion is\ngood for all men, undoubtedly,\nbut it cannot be thrust into the\nhearts of men. It must be welcomed\nthere. Even the visit to the bedside of\nthe sick does not always require the\nformal religious conversation and\nintercession, a Cheery look, a pleasant\nsmile, the introduction of some foreign\nSubject to call the attention away from","76cb1653cbe0bee9bc4a6ea14aed65d5.jpg"],[45859,"19\nself and Surroundings may be worth\nmore for the time being than an open\nBible and a formal prayer. \"A merry\nheart doeth good like a medicine.\" wrote\nthe Wise man. Sometimes anything like\nreligious formality in the presence\nof the Sick is interpreted by them\nas an intination that their case\nis much more serious than it is\nand hopes for recovery are destroyed.\nA prominent physician of New York\nCity relates an incident which well\nillustrates the imprudence of some\npastors, & religious visitors, I hope not many.\nThe patient was a lady of nervous\nsensibilities who was attacked with\nfever and a sore throat.

Lastly the model pastoral visit\nshould be undertaken only under\nthe most favorable physical and\nspiritual conditions on the part of\nthe pastor. The latter is of course to\nbe taken for granted. To be able to do\nothers good spiritually we must ourselves\nbe Spiritual and carry about with\nus the presence of the Master. A Season","4309a32ca5a205a84be5ebeb8a6427ba.jpg"],[45863,"21\nof prayer for specific fitness for\na specific case before leaving home\nis of great value. Our Spiritual\nman must be healthfully active, full\nof faith, and hope and discernment\nif we would awaken dead souls to\nlife, or call back the wayward\nto the life of godliness, or speak\nwords of comfort to souls in distress.\nBut along with this is the necessity\nfor a well and vigorous body.\nIt is a good rule never to go among\nthe people when you are weary. A\nprominent pastor in Chicago in lecturing\nto students upon this Subject advised\nthem to take an hour of Sleep after\ndinner before entering upon the\nwork of visitation. The distinctive\nwork of the pastor is quite as taxing\nto the mind and body of most men\nas the work of the Study and \nconsequently needs as careful a preparation\nfor it.

We must have ideas before\nwe can act; We must have truth before\nwe can walk therein; we must have\nprecept before we can exemplify.\nBut the relation which these sustain to Each\nother is very Singular and important.\n1. Precepts partake of the nature of the abstract.\nWe often get the thought, but we are at\na loss to know how to transmute it into\nan act. We get the theory but find it difficult\nto Execute it. Besides it is hard work\noften to take in the full meaning of a Statement.\nWe need to see an illustration.\nIt may be possible for some men to\nunderstand a theorem from the description","d5117b36c4a07c3598390a961f8fb65b.jpg"],[45929,"merely, but the most of us require a figure\nto be drawn and a demonstration.

He must see it to know. When God\nsays Thou Shalt love me with all thy heart,\nmind, might, and strength and thy neighbor\nas thy Self, it is possible for us to\nform some idea of what He means, but\nit is an idea in the abstract. How\nmuch better we understand it when\nwe see it illustrated perfectly in X.\nThe precept of Example is then to follow\nThe precept, and render it visible, \nand in this its great importance is Sun.\nAnd, besides it appeals to our senses\nand is often more powerful than the precept.\nAs a live man, in action, has greater\ninfluence over us than his picture","e1369307ac55315d51b9f659103512b0.jpg"],[45930,"so virtue moves us with greater impulse\nwhen we see it living and acting in\na good example.\nMany years ago a tutor in one of our\nColleges limped in his walk.

The tutor replied that he\nwas. \"I was there\", said the man, and I\nknew you by your limp. \"Well\" said the\ntutor it seems my limping made a greater\nimpression on you than my preaching.\nAh Sir! was the reply: it is the highest \ncompliment you can pay a minister to say\nhe is known by his walk rather than\nby his conversation.\nSeneca  once said of Socrates, that the\ncrowd of philosophers which followed\nthis unclear man derived more of their\nEthics from his manners than his Words.\nWhen native heathen converts are asked\n\"what first led you to think of becoming","6ac1fd8b0d193d127d088a8e31ead30b.jpg"],[45931,"Christians, was it a particular sermon,\nor address, or the reading of Gods word?\nTheir answer frequently is that the changed\nconduct of others who have become Christians\nfirst arrested their attention. \"I\nknew this man to be a Thief; that one was\na drunkard, another was very cruel and\nunkind to his family. Now they are all\nchanged. The Thief is an honest man, The\ndrunkard is sober and respectable, and\nthe other is gentle and kind. There must\nbe something in religion that can work\nsuch changes.\n2. Then there is power in Example\nto Encourage us to undertake the work\nof obedience.\nPrecepts tell us what our duties are,\nExamples assure us that they are possible.\nThe Psalmist at one time Said \"Through\nthy precepts I get understanding.\" at another\nhe seemed almost discouraged","60660fd5bb78081271e6b54ed876a6ea.jpg"],[45932,"at over being able to keep them and\nExclaimed, \"Such knowledge is too \nwonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain\nunto it.\" And so we would feel without\nthe example of some one before us who\nhas done it, and proved that we can\ndo the same. The same is true in\nsuffering affliction, when we are bidden\nto Endure chastisement. It seems impossible\nfor us to bear it patiently. But when\nsome grand scripture character is set\nbefore us of one who suffered in like\nmanner we are assured that it is\npossible by Gods grace to endure\nas he did. The Apostle James Encourages\nus to do this constantly, \"Take, said he,\nmy brethren, the prophets who have spoken\nin the name of the Lord for an example\nof suffering affliction and of patience\"\n\"Ye have heard of the patience of Job\nand have seen the End of the Lord;\nthat the Lord is very pitiful and of\ntender mercy.\"","edb91873fe5f5189b28ac602f8b6c299.jpg"],[45933,"3. Example also has great power over us\nbecause we are largely creatures of\nimitation. We act before we think,\nwhich is not Gods order. But because\nwe see some one else doing so me\nfollow him straightway, asking no\nquestions. This may sometimes lead in\nthe right way, but quite as likely\nin the wrong way.\nA right Example often stimulates real\nand reproaches our defects as nothing\nelse will. Herin is the utility of a\ngood man's biography. A writer has\nsaid, \"Never let the memory of a good man\nperish. It is worth too much to the living\nage to be allowed to go down with\nhim to the grave.\" Such a life is a\nmodel to be studied, upon its mould\nother characters may be formed.

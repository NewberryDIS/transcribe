But he refused to drum and demanded his rifle, proving himself to be an excellent marksman, he had his way.  These boys served their full time all were wounded but all got safely home at least.  They lived near Lake Minnetonka and I had some acquaintance with them before the war. Truer steel was never yet put into men.\n3. Standish - Decker - recruits who enlisted at the same time I did.  Standish was a good boy twenty years old son of a Methodist Preacher - his family of the Old Massachusetts stock.  He himself was born in Massachusetts. When the war broke out he was a student air(?) Hamline University. So also were Phillip Hamlin and Charles Berdan students and sons of Methodist preachers. Hamlin was killed at Gettysburg. So far as I know Berdan is living yet. He was twice wounded. There were, perhaps, a dozen more students of the university - among the Seargent Wright with whom I came most in contact and most admired.

And likening that here to real truth with regard to its extreme cruelty known, much would be done at least to soften its horrors if not to eradicate it from the worlds history. And knowing that the truth will never be known unless those who have witnessed its heart-skinning scenes record the same.  I have written this journal with a view to telling some truths that will not be recorded in its histories.  Yet many of these truths are so black, so very infamous, that I have been compelled from very shame to forego giving them a place in this record.  I had planned to write them separately, that such as desire it, might know them; but time and other important designs may deter me from my design.\nI have had many other motives for writing this work. I believe that the world would be improved were every man to leave a written record of his experience and the difficulties encountered in this world.\nBesides, having been an infidel, and having by the grace of God been led to see the utter folly, to say no worse, of infidelity, the years in which this change was wrought(?), however, disagreeable they may be in other respects, have in this connection reminiscenses which I trust will always be sacred to my heart. And I have felt it to be my duty to record it.  The reader will observe that I have kept my journal according to the feelings at the several periods of which I am speaking. And he will see that I experience no sudden change.  But by the experience.","18ce08408794c9c6daefc0250e823796.jpg"],[87603,"of years and much observation I gradually saw that in humble Christianity which I had so long indicated there are gems which for worth far exceed the wealth of the world. Nor in regard to religion, do I see anything in it which should make us mournful.  I am happier and more cheerful than ever before. That others may see and taste these blessed fruits is my earnest prayer.  Nor do I here wish to minluate(?) the idea that I have now attained perfection.  On the contrary I know that I have yet faults \"Huge as high Olympus.\" Yet knowing that \"God is very pitiful and of tender mercy\" and that he regards us as his thoughtless little children.  I believe he will in due time remove all these from me.\nGentle reader, you would suppose perhaps from this preface that this journal is in good truth a religious tract.  On this I imagine you will find yourself mistaken.  I have endeavored to tell frankly the truth. Read the book, for it is a better explanation than I can give in a preface.\nI now submit it to you inspection.\nDaniel Bond.","2b370f9fa61e7d6f19251a630f7de2f0.jpg"],[87604,"The 15th of April A.D. 1861 will long be remembered as the day on which the U.S. first government first gave evidence that it had the courage to resent treason.  On that day the President of the United States (Abraham Lincoln) first issued a call for 75000 men to suppress insurrection.  I had at that time made preparations to travel through Ill. But on the 11th I met my old friend J.M. Mulhollin with a copy of the late proclamation.  And also a paper enlisting men for the service.  I at once resolved to enlist as it was but for three months.  I was accordingly at a war meeting at Minneapolis on the 20th and that day news first came to us of the attack on the Massachusetts boys in Baltimore.\nOn the 22d our company was full; elected officers, and was accepted by the Governor.  After a visit home we went to drilling on the 24th, the citizens boarding us at the Cataract, and Nicolet. We remained in Minneapolis until the 29th when we marched to Ft. Snelling where we here mustered into the U.S. service.  I must confess that I was exceedingly verdant to say the least, besides being very slow to learn the drill.  But all this did not in my mind justify all the abuse which I imagined I was receiving from one John Hollett (Hoblett?).  After bearing with him nearly two weeks I finally had to go so far as to threaten fight before I could persuade him to desist.  He, however, saw the error of his way, asked pardon, and ever afterwards treated me like a gentleman.  Our company officers were Capt. Putnam, 1st Lieut. Wood, Second Lieutenant D.C. Smith.  We had an orderly Sergt. by the name of Hammon who seemed to control the appointment of all the rest of the non commissioned officers, and the first thing required in order to attain office was Ignorance, second Impudence, and last but not least, the aspirant must be what Yankees would call a \"Smart boy\" i.e. a perfect fool.","9aa5efead96a4f830fce4b485a839885.jpg"],[87605,"I did not remain long in the service.  This is owing to the fact that there was an order issued for us all to be mustered into the service for three years or during the war, or be discharged, so on the 20th of May I was discharged not at that time being ready to go for so long a period.\nOne of my reasons for not entering the service was because I feared being sent to duty on the frontier instead of going south against the Rebels.\nBut it so happened that the Regiment was ordered south, participated in the Battle of Bull Run in which they suffered considerable loss.  A call was issued for men to recruit the regt.  I at once decided that it was best for me to go.  On the 22d of August 1861 I repaired to Ft. Snelling and was duly mustered into the service.  Soon after entering I made the acquaintance of an Odd genius by the name of Hiram Wentworth, commonly called Long haired Wentworth. I also made the acquaintance of one M.G. Standish and likewise A.L.M. Decker. I quote from my Diary beginning Sept. 2d 1861\nMonday.  I left Mr. E.G. Browns. Jarve walked with me a short distance. We finally parted, it may be for ever. Tis a great consolation to have a friend like him at such a time as this. I arrived at the Fort about two oclock P.M. There has no one enlisted for the 1st Regt. since I left the fort last Friday. There is a report now current here that we are not to be sent to the regt. until 150 men have enlisted.  That being the number required to full up the Regt. If this should prove true we will likely lay idle for several month and I may visit home again.\nTuesday Sept. 3d\nI felt happy this morning. There was several recruits enlisted to day one by the name of Thomas Hughes. He is a brother of my friend Charly Hughes.  He was injured in his intellect when young by the small pox.  I had","eaed2a92787321f9d91ea7e23c616f10.jpg"],[87606,"The good fortune to get hold of a copy of Shelley's Works. I read Queen Mob at once.  It was fully equal to my expectations. I never read after a poet whose Sentiments so exactly corresponded with my own.\nWednesday Sept. 4th. Morning. I feel exceedingly joyful this morning. I am sitting by the Minnesota river just at the edge of the water. The Sun in his golden splendor has just risen. Hi rays are in glory reflected by the white sand rocks that are crowned by the almost classic walls of Ft. Snelling. Oh! the scene is too beautiful for description. Evening. We had a religious discussion to day with our drill Sergeant who it seems is afflicted with the halucination that there is a God. *  While we were resting he said something about God when Wentworth the long haired added: \"That is, if there is any God.\"  The Sergeant seemed amazed and in true Christian spirit exclaimed \"you brute.\"  A discussion followed in which the Sergt. was worsted.  When the confab ended out Christian friend had become quite too humble to call an Infidel a brute simply because he did not agree with him.  Lizzie Hurvey and W.F. Atkinson visited the fort today. I attended the Lyceum(?) which the boys of 2d Regiment have established. Their business matters wee carried on rather clumsily when compared with Highland Park.\nThursday Sept. 5th\nOur drill master and most of the man have been gone away to day. Consequently we had no drill. We are now sixteen in number.  I have had an opportunity to read some to day. I was reading in a book of visionary Imagination entitled A Panorama of Time by David A. Moor. It belongs to a young man by the name of Standish who thinks it is a great work. But I withhold my oppinion until I have finished reading it. I visited what I shall term the Elysian. \n\n I was a rank Atheist in those days, though not so much so now. In short I believe I am the farthest thing from it in the world.\nMARGINALIA: Christians often by using such expressions as \"you fool, you brute\" to infidels show them lack of the first principles of Christianity and give their enemies a very powerful weapon to use against them.","36a33f8957b98e93ce0ed89a4a3d83ea.jpg"],[87607,"\"Elysian Fields.\" * Reader should you ever be a Ft. Snelling do not fail to go up the Mississippi about half a mile Where two little valleys made down from the Highlands to the river. They are most beautifully Shaded with trees and there is only a small raise of ground between the two.  In one of them there is a spring of pure water. Be sure not fail to pass down them far enough to emerge on to the open land between the second bank and the river.  This Spot should be seen in Spring, summer, or Autumn, for it must be but a dreary place in winter.\nFriday Sept. 6th\nI continued reading \"The Panorama of Time\" I also studied Latin a little. We had no drill this forenoon. But we drilled well this afternoon.  My thoughts continue to bend on the kind friends I have left. But I will say that never in my life did I see so many civil and intelligent young men in one crown as the recruits of the 1st Regt.  To be among a set of men, ten or fifteen in number, away from female society, who employ their leisure time in reading and pleasant conversation, instead of Blackguarding and carousing is indeed surprising to human nature.\nSaturday Sept. 7th Morning.\nI feel Sad and Meloncholy. My mind is somewhat distracted owing in part to an unpleasant dream which I had last night. I finished reading the Panorama of Time this morn I think it has probably done me some good. It has some sense and more religion. I practices shooting with a revolver a while. Then strolled up the river and have there laid down in Solitude and written the above. But it is nearly noon and I must return to the fort.  Evening. I received a letter from Brother Benj, one from Mother, and one from Jarve.  Jarves made me feel good because it began with \"I reckon\" a classic known only to Jarve and myself. It is said\n\nWhen I was at the fort in the spring of /64 I was sorry to observe that the distroying hand of man had ruined this beautiful spot.","0ec07f3f10ea01fa46e7f2104a61f7ae.jpg"],[87608,"that we are to start for Washington next Tuesday. Be it so.\nSunday Sept. 8th  Morning.  I have been wandering up the Minnesota river among those beautiful willows that I so much admired when I was on guard last spring.  But it is now nearly noon and I must return.\nEvening.\nI have been throwing a heavy weight with the boys. I threw it the farthest of any one in the fort with a single exception.  This was I'm throwing it over our heads.  I beat the entire garrison throwing it forward.  There are about 300 men here now.\nMonday Sept. 9th\nI wrote to Jarve. And although it was raining I took my usual walk. I went to the grave yard. Not the one near the Fort but the one on the hill south of the road leading to Minneapolis, about a mile distant from the Fort. I found the following inscription on the tomb stone of a young mother who was buried by the side of her young babes. \n\n\"A common's grave is here. A dark haired daughter of Englands sunny(?) Isle. Her wedding garment for a shroud she's changed. And here her bridal fruit lays beside.\"\n\nTuesday Sept. 10th\nBadly sold! We started for Washington this morning; but when we got to St. Paul we had to turn back owing to a difference arising between Capt. Donnie and the officer appointed to superintend the transportation of troops from Minn.  In the afternoon Wentworth and I went to Minnehaha Creek above the falls where there is a pleasant gave. we found plenty of wilde cheeries and had a good time. Wentworth is a very entertaining companion but he","38ffcc03f1d2dd93f08d2f21d1042d97.jpg"],[87609,"is remarkably stoical in his doctrine.\nWednesday Sept. 11th\nWe had a drill to day. Till Pelotia my brother came along and I accompanied him a short distance on his way home and he gave me some good advice as to my conduct while in the service, but whether I will heed it or not is another thing.  Lieutenant Regaught came up and assured us that we would start for Washington tomorrow.\nThursday Sept. 12th Morning.\nWe have entereded upon a new era.  We left Ft. Snelling at five oclock and forty five minutes.  We halted about two miles from the fort and I took a last long look as we fell in and marched on.  We entered St. Paul to the tune of \"Yankee doodle\"  I felt both proud and sorrowful as I passed through the city.  We marched down 3d Street to the Landing ang[and] got aboard the Steamer Wenona and are now gliding merrily down the Mississippi.  The City is just receeding from my view. The trees will soon draw their curtain between us and it. Perhaps forever.\nEvening.\nWe are right at the head of lake Pepin. The boat is steaming smoothly over the tiny waves.  It is nearly sunset: the bluffs are so grand that I must pause to admire them. The scene is too beautiful for me to sit here writing, so no more tonight.\nFriday Sept. 13th\nLast night Wentworth and I sat on the hericane deck and talked till midnight.  I did not sleep more than an hour during the entire night.  We landed at LaCrosse at 6 A.M. and immediately took the cars for Millwaukee. Untill about 11 oclock our route lay through scrub Oaks, tamarac swamps, and pine lands with an occasional high and rocky bluff. After this we rode","35c97f6b629f9b3ac05a82f21ccc77ac.jpg"],[87610,"through oak timber until two when it changed to beech and maple.  We arrived in Milwaukee about half past three I should think. We took the cars for Chicago and are now on the way which makes it very difficult for me to write.\n[Written while the train was stopped at a station between Pittsburg and Harrisburg:]\nSaturday Sept. 14th\nWe arrived in Chicago last night and just had time to change cars and started for Pittsburgh. I fell asleep soon after we left Chicago and did not awake until we were in Lima Ohio. We arrived in smoky Pittsburg about 3 P.M. We imediately left for Harrisburg. It is now about 9 P.M. and the cars are starting so I can write no more.\nSunday Sept. 15th .  Morning.\nWe arrived in Harrisburg about 2 A.M.  The trains that left imediately afterward for Baltimore was so crowded that we failed to get off. Therefore we are compelled to lay over to day. Wentworth and 3 have been walking about the City and country. We had a bath in the Susquehanna. Visited the state house the grounds of which are tastefully laid out. The trees are most artfully trained in many fantastic shapes.  The young Eagles are kept there which serve to remind us of the cause in which we are engaged. The state Arsnel is near the capitol building here there are a great amount of arms. There are several batteries of Artilery here all ready for the field. The engine house is a magnificent structure capable of sheltering fifty two engines. There is also an engine manufactory which is a splendid building on the whole the city is a very beautiful one.\nAfternoon.\nI have traveled over the entire city I think it is by far the most beautiful one I ever saw. But it is corrupt in proportion to its beauty. Only last night a","c50ed579d59a83517ff4319cc45019ed.jpg"],[87611,"young girl was raped and murdered near the canal. They are searching the canal for her body to day. I visited the city reservoir. This is raised about thirty or forty feet about the common level of the City. It is about 60 feet in diameter and is fed by a large spout raising in the middle the water comes from the river and supplies the city. There are now about 7000 men encamped here.\nMonday Sept. 16th\nWe left Harrisburg this morning at 3 oclock arrived in Baltimore, passed through the city. at the depot of the Baltimore and Ohio railRoad we saw the bullet holes where the enraged irishmen fired their muskets when their officers would not let them fire into the mob that were attacking them as they returned from the three months service. We arrived in Washington about 5 P.M. I wrote to Benj#  #my brother  and then started in search of him. I went to the Post Office and mailed my letter, then after making some inquiries, I started and run about three miles, when not finding his Regt. I thought it was about time to return to our quarters at the soldiers retreat 40 rods from the Capitol.\nTuesday Sept. 17th\nI arose early this morning and went to the Capitol. I visited the picture galleries. I beheld the statues, I gazed upon the walls and columns of polished marble. I assended the dome and cast my eyes on the scene before me.  Munson's Hill and other points occupied by the rebel hordes were in plain view.  I could see thousands of our own tents artilery cavalry and infantry  *  camps in every direction as far as the eye could distinguish an object.  I could see the regular streets of the city laying beneath my feet.  Yet one relic of barbarism was there. the names of thousands who had assended the dome were written in pencil marks on the smooth white plank.  The building is yet unfinished notwithstanding it is magnificent beyond description. I left the Capitol and went it search of Berry, and after visiting a great number of camps\n\n It was in Washington that about this time Julia Ward Howe wrote the \"Battle Hymn of the Republic.\" Without knowledge of this fact no one can understand the Battle Hymn. [written in 1916]","d1bdf358784be7b032216c46a1a4a466.jpg"],[87612,"and traveling several miles, I at last found him in the nearest one to our quarters.  He was greatly amazed at my sudden appearance.  But the first excitement over he and I were soon engaged in pleasant conversation.  He borrowed the horse of one of his comrades for me and we took a ride into the country. After which we went with me to our quarters we visited the Capitol together. We then returned to the soldier's retreat and passed the evening happily in conversation. We next retired to rest that is lay down on a table and slept until morning.\nWednesday Sept. 18th\nI parted with Benj, possibly for the last time # but if our country demands it, be it so. We have got into a scrape. we are now at Georgetown without an officer or even a pass to show. It seems to me that officers ought to have more sense than to send a lot of men off to join their regiments in a country under martial Law without a scratch of a pen to account for them. And it seems to me that the boys are equally foolish to undertake such a job. I protested but told them I would go with them, even if we did get into a scrape, and now that we have got into a scrape, every one says he told us better but we would go ahead. Therefor I claim all the blame.  The boys have already begun to grow sick of a soldier's life. Now be it understood that those that complain are not of the first ones that enlisted for they are remarkably cheerful, patient and intelligent boys.\nEvening.\nWe at last got aboard of a government canal boat and started up the river. We have had a good time to day, where the boat has had to pass through several locks.  At one place we could have time to play in the woods, hunt grapes, and swim in the canal. The groves nestled among the rocks are indeed lovely. When about 16 miles from Washington we stopped for the night. From what I have been able to observe of the conduct of young Standish\n\nit was for the last time","02ce04f3d27c09bb2d31a55444aeeae2.jpg"],[87613,"I greatly admire him. I have to day promised to go with him into Co. H. I respect him most highly and I thing he would be a restraint on my wayward disposition. And I am willing to trust to the nobleness and goodness of his soul in almost any situation in which we may be placed. I believe there is room for many good boys in the world and I am happy to add him to the list of my friends.\nThursday Sept. 19th\nWe arrived in camp this afternoon. The boys were somewhat surprised to see me.  The Lieut. of Co. D (Hammon) had my name on the Co. roll without asking me. He was amazed when I told him I should go into H, with Standish than into D, with all my acquaintance there. Besides, A.L.M. Decker another noble boy is going into H. The fact is I am rather too well acquainted with D to have any particular desire to enter it. For I do not like Capt. Smith. I had a long gas with Charley Hughes. He gave me an account of the Battle of Bull Run. I will say that it detracts some from the glory of capt. Putnam. I believe I have a much better idea of it than I had from all accounts I had received before.\nFriday Sept. 20th\nWe had the \"Long Roll\" sounded to day I borrowed a gun of a sick man and prepared to be ready for a fight. But it did not come off; nothing but one of old Gorman's scares for the sake of having a big drill. I wrote to Jarve.\nSaturday Sept. 21st\nI wrote a letter for an old Irish man to day. The first letter I ever wrote for any one else and I sincerely hope it may be the last. It was to his wife. He would have me write a spell on a subject then on another and another. Then think of something more that he wanted to say on the first topic. Thus I\n\nIt should be remembered that a recruit naturally attaches much importance to the most insignificant occurrences.","d4c76f3c90c3651735824758077d8f7f.jpg"],[87614,"produced one of the most disconnected documents I ever saw. I could have done better at ten years of age for myself. I was just on the point of laughing at it when to my horror he informed me that his daughter a school Marm was to read it for his wife.\nSunday the 22d. I lay around and study Latin a little.\nMonday the 23d i drilled a very little.\nTuesday Sept. 24th\nI drilled but I have no gun yet. I wrote to Benj. Last night young Standish and I stole out of camp and slept in a hay stack. After last nights conversation I am more pleased with him than ever. He is remarkably fond of classical literature, but his education is so much superior to mine that I fear I do not interest him much.\nWednesday Sept. 25\nStandish and I had another good time at the haystack last night.\nThursday Sept. 26th\nI have written a long letter to Jarve today, and had another walk and conversation with Charley Hughes, which was very pleasant indeed.\nFriday Sept. 27th. On the 27th I did my first guard duty. It rained terribly. We had no straw in the guard tent; neither had I my blanket with me. nevertheless I slept very well. I had to laugh at an old Irishman. The same one for whom I wrote the letter the 21st. He got his gun cocked and for the life of him he did not know how to get the hammer down so he took off the cap and let it down on to the table then cocked it again to put a cap on; and finally had to call me to help him.

But hold! here are two officers. now perhaps I am in a scrape* - lold! they are privates but they have scared all the poetry out of me (written in the woods). Returning from this walk I found an old torn up love letter in which the lady was giving her heroe a setting up for not writing oftener. I soon ascertained by means of the dismembered fragments that they were truly in love and judging from the hand writing, good spelling, and just punctuation I should suppose her to be a lady of refinement, he no doubt can appreciate the value of his prize.  Wishing him a safe return from the war with the laurels of victory, and just promotion on his brow, and that they may be united and live happily together, I bid them adieu.

Neither am I so passionately in love with them as to be much hurt by their want of affection for me.  I am very glad I went into Co. H(or F?) thus completely flanking them.

When lo! an old gump of a Southerner came along offered me a dram of whiskey, I told him I did not drink. He then cast his unholy carcass on the ground and began to talk about his horses, this exactly coresponded with my poetical feelings, but I contrived to make myself so uninteresting that I soon got rid of him. He fled leaving me to my reflections. # But this was not all.  When I returned to camp an old Irishman, the same who did not know how to manage his gun, attacked me so unceremoniously about my wanderings that all my poetry fled.

I am laying in a shed of bush beside the Potomac which has risen more than three feet since yesterday morning. *On this first day of my picket duty I had some of the wildest notions that ever entered into the head of a human green horn, I suppose.  When those cannon were fired I immediately loaded my gun expecting fight. I then ascended a tree to see if I could see any rebels on the other side of the river, not knowing that it would have been no new sight to any one acquainted with picket duty. That night when it came my turn to stand picket, I held my gun cased and cocked and was attentive to every noise no matter how insignificant. I was the most watchful sentinel ever was in all my soldier experience, far more so that I was a few weeks afterwards when standing on the very outpost in Virginia. There was not the least possible danger of the enemy crossing the river that night.\n\nLater Gorman was appointed Brigadier General. The story of the whipping reached the United States Senate and he was in a fair way to fail of confirmation. The story had gotten into the papers. But Gorman got the Chaplain to write a flat denial of it to the New York Tribune. Not long afterwards his church made a Bishop of him and we got rid of him.

I saw him pale as death carried to the hospital. But the countenance of the poor fellow who held the gun was most pitiful to behold.  There is too much carelessness in our army.

What was the use to complain at these camp rations?  True it might be harder on a campaign. I stated these views to some of the soldiers, older in the service by three months than myself.  They immediately rallied on their military experience and on Bull Run, telling me if I had been there, it would do for me to talk.  If there is any position on earth that is disagreeable it is to be a recruit.  All the older ones, be they ever so green themselves, and the greener the surer it is to be so.  Will assume to know more than you, even about things which you have had as good an opportunity to observe as they have.  I learned by the experience of being a recruit to take the side of all future recruits of which we had many.  They never ceased to quote \"Bull Run\" to me, it being all they could quote, til after the battle of Fair Oaks.  Let a recruit but repeat a report which he has heard and he is at once lectured for being green enough to believe such reports; even though he has merely told it as a thing which he had heard without once insinuating that he believe it.  But to return to army rations while I am on the subject. On the march we receive what we call \"Field Rations\" consisting of hard bread, and meat, coffee, and sugar. Subsequent to the times of which I am speaking, Sour crout, Pickels,onions, and pepper were added to our rations, and I believe in still latter days, cod fish are issued. having now devoted a page to this matter I will proceed with","189181266ad2d3400d1f8a7c51723fac.jpg"],[87620,"21\nmy narrative. The second time I went on picket I thought it behooved me to secure a prize from some \"Secesh\" (?) accordingly after watching a round for some time, I managed to sieze a goose. I immediately made for a place where the canal crosses a creek just at this archway my retreat came near being cutoff by a man, a dog, and an old woman. I had to drop my prize lest I should be reported to head quarters and orders were strict in those days.  Some of the boys got hold of my failure and enlarged on it and finally had quite a rig on me for a few weeks, but some of the worst ones getting caught fairly stealing molasses, thier batteries were fairly silenced, and when they named goose, all I had to do was mention molasses.\nOn the 20th of Oct. a little after noon the Long roll was sounded and we were soon under arms and marched down to Edwards Ferry.  A few shell were thrown across the river and Co. E of our Regt. crossed in a flat boat to the other side of the river. After remaining a short time they came back and we returned to camp.  (About 2 miles distant).  We had orders to be ready to mark by daylight the next morning. and accordingly we left camp at an early hour on the morning of the 21st and were soon at the river. after some delay we began crossing over to Virginia, scarcely two companies had crossed when word came that Col. Baker's column which was crossing at Balls Bluff five miles up the river were within one mile of Leesburg and we were therefore hurried forward as fast as the crossing in two little flat boats and a skiff could be affected. We had not got more than two Regt. across when we heard the Battle open at Balls Bluff.  We could distinctly see the shells bursting, but no orders came for us to move. We might easily have attacked the enemy in the flank, but for some gross mismanagement. As it was, the little force at Balls Bluff was nearly annihilated while we laying within five miles and did nothing.  That night we commenced recrossing. this was continued until about midnight when the order was countermanded and the troops that had crossed back to Md. were soon return-","79bdabc34a1244aced78e944ba5162e6.jpg"],[87621,"22 \n-ing to Va.  A heavy rain now set in and we stood around in wet clothing until the next evening about five oclock when Co. I of our Regt. had orders to skirmish through a woods.  When they were right at the edge of the woods the enemy opened on them very suddenly from only a few paces distant.  There being an entire line of battle of rebels in the woods the company retreated as fast as possible.  Then a company of sharp shooters opened on the enemy they having pursued Co. I out on to the open ground.  Besides this a section of Pickets Battery opened on them and they were quickly repulsed.  One of Co. I was wounded and brought to the rear another was shot and left.  The more than brutal traitors bayonetted the wounded man.*  Gen'l Sander was also wounded in the leg from which he partially recovered, but died in February following.  It is believed the wound hastened his death.  After dark our Company was ordered on picket.  We approached near the woods whence Co. I had been driven, and it was so dark one could scarcely see a man three paces in the open ground. Judge them how it must be in a dense woods.  There an officer rode up and asked for twelve volunteers to skirmish the woods.  Without waiting for volunteers, our Capt. ordered the 1st Platoon forward.  I being in that plattoon we entered the woods keeping our groups of fours together we passed through the woods the enemy having abandoned the place.  We formed connections with 6 Companies of the 16th Ind. which had been cut off from the army for several hours and it was a wonder that the enemy did not attack and capture the whole of them.  In the morning we went to a house a little way off where we found a rebel soldier mortally wounded. He was a boy not more than 16 years of age, remarkably handsome, no doubt will long be mourned by his people.  He died the next evening. We found another dead in another house but a short distance off.  The next night about 1 A.M. being the 24th of Oct. we were ordered in and retired to the river and behold all the army but the pickets had\n\nThis was corporal Mitchel. The story is told in one of Gordon's poems.","7c7d86269492ef396bdaa9a4e179def7.jpg"],[87622,"23\nretired to the other side of the river.*  Our Regt. was the last to cross. Genl Stone being the last man on the boat and Col. Dana the next. So ended the Balls Bluff Blunder. During this four days campaign the lumbermen of our Regt were employed to the number of 300 in managing the boats winning from Genl Banks the high compliment. \"They are the Salvation of the Corp.\"  After this there were no more opporations worthy of note during the Autumn and winter of '61. The time was spent in drilling and building winter Quarters.  In those days I was very full of the potential idea of reforming the world, hence I suppose it was that I so much admired Shelley's poetry, for poetry is certainly is: / too much so for truth.)  I find on reading the letters that I wrote at that time I had some very wild fancies which have melted away before the stern light of experience.  During the winter I went so far as to prophesy the fall of the republic. Then again in the spring a little success made me prophesy the end of the war within a year.  But in this I was far more temperate than most of my acquaintences, for many of them were going home to celebrate the 4th of July.  How wild we were. One great cause why I dispaired of the country was because I had formed an idea from reading Plutarch that a true soldier embodied all that is manly; that he totally dispised luxury and show and that he never complained at the hardest fare, whereas I saw in our army a pettish disposition, complaining and whining like little girls for mere triffles.  I saw that show parade and what we call style was what most of the officers and men esteemed as the most necessary requisites to good soldiers. This disgusted me and shook my faith in the success of our cause.  Another\n\nIt was very cold and windy on this last night of our stay in Virginia.","86cbe670dfecef8f46474cfc653de449.jpg"],[87623,"24\nreason why I feared for the country was the base surrender of those arch traitors Mason and Slidell.  I would have been willng to have accepted this as an humble military necessity; but when I beheld the whole country rejoicing over it as of a great victory, then indeed I said this people are not worthy of liberty and therefore will not retain it.  Secretary Sweard* the base coward was landed as a great hear.  Moreover I beheld the universal corruption of all classes in the eastern states.  These facts taken together with the tardiness of the government to recognise the rights of the African race, threw a gloom over my mind which I found it very difficult to dispel.  I resolved to devote myself to the war long or short and if the nation did die, I was determined it should not be my fault.  These opinions which I held and which I \n\nAt the laying of the corner stone of the national cemetery at Gettysburg Sweard took occassion to boast of his \"Irrepressable conflict.\"  Now I wish to say that he basely surrendered that noble position at the out break of the rebellion.  Any thig to avert the war.  \"Carry your slaves where you please only save our woardly heads\" ifthese are not the words they are the substance of his position at that time.  \"I would rather be a dog and bay the moon than such an American.\"  I would rather, had I been in his position at the time of the Trent Affair have used the language of the rebell Buckner in response to Genl Grants demand for","cb64771e0d531f136455aa9d16d71c40.jpg"],[87624,"25\ntook every occassion to preach to others made me many enemies when I first entered the service.  But I believe I also made friends of another class by the same meanes. My disposition is not half way conservatism. and I have no desire that it should be so. I am radical in my nature and I am glad of it.  This same spirit has often caused me to be accused of hero worship. I confess that when I do admire any one I am liable to the mistake of lauding him to the skies.  Whereas no human being will bear praise beyond a certain degree. I carry my dislikes in a similar manner entirely too far.  But it is time to return to my narrative.\nNov. 26th\nAbout this time, I received notice of my brother Benjamins death. I was in rather poor health my self at the time and the sad news went very hard with me.\nI had in those days a very poetical idea of drill and discipline. I supposed it was absolutely necessary to understand the bayonet exercise to perfection. But in reality this branch military instruction is merely ornamental since the bayonet is never used in action.  The time was passed during the winter in drilling, and in doing guard and picket duty. Finally on the 25th of February we broke up camp and marched.  The roads were very bad.  We marched that day about 13 miles and encamped near Sugar Loaf mountain.  The next day we marched to Adams Town where we took cars to Harpers Ferry. On the way we passed Point of Rocks where there was a rebel battery that might have shelled our train very easily, and in fact a few nights afterwards did open on a train as it was passing.  We went over into Harpers Ferry village and quartered for the night in one of the old government buildings.  The next morn The town was thoroughly ransacked even the halls of secret societies were broken open and their records scattered.  I visited the engine room where John Brown was captured it still bore the marks of the contest.  I also went to what is stiled Jeffersons Rock. This is a flat table like rock on top, and is about 100 feet above the level of the river. It is reported that Jefferson once addressed the people of","f2be7bed69bdbe2debb82d2e3ec83db7.jpg"],[87625,"26\nVirginia from this rock.\nWe remained in Harpers Ferry a few days. Our company acting as provost guard we then marched to Bolivar(?) Heights where about 2 miles distant where we remained for several days. Then we marched to Charleston where after a short stay we moved on to Berryville we drove the rebels before us out of the village. Some of the printers of our regt. took possession of the Office of the Berryville Conservator and published two numbers of a paper to Suit their own politics.  We marched on the 12th of march to Winchester and back to Berryville the same day. This was the first day Col. Sully commanded the regt. the boys were well pleased with the prospect. We eventually returned to Harpers Ferry where we took the cars on the 22d of March to Washington. We remained in Washington several days. Our dress parades in the Capitol Grounds were very successful. We were finally to be received by the President, but Old Gorman got mad and showed his narrow mindedness by breaking it up.  We soon went across the Potomac to Alexandria where on the 29th of March we embarked for Hampton Roads.  We steamed down the river a few miles that night and anchored.  Just at daylight we got under way and passed Mount Vernon and Ft. Washington. It was so fogy that I could not get a good view of Mount Vernon but I have since had several opportunities to obtain as good a view of it as the thick foliage would permit. We anchored that night in the mouth of the Potomac. The next night we anchored at Fortress Monroe. On the 1st of April we landed at Hampton. This village has been burned to ashes by order of the traitor Magruder.  While we were camped near this place we had an opportunity to read the inscription on several of the old grave stones. Some of them bore the date 1657. We left here on the 4th and moved on to Big Bethel where our forces were defeated last year now was this surprising considering the position and the pains that had been taken to fortify it.  There was a deep morass to cross in order to approach thier works, which stood on a considerable elevation. We entered these works the enemy having abandoned them and encamped for the night.","0a8fa7180a4f3805e9991459836ae92c.jpg"],[87626,"27\nOn the following day we moved on and encamped near the old Rebel camp appropriately designated Camp Misery. The ground here is so low and flat that the water will not run off and as it rained almost incessantly during the 5 days we remained here our situation can better be imagined than described.  No effort on our part could render us comfortable as we had no means at that time of raising our tents and beds from the ground.  I doubt not we might have been more comfortable than we were had we been more experienced.  But as it was we were wretched enough.  On the 10th we moved up close to the enemy's works formed our lines and opened the siege.  Here our duty was heavy enough; on picket every other day and on detail nearly all the rest of the time.  We built hundreds of miles of corduroy roads build forts then up work. It rained daily and disease was already thinning our ranks.  On the morning of the 4th of May. I was one of a large fatigue party engaged hewing timber for a mortar battery designated battery no. 8. We had just commenced work when the chief of engineers rode up and told us that our work was completed the enemy having abandoned their works during the night.  We returned to head quarters left our tools and by the time we reached our regts. they were all under arms and preparing to march Genl Dana's brigade was already in the enemy's works.  And in a few minutes we were also in the rebel camps. Here we found plenty of bacon, beans, flour, camp equippage, and every species of ugly knife for which the Chivalry of the South have ever entertained so warm an affection.  They had entered the army with the hallucination that they could bully the northern soldiers with these knives as they had been accustomed to bully our cowardly congressmen of yore. But a few weeks listening to the screaming of shells and the whistling of mine balls had convinced them","5a03ee45144fcd84784cb8e3010fae07.jpg"],[87627,"28\nhow worse than useless it was to encumber themselves with such weapons in the stern realities of the contest before them.  And so little did our boys care for such things that they passed them by with only a few contemptuous remark about the men who were green enough to bring the weapons so utterly impotent to war.  Thus we see that the rebels had learned one of the many lessons which this war has taught them.  We likewise found several letters of defiance addressed to the D___d yankees.  The traitor Gen. Magruder had placed torpedoes in the works whereby several of our men lost their lives. On the morning of the 5th our advance came up with the rebels at Williamsburg and a battle ensued in which the rebels held their own until they were ready to retreat.  We embarked on transports May 6th and on the 7th arrived and landed at West Point. Here we found Franklin's Division hotly engaged with the enemy.  We landed and moved up to the support of some of our artilery.  The enemy ran out a battery and opened on our shipping in York River. The gunboats replied sending their heavy metal with such effect that the rebel battery was soon silenced.  About the same time our infantry succeeded in repulsing the rebel attach and so ended the Battle of West Point.  A few days after this our Regt. was on picket on the ground whence our gunboat had driven the enemy's battery on the 7th.  I had now an opportunity to observe the power of heavy artilery.  The shells had made holes in the ground each deep enough to bury a horse.  One had passed under the ___ a pine tree about eight inches in diameter, exploded, lifted the tree straight up, and set it down about 10 feet from where it originally stood.  It still stood on end its roots leaning against another tree.  This was done at a range of nearly three miles.  No wonder the rebels could never stand gunboats.","467e5b8b2e7608ca5592f4c5b550e025.jpg"],[87628,"29\nAfter remaining at West Point a few days we moved a few miles up the Pamunkey River.  We encamped on a large plantation. Exceedingly beautiful are the green meads, the lovely locust trees, the vineyards and orchards, arround this ancient homestead. Landed on three sides by dense pine forests, while on the other flows the Pamunkey whose various windings might rival Meander itself.  I visited the old family burying ground, copied some of their inscriptions but I am sorry to say I have lost them therefore cannot give them here.\nOn the 16th of May I had my first taste of the extreme hardships of a soldier's life.  After standing guard the previous night in soaking rain we were compeled to act as rear guard during the day. the army moved only about 12 miles; but the rain continued during the entire day.  The mud was very deep.  In places however we found bottom at a depth of not more than four inches; this was a great misfortune, for said bottom was about as hard and smooth as ice.  Of course we would slip and fall in the super striation(?) of mud. The some soldier who had not the \"milk of human kindness\" in his heart / nor in fact any other kind of milk in his stomach / would exclaim: \"Another map of the state of Virginia.\"  tent to one but he would fall himself while jeering his unfortunate comrade.  Before night the entire corp became stragglers and being the rear guard it was our duty to keep them up as well as we could.  Our guard became scattered itself.  At last we wallowed, rather than walked into camp.*  We camped in the forest and laid over the next day.\n\nI could not pass this subject without remarking on the sweet sleep which I enjoyed that night.  Laying down in our wet and muddy clothes with no shelter save what we afforded by our guns blankets we enjoyed a slumber the likes of which no \"Lord of wontoness and ease\" ever tasted on bed of softest down.  And by the way, I will here remark that a green grass plat is the nicest bed many ever enjoyed.  Byron understood this when he said: \"Ours the green turf and not the feverish bed.\"","0d9ee9ba8aa06afe038b1d1bec297686.jpg"],[87629,"30\nWe left this place on the 18th of May, moved only a few miles and encamped in a wheat field.  However this day we passed through New Kent C. H. which in truth is nothing but a Court House and jail. and miserable things they both are.  Nevertheless there is one object of interest even in this insignificant county seat. I allude to an oat tree.  I have seen several larger oaks. What then is interesting about this oak tree?  Nothing but the unparalleled spread of its branches.  We all agreed that it could not be less than 100 feet from the extremities of one limb to the extremities of its opposite neighbor.  Its top seemed nearly round resembling an umbrella. Its leaves and branches were very thick forming a delightful shade in which our entire Regt. 800 rested while they talked of its grandeur.  I said we camped in a wheatfield. Here it was that the boys of our regt. first begun that trade which afterwards was brought to great perfection, viz. making pipes of laurel root.  Upon this amusement of the soldiers I got up (if I may be allowed the expression) the following sentiment.  \"The pipe of peace, is carved by the sons of Liberty, from the root of the tree of victory.\"  Here also I heard a prophecy that our army would enter Richmond before the 1st of June. I demurred but my battery was quickly silenced by the steady fire of the readers of the N.Y. Herald though I must say it was not a votary of the Herald that first made the statement.  And here let me say that had the Herald said less about what Gen. McClellan would accomplish in a few days, it might have been better for that officer. But that contemptable sheet took our General and his army, marched over the entire Confederacy, and finally, threw them against the invaders of Mexico, dethroned Napoleon and shook the center of all European monarchies, in the remarkably short space of one month.  Our soldiers to do them justice were not quite so badly infatuated as to accompany Field Marshall Bennet on this Quixotic expedition#. But I have heard them say time after time that there never was a general equal to McClellan. But I must return to my story.\n\nHorace Greely has been honored with the title of general for his renowned home strategy, tactics, grand tactics and engineering skill.  But I think Bennet excels him as a carpet knight. Therefore I have promoted him as I think he deserves.","ef217177906fd9059b61f2ddf3f991b6.jpg"],[87630,"31\nOn the morning of the 19th we struck tents at an early hour. The rising sun gave us warning of an excessively hot day with which prospect we were by no means delighted.  This day, while it was yet morning and every thing was pleasant we passed the church where twas said Our Great Washington acknowledged Hymens(?) right to rule supreme over the lives of men.  As we approached the ancient structure from the east the road on either side for near eighty rods is lined with a double row of beautiful cedars. While to the south west extends a great forest of oak.  It seemed that this forest was full of little birds \"And they sound joyous each and all\" as their euphoreous notes well attested. The church itself was in a remarkably good state of preservation.  It was a brick building with a brick spire of no great pretensions. The building was small, but neatly and tastefully constructed.  If my memory serves I would say that it was of Gothic style.  But there was but very little architectural display in its construction.  It was not long after we had passed the church before the rays of the sun began to tell on our frames in a most pitiless manner.  The weaker ones were falling out, and the perspiration was flowing from every pore of the stronger.  Many fainted; some died.  We did not march very far, but there were several things which we had not then learned, and we suffered accordingly.  Our knapsacks had many things in them which were superfluous. I lighted mine this day by throwing away an overcoat.  About 3 oclock P.M. we camped near the Richmond and York River Rail Road . 14 miles from Richmond.  Here whiskey rations were issued and the consequence was that several of the men got drunk. The ration was not large enough to intoxicate a man. But here the avarice(?) of some men pandered to the appetites of others thus we had our rumsellers and rum drinkers.  I think the whiskey ration if a plan could possible be devised to govern it properly would do no harm; but on the contrary under certain circumstances might do a great","f4c58523140c3d3a31d3c203a42fc953.jpg"],[87631,"32\ndeal of good.*  They tried a plan in our regt. which could it have been followed would have restrained the improper use of the drug.  But it failed.  The plan was for every man to march up take his whiskey and drink it at once in presence of the Srgt. But how would this work where the orderly seargeant was a hard drinker.  Rations were drawn from the commissary for every man in the company.  Some did not drink the consequence is easily foreseen, either the rest would get more than a ration or there would be some left. In the latter case the Sergt took it to his tent, used it to excess and was never in a fit condition to attend to his duties.  As I shall have occassion to ventilate this subject at large in several instance I will leave it for the present.  From this camp we moved to a place called Tyler's Farm about 10 miles from Richmond.  We remained here several days.  Here as a result of the whiskey ration our Orderly Sergt was reduced to the ranks.  While we were at this camp we were detailed to build a bridge across the Chicahominy.  We worked in mud and water very frequently waist deep. The last evening of our labor we were cheered by the sound of Battle at Hanover Court House.  And before day we were on the move to support Gen. Porter's column which had been engaged, but there was no more fighting and so we returned to our old camp May 30th.  About noon on the 31st, we heared heavy firing on the other side of the Chicahominy.  We soon received orders to be ready to march with only one days rations and our rubber blankets. In a short time we were on the move and were soon at the bridge which our regt. had thrown across the stream and which was two miles from our camp.  Here Gen. Sumner received orders to march for the first time.  He had acted thus far on his own responsibility and it was well he did so. Had he acted otherwise the two Corp which were already across the stream must have been annihilated. Our regt. was in advance of the Corp and as soon as we were fairly across the stream Gen. Sumner rode up to Col. Sully\n\nThis of course was the nonsensical notion of a greenhorn.","b6b70a386385b3aa09454e24cbcca5c4.jpg"],[87632,"33\nand ordered him to move forward with all possible haste.  The order was obeyed we pressed onward part of the time at double quick pace. We soon began to meet stragglers each of which was invariably the only or about the only man of his regt. which was left.  We moved on a little farther and began to meet wounded men they usually spoke moderately that the Battle was going rather against us and we were needed badly on the field. Col Sully soon halted to load. After we were loaded he gave us this march instruction. \"Men I want you to fire low.\"  His voice was not raised seemingly above his common talk. Yet from that day until the end of the war I believe I never fired my gut without thinking of his words.  We again resumed a rapid pace and soon arrived at the scene of action. We had now got the start of our brigade some distance.  We were met by Gen. Abercrombie and ordered to the right. We now moved altogether on the double quick.  We soon arrived at our propser station it was in a wheat field. The enemy were already emerging from the woods on the opposite side. The Col. ordered us forward as if he would attack them. There was a gap at that time of not less than eighty rods between our left and the extreme right of the rest of the army. When they saw us they fell back into the woods and our Col. ordered us to lay down; this order we were very willing to obey for two reasons.  Safety, and rest.  We could now see the enemy moving to the left.  But before they could complete their arrangements for cutting us off from the rest of the army our brigade had arrived.  And two regts of Abercrombies brigade were ordered to move to the right and form connections with our right.  This maneuver was nearly accomplished when the rebels appeared at the edge of the woods and poured a voley upon them. They immediately fronted and returned the fire.  I noticed","c6e2132225e57d4910a2c28b1ba68bcd.jpg"],[87633,"34\nthat their first volley mainly went towards the tops of the woods.  But after that they stood and fought for nearly two hours without seeming to stir out of their tracks.  This was the longest stand still and fight that I ever saw; and what was more strange although they were in open ground, their loss was very small. Soon after the rebels began their attach to the left of our Regt became engaged. They captured a Colonel and Adjutant and about half dozen other prisoners. One man, in our company (which was on the right) was struck by a stray ball; it entered his forehead and passed entirely through his head. He died next morning. His name was Nicholas Hammer a Dane.  He had served six years in Europe, and had participated in a number of battles.  Another man was wounded which was the entire loss of our Regt.  It was nearly dark when the enemy was repulsed. We lay on our arms in line of battle during the night. But there was little demonstration made by the enemy until about 9 A.M. when they made a furious assault on our Centre but were met, repulsed, and pursued for some distance.  So ended the Battle of Fair Oaks.  One good joke connected with this battle was that some of the chivalry having rode out in their carriages with their ladies to see the vandal Yankees driven into the Chikahominy lost their fine vehicles, horses and all 'a prey' (?) to the ruthless invaders and now citizens, take warning and keep at a respectful distance from battle fields, unless you go to be useful in some way or other; for, if you go to see the elephant tent to one bet you will get a better view than you desire. no possible good can arrise from your idle curiosity which really is an insult to the men who are doing the bloody work. and you will receive little sympathy from them in any misfortune which may befall you when you are so much out of your place.  I do not mean to say that citizens might not do a great deal of good by assisting in caring for the sick or taking a gun and","b6ec9366d8061b128d02125a6ad731d6.jpg"],[87634,"35\nfighting, but, I do say, unless they intend to do something they would better to keep away.\nWe lay under arms during the day, but the enemy made no further demonstrations. We now began to construct breastworks, and were soon well-fortified.  On the 3d of June, I went back to the old camp, found that our bridge had floated away, and I was compelled to wade through mud and water for nearly half mile, this put me to reflecting on what might have been the result had the enemy attacked 24 hours later.  Most likely they would have ruined our army. And now for the first time I began to reason on the thousand instances in life where we see everything depending on very slight circumstances.  I did not then call it Providence.  But fate.  And I would often quote, \"There is a tide, in the affairs of men, Which taken at its flood; leads on to fortune\"\nBut I never quoted another which I now deem more appropriate and therefore use it. \"There is a Providence which shapes our ends; rough hew them as we will.\"\nI shall have plenty of opportunities to shew where my life or the lives of some of my comrades have been spared in a manner which would seem almost miraculous. And as it is with individuals, so is it with nations.  The result of a battle, nay, often of a war, may hang on the slightest circumstance.  \nWe continued to fortify our position; building strong breast works and cutting down the timber in front; until no enemy however strong, could have broken our lines by a direct assault. But when the enemy had reinforced sufficiently, of course nothing was to hinder them from flanking us, and this the[y] effectually accomplished a few weeks later.  The enemy soon contracted the disagreeable habit of shelling us two or three times a day, moreover, they would attach our pickets at night so that we were by no means certain of a good nights repose.  Our regt. was relieved from picket duty","1fbf3c7df7b24aceb926d1db872ca77a.jpg"],[87635,"36\nbecause they could use the ax better than the eastern men.  We were in a very unhealthy location this was in part owing to the late battle and in part to the low swampy nature of the ground. Many were sick and I confess I was not very well able to labor cutting timber. But, I was green enough to think it was a military necessity and was very well contented so long as I could see any use in all this cutting and digging. But, after I saw our fortifications were so strong, that no number of enemies could possibly carry them; I acknowledge I grew a little impatient, however I said nothing to my comrades, nor did I write any complaints home. Toil by day, and little rest by night, in an unhealthy country; can it be a wonder than many sickened and died while the remained grew thin and emaciated? After a few hard days work, (perhaps in the rain) we have laid down at night for much needed repose. but Hark! a gun another, another, in quick succession and with constantly increasing rapidity the reports of deadly weapons call every man to arms. Just as we are fairly in the ranks the cannon open their brazen throats. The firing ceases instantly. One would think that these great monsters rule the lesser imps with imperial sway, that they have commanded silence and no one dares disobey. They speak a few times more as if scolding their underlings for their disorderly conduct and all is still. We retire again but to go through the same routine. Such, is the life of him, \n\n  \"Who sleeps with his head upon the sword, \n   His fevered hand must grasp in waking.\"\n\nWhile we lay at Fair Oaks, one man was killed by a shell this was ll the loss in our regt. with the exception of one who was killed by a mistake of the 34 New York regt on picket in the night. N.B. I mean after the battle.","0cf0522f89c51d84fe70701b62b5c248.jpg"],[87636,"37\nOn the 25th of June, Gen. Heintzelman moved forward and drove the enemy before him to within 3 miles of Richmond. But fell back immediately.  This did not come under my own observation but is as I have heard it.  Certain it is that he made an advance and approached neared the reb capital than any other commander reached on that campaign.  On the afternoon of the 26th the great battle opened on our right consisting of Porter's and Franklin's Corps, which were on the opposite side of the Chicahominy, and were advance up the stream a few miles farther than we were.  The firing of the Artilery was heavy and rapid lasting until after dark.  Then came a report of victory.  We had hitherto been under orders to keep strict silence so that there had not been a musical instrument heard during the month. But now the bands struck up the patriotic airs, and loud and long Hurrahs made the forests ring.  The rebel bands also opened, and their soldiers screamed and yelled after the manner for which they are noted.  There is this difference between the noise made by the two parties.  The cheer of a northern soldier is a course heavy Hurrah! while that of a southers is a fine scream more like the voice of a woman. And when they charge they make a similar noise.  There is nothing more provoking than this to an enemy. Especially when they have the best of the bargain and are screaming in pursuit.\nEarly on the morning of the 27th the battle was renewed and we discovered to our surprise and sorrow that our forces had retreated near four miles during the night and were now just opposite us.  We could distinctly see the battle raging.  We could see our infantry advance at one time and retreat at another.  The the rebels advance and","a758aa0f8aae964687ebd590bdc0d72e.jpg"],[87637,"38\nand retreat in like manner.  We could see the filing of the artilery and the bursting of the shell.  This was a day of awful suspense.  And a deep gloom fell like a pall over the countenances of the soldiers.  In short, it was well known that we were being worsted(?).  About noon reinforcements moved from our flank to support the right. Night came about. The soldiers were required to lay on their arms at the breastworks. On the morning of the 28th, I was detailed to help draw rations.  The brigade commissary was a short distance in the direction of the bridge across the Chicahominy, which had been reconstructed, what was my surprise! to find Porters and Franklin's corps drawn up in line battle on our side of the stream and at a direct right angle with our lines.  Batteries unlimbered(?), and looking directly toward the old bridge which had been destroyed behind our retreating column.  There was no room to doubt that the enemy had broken our right flank; driven them across the stream; and were now between us and our base of opperations.  But a happy thought struck me, our army is now massed on one side of the Chicahominy; It is on the same side that Richmond is; our General will now order a charge on the rebel works, we will carry them; enter the rebel capital; and cut Lee's army off from all supports and supplies; we will then attack him and compel his surrender.  This was very nice to talk about and think about but would probably have met opposition in its execution.  I believe however I was not alone in this happy expedient, as one of our Generals after stated before the \"Committee on the Conduct of the War\" that he expected nothing less on the morning of the 29th than a grand assault on the enemies works.  But it seems strange to","d115f46462fd6ddff11daa12c1fffbba.jpg"],[87638,"39\nme that a general, who, had any opportunities to make observations, could not see that the whole of the 28th was spent in preparations for a retreat.  I altered my oppinion before noon of the 28th.  Returning to camp about noon (There was a brisk artilery duell going on). A case shot exploded just in the right position to drop its leaden contents on every side of us. My comrade, who was with me, was just missed by more than half dozzen balls, and they fell around me in like manner.  And here are a few strange circumstances connected with this same solder, whose name was Marion Abbott, and myself.  Every battle which we entered my file leaders were either killed or wounded until he would stand for my file leader.  And the first time he went into battle as my file leader he was wounded.  This was at Gettysburg on the 2d of July and he was the only man in our company which was wounded on that day.  After we arrived in camp we lay down behind the breastworks. I noticed that my feet were more exposed than they would be if they were drawn up closer to the works. I therefore drew them up just in time to save one of them from a piece of shell about an inch square which struck just where it had laid a minute before.  The rebels moved out and attacked Smiths Division which joined ours on the right its own right laying on the Chicahominy.  They were repulsed with severe loss and afterward seemed inclined to be quiet until we should be ready to leave our works of our own accord.  We got very little sleep that night. And before day light we were on the move retreating toward the James River.  When we arrived at a place known as the Peach Orchard we were hastily drawn up and had a little battle with the enemy our brigade was not actively engaged but supported one of our batteries a few shell fell amongst us","da150a9112f04b201dcf2be30a4a94e3.jpg"],[87639,"40\nbut I believe no one was hurt.  I cannot tell exactly what divisions engaged the enemy but Kearnes was one.  The enemy were repulsed.  We retreated to Savage Station. The weather was so very warm that many of the soldiers fainted from the intensity of the heat.  At Savage Station there was immense stores of ammunition, rations, and hospital supplies.  These were set on fire.  It seemed to take the enemy some time to resoslve to attack us here.  The field in which our division was massed was near three fourths of a mile square. At length the rebels run out a battery and opened on us.  This battery was stationed on the north western corner of the field and were in the southeastern corner a battery of 10 powder rifled guns replied with such spirit that the rebel battery was silenced in less than five minutes. The infantry on both sides now advanced and met in the woods just at the western end of the field and a short but bloody battle ensued our Company lost 13(?) men killed and wounded the enemy were repulsed losing one General (Griffin I think) at the first onset the 106 Pennsylvania which was just on the right of our regt broke and fled in the wildest confusion leaving our flank exposed but we did not yield an inch of ground, and other reliable troops soon came to our assistance.  The brush was so thick in the woods that I did not see a single enemy during the battle, but when it had terminated we found rebels within 40 feet of our lines.  After dark we withdrew from Savage Station and marched nearly all the remainder of the night.  After crossing the White Oak swamp we took about 2 hours rest.  I must here remark how we suffered on this nights march for water. The roads were dusty, and it is a fact well known to any","bb798b9e7ff2aaeffe136b2a4f9d925a.jpg"],[87640,"41\nold soldier that a battle will create thirst quicker than any thing else.  As soon as it was fairly light we were again on the move but waiting for the trains we moved very slowly and had not marched more than five miles before on oclock.  The enemy were now attempting to force a passage across the swamp in tow placed.  We were ordered to about face and double quick back a distance of two miles.  We had not more than arrived on the ground and passed our battle line when we were ordered to double quick back to where we first started making four miles at double quick time. Many fainted so that when we arrived on the ground we would not have numbered more than 200 men.  We formed a line and marched forward. This was at a place known as Charles City Cross Roads. While we were forming Gen. Sumner rode up to the regt. and addressed us as follows:  If I send this regt. into those woods I don't expect to see it come out.\"  We were greatly puzzled to know what the general meant by this remark. But most of supposed he meant that we would be annihilated.  But he realy meant that though several different regiments had went into the woods, they had all been driven out again and he expected that we would remain and check the enemy. There was a regt. just then going into the woods ahead of us and we advanced across the field to its support but just as we had arrived at the edge of the woods that regt came back in the wildest disorder.  I should here remark that although bullets were flying like birds in the air we had not yet had a man wounded in our Regt. We halted in the edge of of the woods and lay down.  It was now growing dark and the 16th North Carolina regt was advancing on us.  But their Colonel must have been a fool. He had not a single skirmisher in advance of his regt though the woods was very dense, besides he had his regt. formed in close columnly division.","8233807aac149b64483f8354d8ad7e10.jpg"],[87641,"42\nThus they were advancing a few of his front divisions firing seemingly at random. By which however the[y] wounded Capt. Colville and one Private Robert Leeson belonging to Co. F. was killed.#  They came right into our company and when they were not more than three rods distant we raised on our knees and fired into them. They broke and fled in the wildest confusion without so much as returning our fire.  Thus one Company alone had routed a regt. they left about a dozen men killed and wounded on the field though not more than twenty men had fired on them.  We were not molested after this.  We lay on the ground until about 10 oclock that night. And my prayer is that I may never listen to such sound of agony again the groans in that woods would have moved a heart of stone accompanied as they were with the most piteous pleadings for help. Words like these after came to my ears.  Oh! do somebody bring me a drink. Oh Oh some one come and help me. won't some one help me?  I could not refrain from tears but none of my comrads knew that I wept.  I have since heard similar notes of agony on many bloody fields.  But who after one nights such experience can doubt that.\n\"The drying up of a single tear has more of honest fame than shedding seas of gore.\"\nLet us learn lessons by the past that the quiet bosom of our peaceful land may never more be disturbed by the groanings of the helpless writing of relentless War.\nThat night I repeated often these lines to myself. \n\"When, when Supplanting discords iron reign,\nShall mercy wave her olive wand again.\"\nBut as I shall have ample occasion to speak of the horrors of war hereafter I will now proceed with my narrative.  About ten oclock we were called in; We had\n\nHis last words were \"Boys do the best you can for I am gone up.\"","e752db67d99cfe3f8bcbc4a2915306d1.jpg"],[87642,"43\nbeen ordered to throw off our knapsacks at the Commencement of the battle and we were now marched away without them. Thereby I lost my diary up to the time of the battle which so discouraged me that I never attempted to keep one again untill the 9th of August 1863 which was after the Battle of Gettysburg. So I must continue writing from memory until I have written more than one more year of history after which as I have the records preserved.  I hope to be able to do much better.  We marched to Melvin Hill at which place we arrived a bout two oclock on the morning of the 1st of July.  We slept untill day light.  After making coffee we immediately formed in Battle Array. Now speaking about coffee I will here make a few remarks about this solace of a soldier's existance.  No one who has not experienced it can tell the virtue of it to a work and wearied system.  But during this entire retreat from the time we left Fair Oaks on the 29th of June until we arrived at Harrison's Landing on the 2d of July I did not eat the amount of one cracker lived altogether on coffee.  I had no appetite for anything else and yet I stood all the hardships though sick and worn to skin and bone.  Our Corps was stationed on the left and was not more than just in position before a rebel battery opened on us they did not hurt any of our regt though several were wounded in the brigade.  We were then removed into a woods still further to the left where we remained in peace and quiet during the entire day.  I saw Gen. McClellan on the field early in the morning riding along the lines and superintending the movements of the troops.  And again in the after noon he rode along where our corp was concealed in the woods and the boys commenced to cheer him.","89a58b64645071007fd10e24fe1ea1ed.jpg"],[87643,"44\nand he beckoned with his hand to them to be quiet that they might not betray their position.  Wherefore then was that base slander ever allowed to be circulated that he was ensconced safely on an iron clad gunboat during the Battle of Malvern Hill.  A slander that was repeated by Senator Wilkinson of Minnesota in the senate of the N.J. Now there is but two ways about this matter either Wilkinson knew better and repeated what he knew to be a lie or He knew nothing about it and yet told it for a truth.  My humble oppinion is this. that cowardly congressmen were the cause of the war and that brave men have since become the victims of their slander.  Because I say these things from a sense of justice I do not wish to be classed among the old democrats.  No! Empath__ I am an abolitionist of the John Brown school. I believe Slavery to be a \"League with the Devil and a covenant with hell.\"  I hate all monarchies and aristocracies. I am for universal enfranchisement. Gen. McClellan is naturally an aristocrat a lover of slavery and a stickler for so called democratic party, And therefore I reckon him as a hindrance to the world. But of his personal bravery there can be no doubt.  I presume he loves his country some.  But not as a commander of its armies should love it.\nBut to return to my narrative, I said we lay all day in safety as the enemy did not attach our part of the lines. We could hear the battle raging on the right where the wicked and fool hardy Magruder was charging his corps of 40000 men over a field a mile and a half wide against a great mass of artilery supported by Porter with 18000 infantry, while the gunboats(?) had an enfilading fire on his entire force with their heavy metal. such slaughter has rarely been known in the history of war. The Federal infantry","17632a2964bc27d4435e3bdf0b554771.jpg"],[87644,"45\nwere hardly required to fire a gun.  Well did the poet express it\n\"A furious charge was by Magruder led\nWhich strewed the plain with myriads of the dead\"\nAnd yet Porter, who had won such immortal honors this day, like Benedict Arnold played the part of a traitor. or what was no better disobeyed his commander and caused the defeat of the armies of his country.  The Battle continued until late in the night the enemy suffered a terrible repulse. Which with a reinforcement and which I believe it might have reached us by that time had Burnsides Corps been ordered to our support / might have been turned into a ruinous defeat. But it is a question in my mind whether Gen. McClellan could have pushed the enemy even if he had been reinforced. On the morning of thd 1st of July the rain pouring down in torrents we moved from Malvern Hill and retreated to Harrison's Landing eight miles below. Here we massed on an immense field. We were scattered apart so that it was some time before every soldier found his regt. I took a good Ague shake. Decker my noble comrade walked a three miles to get a couple of sheaves of wheat to make a bed. As we had thrown everything away at White Oak Swamps. We had nothing but one little piece of shelter tent and a little thin blanket which we had picked up at Malvern Hill.  But another soldier belong to the Co. had a good blanket and two pieces or shelter tent with these we made a tent, and made a bed of the wet straw. I lay between the other boys that night sweat well and that was the last chill.  We remained on this ground until the 3d of July. When we moved out about a mile from the river and went into camp on a piece of ground which was nothing else but a gravel bed on the surfface but we never dug more than two or three feet without coming to water, and miserable water","a4b71ebb185a74682642d7a76d735cc5.jpg"],[87645,"46\nit was.  We were now worn to mere skelitons. Fatigue parties were detailed every day to build fortifications until no human power could hope to attack us with the least hope of success.  Sickness was prevalent to an alarming extent. And the dead march was heard sounding in almost every camp and at almost all hours of the day.  And its solemn music told us of those who had answered to the last earthly roll call. And next the parting salute told that their remains were laid in their last resting place.  \n\"These were the times that tried mens souls.\"  And many very many cursed the land that gave them birth. But now the news reached us of the 300,000 call for three years men, their(?) of a call for 300,000 men for 9 months.  This sounded like we were in earnest it just suited my views only I wished it had been 1,000,000 men for during the war long or short. My Brothers Pelatiah and Hezekiah had both been talking about enlisting and I had heretofore opposed it. But I now wrote that if they desired to enlist I had no objection.  My whole desire now was to see the people of the North act like men.  I often thought to myself that in the people of the North were what I would like to see them in twenty four hours after these calls had reached the extremities of the nation, they would both be filled.  But I soon learned that the rest of mankind was not so enthusiastic as I was.  But Pelatiah and Hezekiah both immediately entered the service.\nOn the 3d of August we moved out on a reconnoissance to Malvern Hill, had a slight skirmish with the enemy, remained until the 6th and returned to camp.  When we returned we found some of the boys who were wounded and taken prisoners on the seven days fight in camp they had been exchanged. One whose name is Calvin P. Clark had been shot in the chest within half inch of his heart yet he was now able to take the field only a little more than a month after receiving his wound.  About this","a394bc7cd98cd5bcdf5eeae07b4de5b5.jpg"],[87646,"47 \ntime also Capt. Colville returned to the Company.  Most officers with such a wound as his would have remained in idleness for months but that was not his disposition. We now made preparations to leave the Penninsula. On the 16th of August we marched from Harrison's Landing encamped that night near Charles City C.H.  As I said before nearly all the army was sick.  The prevailing disease was diarrhea. We now had an opportunity to get all the green corn peaches and apples that we could eat and we availed ourselves of this opening. \"Of course,\" you exclaim, \"You killed yourselves by eating.\"  You are wrong gentle reader. 'twas the best medicine I ever knew taken the army improved rapidly in health. But the[y] were so worn down and their hardships continuing that they did not many of them entirely recover until we went into winter quarters after the Battle of Fredricksburg.  We moved forward on the 17th passed the C.H. while we were halted here for a short time the boys broke into the building and scattered the records. some they carried away as memorials others they destroyed. One document was found signed by Patrick Henry, Several olf wills were found. Among the documents was one concerning a negroe who was hung sometime before the revolution for stealing a gallon of rum and this paper in relation to paying his master for him. One more sad relic of the inhuman barbarity of slavery. I tried hard to get possession of this document but the fortunate possessor would not part with it. On the night of the 17th we encamped on the Chickahominy and remained until morn of the 18th when we crossed in a pontoon bridge.  We lay here a while bathed and then moved forward in the direction of Williamsburg, where we arrived about noon the 20th we halted a few hours several of us went to visit Williams and Mary's College. but as it was locked and guarded we could only look at the out side. It","6e813a27aafcf81b8f75161b515674c4.jpg"],[87647,"48\nis a large old fashioned brick building. But I could see nothing about it worthy of particular remark. When we resumed our march we had an opportunity to observe Fort Magruder where our men were sadly butchered on the 5th of May. It is a large square fort and well protected from assault by fallen timber. We camped that night a short distance from Yorktown and remained the next day in that vicinity. When the tide was out we all went down to York river and dove for oysters. and the Cornucopia was in our camp. Oysters potatoes, peaches, apples, green corn and fresh pork. On the 22d we left camp and passing through York Town moved on in the direction of New Port M Newport News, we encamped that night near Big Bethel. And the next day reached Newport News. Here plenty still reigned. we followed diving for oysters as at Yorktown. On the 26th we embarked our brigade 2200 in number on the steam transport Mississippi. On the morn. of the 27th we steamed out and reached Aqua Creek where it was thought we would land about noon on the 28th. After some delay here we steamed on toward Alexandria but it was too late to get there that night and as the Captain was afraid to run his vessel after night we anchored till morning. We landed at Alexandria on the 29th. Went into camp about 3 miles west of the city and remained until the afternoon of the 30th. When we broke up camp and marching nearly all night rested a few hours just before day. then moved on to Chain Bridge. August. 31. We were here but a few hours when orders came for us to move to the support of Gen. Pope. Accordingly we set forward by way of the Old Fair State University marched till about 11 oclock that night then","056576ec31c0f5d4649b7113479e4ecc.jpg"],[87648,"49\nrested until 2 on the morn of the 1st of Sept. moved on to Centerville#. The 2d we went on a reconoisance and that night marched the entire night.  Rested a little while in the morning Sept. 3d and then formed in line of battle after which we went on picket.\nWe were now near Fair Fax C.H. Near the field were the lamented Kearny(?) fell on the previous day.  We remained here until about 4 oclock P.M. When we moved off towards the defenses of Washington.  We had but just started when the enemy's cavalry came out on the open ground in pursuit.  They followed up firing on our rear with two pieces of flying artilery. We returned/retreated(?) about two miles. Our regt. with the pieces of a Rhode Island battery being in the rear. Coming to a convenient woods Col. Sully formed the regt. which had now been reinforced by nearly all the stragglers. We waited behind a fense in the edge of the woods until our two pieces went to the rear and found a good position by this the rebel cavalry were within a short distance just out of musket range. not liking to try us on they wheeled their guns in position and opened on us. Col. Sully now gave orders for us to disperse and run. we did so in the wildest confusion imaginable. The rebels supposed we were panic stricken, but they knew little of their real situation. When we had reached the open ground near our battery. Our Cols voice rang out, \"Fall in men!\"  Well was that order obeyed and in one minutes time every man was in his place the two pieces of artilery were planted in the road. We formed one wing of the\n\nWhen we arrived at Centerville there were but 180 men out of 500 which belonged to the regt which had not straggled. And our regt. had more men present than any brigade in the corp.","9ac7dc01cf582ad4ad3d708a77dd7d2a.jpg"],[87649,"50\nregt to the right the other to the left. the regt. was formed line a V embracing the road the artilery was at the angle pointing directly down the road. We were on the rise of a little hill (known as Flint Hill) covered with a thick brushy woods, and open field in front of us. The following is a rude diagram of the scene of action. It was now quick dark and the advance of the rebel Cavalry came dashing out onto the open ground across the little break and into the lions jaws.  When this(?) arrived(?) squadrons were fairly within our embrace. Col. Sully halted them. At the same time speaking to us in a low voice \"Ready Men.\" They halted but their parley was short. The boys thinking that the Col. gave the order fired.  A voley. A few of the rebels fired.  But seemed to do it on the run. the most disorderly retreat imaginable followed their post.  They fled as fast as their horses could carry them. But there were many who never fled from that field and their graves are a monument to the military skill of Sully.  But sader events were to occur before we should again behold the rising sun.  It was a short time after midnight. When as we were marking along in seeming security, and indeed we were secure so far as any rebels were concerned some Cavalry got frightened at something a head and wheeling around dame dashing down through the infantry which being nearly asleep from fatigue although we were marching, also took the alarm and supposing that the cavalry was rebels, parted and springing into the woods on each side of the road, some of the men were foolish enough to fire on the cavalry which supposing they were in rebel ranks drew their revolvers and returned the fire.","40cc27517eae54a843f6eb87e158130c.jpg"],[87650,"51\nThus perished quite a number of both infantry and Cavalry. IN our regt. one officer and one man was killed.  And several men were wounded. However we moved on to the vicinity of the Chain Bridge where we rested for a few hours then crossed the river and encamped near Tenally Town in Maryland.  From this place we moved on and encamped near Rockville. This camp was Named Camp Defiance. The rebels now being in Maryland with a large army. Gen. McClellan was again appointed to the commnd of the army. And the army though work to mere skeletons felt confident of victory when they learned that their favorite was to lead them. I record this merely as a historical fact without comment. Perhaps the boys were wrong mayhap they were right. But this is the way they received the news of his appointment. Pope had left the army, a mere mob of stragglers McClellan collected them as speedily as possible, and moved against the enemy.  But this army weak and worn reeled against each other in the ranks few were fit to be out of the hospital. These are facts, undeniable facts. Facts that like the evidence against Capt. Wurtz have thousands of witnesses who will testify as I have written it. From these facts I have formed an opinion whether it be correct or not I leave impartial history to deside/decide.  But the opinion is this: That Gen. McClellan took ten thousand men into the Battle of Antietam. That under any other General would have fallen out and went to the hospitals. Nevertheless I ask no one to accept my opinion for truth. But I intend that what I write down here as known to me, shall be true as Holy Writ. But being failed to do it in its place I will here fire a word of con-","b7e67289ef13757aa140205c2dfd13f0.jpg"],[87651,"52\ndemnation.  Gen. McClellan (according to Hallecks official report) at the time Pope was fighting with the hordes of rebels at Brister Thoroughfare gap, Gainsville, and Bull Run, when ordered by Hallack to move to his support returned to that General which suited him, namely \"Place the army of the Potomac in the defenses of Washington, let Pope get out of his scrape.\"  My God??? is is possible that any one leaving a commission in the United States army, could ever thing of that as anything but  the nations scrape, as though Gen. Pope was the only one interested, this shows Gen. McClellan to lack that devoted patriotism which an officer in the army ought to possess.  But allow me here to say that Gen. McClellan, was in this respect just like nine tenths of the officers in our army. Devoted patriots were, and are, as scarce as hens teeth, not only among officers but also among privates. \nWe set out from Rockville about the 10 of September. We necessarily moved slowly, nevertheless we expelled the enemy from Maryland and Pennsylvania in the remarkably short period of eight days. On the 11th we first saw the enemy on the 12th we followed as far as the little village of Havana(?) with the infantry and the cavalry drove the rebels out of Fredrick City. On the 13th the infantry moved beyond Fredrick City and the Cavalry fought the rebels in the Katackitin [Catoctin?] mountains. On the 14th the infantry came up with the enemy at South mountain. We marched all day in hearing of the battle. About 2 oclock we reached the summit of the Katacktin mountains and looking across the valey we could see the battle raging on South mountain 6 miles distant. I believe I never saw a spot of earth that will compare in beauty with Mideltown Valey, as seen from the mountains. Its meadows, cultivated fields, and lovely groves, its streams bordered by sycamores to trace their varied windings, I beheld with the most ecstatic joy. \n\"There is not in this wide world a valley so sweet.\"","1c632fd5afda95acbb3492199e9bc2c0.jpg"],[87652,"53\nBut peal on peal from the distant mountain tells us War is there with all his murderous ruin.  He respecteth not the lovely or the beautiful. And here that relentless Demon stands. \"With eye that scratcheth all it looks upon.\" Oh! Detested War, leave our land and return no more.  Come not again to desolate our homes with thy unrighteous tread.  Come no more to desecrate our sepulchers; to burn the habitations of our people; to hew down our groves; to fill our land with mourning; and with thy blood stained hands to mar the beauteous face of nature.  The smoke rose thick and heavy on the side of the distant mountain, and shells were bursting over its summit. We descended into the valey. Twas dark as we approached the foot of the other mountain. Into a deep vale we descend down, down till it seemed we would never reach the bottom, and now we are beneath the battle.  Not a sound is heard# but the flash of artilery plays light lightning on the mountains brow, And muskets like fire flies in sparkling in its forests.  From the depths of the valey we began the ascent of the mountain just as the firing ceased. We are now passing a hospital and hear the groans\n\nWhen we were at Frederick City 13 miles distant we could distinctly hear the battle, and when we were on the Katochtin mountains 6 miles distant we could even hear the musketry. But when we were not more than a mile from field almost under it we could not hear a gun. There is a great deal in the nature of the atmosphere and in the situation about hearing sounds. The first day of the Battle of Gettysburg while marking towards the field we could not hear a gun though not more than 6 miles distant. While on the 3d day of July in the same battle the guns were heard twas said 115 miles distant.  I have frequently known of cannon being fired withing two miles and not a sound could be heard. At Coal Harbor VA in '64 the rebels shelled us with a mortar and we never heard the firing of the piece.","abb90717923e973c95b9cca242299b83.jpg"],[87653,"54\nof the poor wounded men ascending to heaven as solemn testimony against war. We had proceeded but a few paces further when we met a body of cavalry the commander ordering the infantry to \"give way and let the body of Gen. Reno pass. [\"]  These words found their way to the heart of many a soldier Gen. Reno is no more, I never had seen the man but his fame was fair and I felt depressed when these words told me he was no more.  I reflected he went into battle but a few hours ago. Where is he now?  Perhaps I go into battle tomorrow?  Where will I be tomorrow night?  These reflections are such as visit a soldier. On the march, in camp, on picket, at all times but in time of battles then he has something else to think about besides dying.  We moved up and relieved Gibbons brigade of the 1st Corps / better known as the \"Iron Brigade.\"# \"Which had this day done mad and fantastic execution.\"  We stood on the front line during the night behind a stone wall from which the old Iron Brigade had just expelled the rebels, expecting the battle to be renewed at the dawn of day. But when daylight came and Co. L advanced as skirmishes they reached the top of the mountain but found no enemy. We remained for a few hours in the place where were while some cavalry hurried to the front, and the 1st Corps moved on again. Here for the first time I went to look at a battle field. I had seen many but non had I visited out of idle curiosity but having time now I strayed over this scene of human slaughter. If any mans heart swells with ungodly pride let him visit one battle field and if he is not humbled then he is past all cure. I looked on the pale corpes(corpses) and asked \"Am I indeed to come to this.\" The answer was but too plain, \"Aye even as these\n\nThis brigade consisted of the 2nd, 6th, and 7th Wisconsin and the 19th Indiana.","28a17f0a47723d137f561fb62fd30737.jpg"],[87654,"55\nshalt thou be.\"\nWhat has man to pride himself upon?  To day he is, and tomorrow he is food for worms.  I saw here a rebel sergeant siting pale and gastly leaning against a rock. I though he was wounded and approached to offer him help. He was dead.  He died like a brave man with his face to the foe.  Probably his friends never knew the manner of his death or the last resting place of his body.\nWe now moved on in pursuit of the enemy. Our cavalry was picking up many stragglers. At Boonsboro there were about four hundred rebel prisoners. It was nearly night when we came up to the rebel position, separated from them by Antietam Creek and its valey. We took position and remained there during that night and the following day.#  Heavy cannonading continued all day on the 16th and in the evening Gen. Hooker attacked and drove the enemy's left back from the creek and took a position where he could cover the crossing of the whole right wing. Our Corps was under orders to be ready to charge at 2 p.m. but the attack was not made until the next morning.  Soon after day light on the morning of the 17th Gen. Hooker\n\nIt was while we lay at this camp that I found some leather and bringing it to camp. One of my comrades helped me cut it up into strings. he taking one and I one to tie around our limbs to stop the blood in case we should be wounded. In the battle he had his leg shot off by a cannon ball and on the following day I helped bury him and found the string tied around his leg, but it had proved ineffective in stopping the blood in such cases it is best to get hold of a stick or the ramrod of a gun and pass it through a loop in the string then twist it until it is sufficiently tight to stop the blood.","4aa5b649478524ab31c0e2d3ce431b4a.jpg"],[87655,"56\nWith his wonted vigor fell upon the rebels and drove them with terrible slaughter for the distance of a mile our Corps now moved forward to finish the work. We crossed Antietam Creek about 9 A.M. and moving forward in three lines of battle over the field where their hosts seemed to have all perished we passed through a woods in front of Hookers lines.  Here we found the rebels well posted and reinforced and the battle opened in good earnest. Our regt. being on the extreme right of the lines the right of it did not immediately come into action. But it was not many minutes before our left was compelled to give way. We could regt. affter regt. yield to our left and finaly we were compelled to about face and retreat which we did slowly, followed by a hallowing muntitude of what shall I call them? Most of the boys had thrown off their knapsacks at the outset but remembering White Oak Swamp I would not part with mine. We soon had a fense to climb and the balls were singing as cheerfully as one could wish.  The fense was stake and rider. I attempted to go between the main fense and rider but my knapsack caught on the rider.  It therefore required a second movement and I went over the fense, but I confess that the delay was more than I wished at that time.  Just after passing the fense we halted# faced the enemy and fought for a few minutes untill they run a battery out on our right flank their having a cross fire we were compelled to retreat.\n\nIt was here that my file leader Marcelus B. Milligan was killed, leaving Marion Abbott as my file leader. It was also at this minute that David Abbott's leg was taken off by a cannon ball. The same who helped me cut strings to bind up wounds.","f14a3d12e519f872b40b0d9928a12abc.jpg"],[87656,"57\nfarther!  We fell back about eighty rods farther where we had some artilery the enemy were repulsed and driven back to their original position behind the woods and we retired behind our artilery to support it. The rebels now tried artilery. All was quiet: and one unaccustomed to battle fields would have thought the battle ended many citizens had made their appearance. And the boys were remarking that some of those citizens would learn a lesson before night.  Sudenly the rebels opened several batteries# on us. I verily thought some of the boys would die laughing to see the civilians run one took refuge by a tree close to our regt. The boys told him that a shell would go through the tree without knowing it was there. So he started for the rear but not gone ten paces before a shell passed over his head and bursted just a little in advance of him. He stopped.  (Some of the boys said afterwards that he looked six ways for Sunday).  The boys bauled at his to to on and keep right in the road of that shell for no two ever when in the same place.  This seemed to bring him to his senses and he made good time over the hill and out of our sight.  Let us hope that reached a place of safety.  If he did I will warrant he never visited a battle field again until the fighting was over.\nAs we had twenty six pieces of artilery on the hill where we were posted the rebel batteries were soon silenced.  And this was the battle of Antietam so far as the right wing was concerned, but the left under the ever faithful Burnside gained more\n\nDuring the heaviest of this firing Gen. McClellan was near us I never seemed to know that the enemy were firing And yet this man is reported to have never been under fire. But \"The mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceiptful were opened against him.\"","6ed334fe40bad132c71df57871e7a8c1.jpg"],[87657,"58\nground. But as that is in history and did not come under my own observation I have nothing to do with it.  Night came on and the firing died away. \nAll day the 18th we lay in line of battle and did nothing.  This I cannot sanction and shall not attempt to defend. I have no defense to offer for Gen. McClellan only where I think he is wronged.  On the 19th we advanced but found that the \"Bird had flown.\"  And the bloody field was ended with no particular advantage to either side, unless the driving of the enemy from our own soil might be considered an advantage.  They left in our hands about 5,000 prisoners, 39 stands of colors, and 13 pieces of artilery. We rested on the field untill the 22d when we marched to Harpers Ferry.#  The day was hot and a hard march we had of it. As the bridge had been destroyed we forded the river and ascending Bolivar Heights the army of skeletons at last rested.  Just 6 months this day we had left this same place and I weighed at\n\nOn the 15th of Sept. Gen Miles commanding Wis. forces at Harpers Ferry surrendered to the Rebel Gen. Stonewall Jackson the forces under his command amounting to 11,000 men and 70 pieces of artilery, besides more than a milion dollars worth of property. He first evacuated Maryland Heights which commanded the county in every direction for miles around. He then evacuated London Heights which was the next highest position, and then he left Bolivar Heights and retreated into the town of Harpers Ferry which is situated in a valey entirely surrounded by the three heights which I have mentioned.  This was evidently treason. It could not have been a lack of judgment for any boy twelve years old would have posted his men on Maryland Heights and defied 100,000 men.","3c428b055430e2b763e07d2bac6d444b.jpg"],[87658,"59\ntime 196 lbs But now I would not have weighed 140. Here we had opportunities to bathe and wash our clothes and have new clothing for many of us were barefooted and without good clothing of any kind.  The weather was beautiful. And we did picket duty in lovely Shenandoah Valey. in that season of the year when fruits were ripe. Paw paws, grapes, nuts apples, and other vegetable productions were plentiful and as we received four months pay on the 8th of October we lived highly and improved some in health. We were reinforced by new troops daily arriving from the north. Among others the 19th Maine Infantry was added to our brigade. But how green they were one little circumstance will show.  At the time of the surrender and[an] impressive amount of ammunition had been scattered over the ground so that it was literally strewed shells. Some of the 19th thought they would make an excellent thing to set their cups on when they wanted to make coffee. accordingly they arranged their fire place of loaded shells, built their fire and set on their coffee.  Fortunately, just as they had commenced cooking evening retreat was sounded. While they were at roll call four of the shell burst in succession, unsettling their coffee and throwing the fire in every direction but injuring no one. But for the providential circumstance of being called to roll call there would probably many of them perished.  You may well guess that they never took shells to build fires on after that.  Nor did they ever hear the last of that one green caper. My favorite walk while we were at","8d17846167bf9c398207d5c11c01634c.jpg"],[87659,"60\nHarpers Ferry was to ascend Bolivar Heights and view the beautiful Valey of the Shenandoah as its golden verdure lay spread like a rich carpet at my feet.  Any one who has looked down from a mountain on the country below knows that however rough and uneven the country may be it has the appearance of a level plane.  It seemed strange to me as I looked over that valey that a spot so lovely could ever be the birth place of traitors. There is a cave under Bolivar Heights a party of us also visited it once we penetrated I think about the distance of 40 rods. It is a narrow dirty cave but in many places its rooms are very lofty.  Its Stalactites are not clear and beautiful like they are in some caves. But it has many springs of clear water. And in many places there are yawning cavities which are very deep.\nOn the 14th of Oct. an advance was made as far as Charlestown by way of reconoisance. Our regt. was in the advance on the right flank while the 53d Pennsylvania was on the advanced left. Col. Brooks of the 53d commanded the advance.  Lieut. Col. Morgan commanded our regt.  Col. Sully having been promoted to the rank of brigadier. Near the town of Charlestown the enemy opened a battery upon us, our battries replying soon silenced that of the enemy who displayed no force but cavalry and flying artilery. Our two advanced regts (1st Minn. and 53d Penn.) deployed and pushed back their cavalry which took good care to keep out of musket range.  They retired in splendid order just west of the town we found several hundred of them drawn up as if for a charge. We posted ourselves to repel it but they did not see fit to assail us and","cc05e3eddea24e45d31899e5599bc218.jpg"],[87660,"61\nI make no question but that it was a wise decision. For ere they would have broken our lines we could easily have annihilated the entire cavalry force of the rebel army.  And our skirmish line could have beaten all the force they there displayed.  There is much terror in the appearance of cavalry but experienced infantry can never be broken by double their number of cavalry if they charge mounted.  When we had made the necessary preparations we the skirmishers again advanced and the rebels retires firing only a few shots and wounding one of the 53d.  Just at night fall we entered a woods.  Here we picked up a stray rebel. It began to rain just after we posted in the woods.  Dark and stormy indeed was that night. I believe I never was in deeper darkness.  About 10 P.M. the order came to withdraw our pickets from the woods.  In attempting this we were lost and wandered from one part of the woods to another for over two hours our officers drumming on their swords to keep us together. At last we succeeded in getting out of the forest. Then the clouds cleared off and the stars shed their light upon us as if taunting us with out helpless condition without their aid.  We bivouacked on a hill near the town the cavalry doing picket duty while we rested.  We remained all day the 15th and until afternoon on the 16th. An aid rode up to Col. Morgan and greeted him with these words, \"Colonel, you had the advance coming out so the General has concluded to let you have the rear going back.\"  And so we covered the rear but the enemy did not attack us.  The result of the expedition may be summed up as follows.  We captured 90,000 bushels of wheat which the rebels had gathered into Charlestown and 200 sick men in the hospital were paroled.  Our loss did not exceed twenty men all told. Capt. Pell of Co. of our regt. and division provost marshall was desized(?) by a rebel woman and made prisoner in our own lines.  Oh! noble soldier! Yet this is but one instance of thousands which occurred in the army of officers disgracing themselves by associating with the rebel.","d711caecb0a8bdb5e6a813e69d595597.jpg"],[87661,"62\nharlots and allowing themselves to be captured and led to Richmond in triumph by a cunning foe who knew well how to take advantage of the effeminate weakness of his antagonist.  Oh! how such things did chill my heart.  How often have I cursed the luxuries of our nation and wished that we were like the Spartans of Yore.  Drinking, gambling, Debauchery, gold, and glittering shown. Seemed the universal delight of our officers.  How unlike true warriors!  Representatives of Sardinopolas and not of Leonidas.  How encouraging to a soldier who loves his country better than aught else he loves. I intend to write in a book which I shall call \"Corruptions of The Army\" a few hundred such instances as this which have come either directly under my observation or of which I have the best of authority of their authenticity.  But for the present I will proceed with my narrative.  Only detailing such things as may be read in company and leaving the grosser parts for my future pen.\nWe remained at Harpers Ferry until the 21st of Oct. when we moved on. Crossing the Shenandoah, we would round the base of London Heights. And moved slowly up London Valey. It was on the 4th of Nov. that my brother Hezekiah joined us. It was a pleasure and yet a fearful paid to meet him. Oh! how my heard did go out toward him. Methinks I had never know how I loved my brothers before. How sad and melancholy was our meeting. I felt from the bottom of my heart that we would never live through the war. I was work and weak and it saddened him to see me so. But Oh! I could see that his constitution would never bear him through the trials that lay before him. And yet the \"sweet council\" which we took together was a great relief to me. I had not found one soul","1a2f17653721abff92b3bb4efd6255e4.jpg"],[87662,"63\nwho could entirely appreciate the same feelings, joys, and sorrows, which were mine until he came to cheer me.  We had read the same books beat over the same fields of literature, and he had been my guide and patron from my earliest recollections. But through he could comprehend all my feelings I could not reach the boundless limits of his own.  His great mind swept over science as easily as the eagle soars the asme [same?] fields of heaven. Here I could not accompany him, and it grieved me, because I did so much love him, that I could not follow him through the intricate windings of sciences labyrinth.  But as I could not go with him he seemed willing to stay with me.  How often did we talk over our chances for success in the great struggle before us.  We looked with the same eye on the follies of our age.  We grieved alike that the spirit of exalted patriotism was so weak in our people.  That our officers were so fond of parade and show.  And that they cared so little for their country's welfare.  Certain pleasures there are which no individual that I have ever found (except my own brothers) could appreciate.  Oh the pleasure I take in their society where I know that any good word which I may drop will not fall on barren ground. And where the good words fall from their lips on my heart like rain on a thirsty land. Our joys. Our sorrows all alike and none can feel them but ourselves. I am glad it is so.  I am glad that the sweets of such society are withheld from me save when I am with those noble brothers. \nBut to return to my story. We proceeded next day and occupied Snickers gap. We remained there the next day and moved forward again in the direction of Warrentown. We marched all night nearly [stricken]\nA heavy rain storm set in. (I had just been reading J.S.C. Abbotts account of the campaign of HohenLinden [FRENCH REVOLUTION?]) and I could recognize","7d9a3884f2b6db6ce4cf68d5c0fec9c3.jpg"],[87663,"64\nthe resemblance between the seasons of the memorable battle and the one which was coming upon us.  I was impatient to inflict the traitors a defeat like that the Austrians received at Hoen Linden. We encamped in a woods pitched our shelter tents, built large fires before them and were as happy as a set of fellows as you would meet were you to travel a life time.  It was one of several occasions which will be remembered by any soldier who was priviledged to enjoy it. There are a few things which every one will naturally love for example to hear the patter of the rain on the roof when we go to bed. And this snow storm was enjoyed by all. And why?  Because our tents were sufficient protection from the snow our blankets were warm. The woods was deep and a sufficient protection from the winds that howled on the out side in their impotent rage.  It is an excellent and triumphant feeling to be snugly sheltered and defy the raging of the elements.\nWe left this place and marching all day and nearly all night encamped near Warrenton. The following day we passed through Warrenton and camped near the village.  It was here that Gen. McClellan left us also Gen. Porter left to stand his court marshal. Both were cheered lustily one was not a patriot the other was a traitor. So much for the common sense of a soldier and yet soldiers are as sensible as other men. And many of our little petty officers threatened seriously to resign.#  Oh! dreadful calamity!! a petty captain with no more sense than an intelligent baboon will resign if the government displeases his apeship. No doubt twenty privates in his company more capable of filling the position of a major general than he is that of a corporal. Yet \"I'll resign if Gen. McClellan is relieved.\"\n\nA good joke was perpetrated by Gen. Sully about this time. Some of the little petty officers were threatening to resign. When the general remarked that he would resign only he couldn't get his living without the aid of the government. But the petty officers were so dull of apprehension that they did not perceive the biting sarcasm of the old Veteran.","41fd3e3176700d810c07cf1814a46620.jpg"],[87664,"65\nUndoubtedly, the resignation of such an ape would ruin the armies of the nation.\nFinaly under our new commander, Burnside, we moved on to Fredericsburg. We arrived before the place on the 18th of Nov. and had matters been arranged as they ought to have been we might have crossed the river and taken possession of the heights with all ease but as usual there had been no unity of action arranged by our leaders. Halleck had not sent forward the pontoons so we could not cross. Halleck blamed Gen Miegs, and Miegs some one else, so as usual no one was responsible for this delay.  I know not who was to blame but so it was that we were delayed until the 11 of Dec. In the mean time my brother Hezekiah was taken very sick.  On the night of the 10th we had orders to be ready to cross the river a daylight next morn. And while it was yet dark the thundering of the Cannon and the reported crack of muskets told that work had begun. I went to the hospital tent and with all the air of cheerfulness I could command bid Hezekiah farewell. But how heavy my heart was can only be known by those who have seen like experience.\nOh! it is an awful sight a host arming for battle. The packing of knapsacks, the examination of cartridges, the ringing of the ramrods in the muskets to see that all is ready for the dread conflict, the orders of the officers. The hasty couriers and aids riding their horses to the utmost speed. The forming in ranks the right face, and forward march!!! All tell of the dead work to come. A dense fog","0f0252b5b5fe2e9ae827c904904a9470.jpg"],[87665,"66\ncovered the whole face of the country, and as we left our camp and descended into the Valey the bottom of which was obscured in fog, and the head of our column seemed to vanish into the fog and from the depths of the valey come the heavy roaring of artilery and all kinds of confused and horrid noises. It did seem that we were entering the \"drear[?] abodes\" of Pluto. We marched down and took position near the river prepatory to crossing and there remained until nearly dark while the continued peals from one hundred and forty pieces of artilery kept our minds continually on the works before us.  Just about sundown the 7th Michigan were ordered to cross in the face of the enemy and protect the Engineers in laying a bridge accordingly in open boats protected only by the rapid fire of our artilery they crossed and ascended the bank engaged the rebels which were posted in the town. The rest of their brigade quickly came to their support the bridge being laid and our brigade following formed on the wharf while the bullets sang musically over our heads. The 3d brigade# passed on through the town taking possession first of one house then of the next working their way as only veterans know how, taking advantages which a new recruit would not never see and finaly expelling the enemy from the town.  This was accomplished about 9 P.M. The firing had not ceased when the soldiers were pillaging the city.\n\nThis brigade consisted 7th Michigan 42d N.Y. and 19th and 20th Massachusettes.","06523b7cec512cdcbd349ba3c3b081e5.jpg"],[87666,"67\nThe houses of the wealthy chicaliers fell a prey to the \"Vandal foe.\" And truly the rebel papers were not far from right when they characterised us as Vandals.  But they were as great barbarians as we and consequently had no right to complain.  Books of every description were found and duly scattered some were carried off in triumph by the lucky captors but others were wantonly torn and trampled under foot by men who could no more appreciate the value of a book that could the cock that of the jewel which he found in the dunghill.  For my part I secured a copy of \"Campbels Pleasure of Hope\" and a small \"History of Rome.\" And Decker saved an abridgement of Blairs Lectures which he presented to me for a \"New Years Gift.\"  Fine musical instruments shared the fate of the literature.  A piano worth $500 was wantonly beat with the butt of a soldier's musket.  Whiskey, wine, ale, beer, and brandy, being plenty men were soon drunk, find silk dresses being plenty men were soon dressed for the \"ball.\" As violins were cheap we had no lack of music. And when our disguised ladies were ready the sets were formed the midnight rebel[revel?] begun, Ladies and gentleman musicians and waitors[?] alike were drunk.  \"Honors all!\" and the dance begins. O! mortal man! Why art thou so nearly allied to demons?  Why at this sacred hour when all nature is sleeping?  Why when honesty deems it right to rest wilt thou act like a fiend, witch, ghoust, or ghoul at this sacred hour with more than hellish revelry. I could always dead the disturbance of the night. That time when even the lower animals become quiet, except","44f71d81f7e64e3a84bbca592df69ccc.jpg"],[87667,"68\nsuch as are deemed of evil portent.  Cats, owls, rats, bats, and vampires have ever been supposed by the superstitious to be possessed of evil spirits. Why is this?  Just because they are night revelers. Then why will man choose this hour for noisy sport and merriment? Just because he is more nearly allied to owls and vampires than he is to lambs.  But \"On with the dance, let joy be unconfined.\"  But the General unceremoniously invades this \"Innocent pasttime.\"  Warns them of the morrow tells them our work is not yet done, the enemy may attack us at any minute.  Vain[?] labor, the dance is stopped; but this revel continues, great questions of Law, Politics, Science and Literature are treated with that classic eloquence and consistent logic which can only be commanded by a drunken man.  A militia company's uniform is found, soldiers change their modest regulation caps for the more showy cranial covering of the band box militia.  A continental cocked hat bearing a date greatly anterior to the revolution is found. And private Thomas Whetstone of Co. C. a man of extraordinary talent but one who lives in open defiance of God, man or devil, placing it on his head assumes command of the division and proceeds to lay before his officers. (Private Calvin Clark of Co. F., Sergt. Farewell of A. and several others all men of talent but wrecks in moral principle) the plan of attack.  It is done in Language, and look and gesture that would not disgrace Caesar. And I ___ [verily?] believe that for the plan itself, had Gen. Burnside heard and adopted it,","b189bbdbda2802cfd2949e868644710e.jpg"],[87668,"69\nwe would have dislodged the enemy from their position. \"Seigals Corps\" said he \"is now crossing at Banks[?] Ford. I am only making a feint in this direction. I intend for all the forces but  the second Corp to cross alone here, and then I shall withdraw the Second Corps and send it to the support of the rest of the army.  It would be extreme folly for me to attempt to charge those heights.\"  This is not exactly the language of Gen. Whetstone, but this was the purport of this speech which of course was highly approved by Gen'ls Clark and Farewell.  Feather beds were brought out and laid in the dirt and men laid down to sleep; but no sleep was there the revelers forbid it.  We feasted on the good things of the city.  Who after reading what I have written will dare to say that we are not entitled to rank as first class barbarians?  If any man says we are not, I say he has been misinformed as to the nature of a barbarian. I have not written the tenth part of what occurred within my own observation, and I aw but a very small part of the transactions. Before this time I supposed I knew very nearly what war was. But I found that my imagination was too weak to conceive of the revel in which soldiers indulge when sacking a city. And when I come to treat[?] of prison life, it will be seen that this performance left room for farther experience.  Well, morning dawned and moving out we formed picket lines in the outskirts of the town. All seemed remarkably quiet the rebels showing very little force and not firing a gun. The sun shines brightly but the weather is cool. Our company is on picket.  Being near a house and feeling a little hungry we build a fire and begin to help ourselves, a band down by the river is cheerfully discussing \"Bully for You.\"","7eee4a1653b16b02a4f211fd9a60ae0d.jpg"],[87669,"70\nWhen Bang! Bang!! Bang!!! The rebel artilery on Mayre's Heights begins to send us unwelcome messengers who bring us tidings unpleasant to our ears.  \"Bully for you\" suddenly ceases we leave our cooking and spring to our posts but scarcely are we out of the house when a shell passes through it just where we had but a minute before been sitting.  We had very little rest for the remainder of that day, the rebels keeping up a continued shelling.  About 9 P.M. we were relived from picket and posted in a house where we slept very well, on good beds.  Early next morning 13th the fight began in earnest our company was ordered on picket to the right of the town where we remained during the battle exposed to a heavy fire of artilery but out of musket range.  Lieut Ball took post in a house where he could observe the movements of the enemy. And ordered Berdan and me to remain with him while the rest of the company was deployed as skirmishers along an old fence row.  Ball and Berdan went up into the upper story of the house to keep watch while I remained below to give notice if any messenger should come to the picket line. I was standing inside of the building looking out at a window, when the Lieutenant ordered me to take a post just outside, that I might see more readily if any one should some.  I had scarcely taken the new position assigned me, and was leaning against the wall of the house not more than four feet from where I was before when a shell passed right exactly where I had left, covering me with brick dust and stunning me so much that, although another shell passed nearly in the same place directly afterwards, I knew nothing of it. The first idea that stuck me was that the Lieutenant and Berdan were both killed but they were","171558c61bde719d9262502d2eff08ab.jpg"],[87670,"71\nneither of them hurt the shell having passed under them.  These repeated escapes together with other circumstances conspired to give me serious thoughts. Could all these things happen by chance? Impossible!  I shall perhaps ere I close my book narrate many other such instances, therefore shall not say much on the subject, but only suggest to the reader that it would be worth his while to notice these repeated instance of what I believe to be nothing less than divine interposition.  If it had been but one instance I might have passed if off as the mere work of chance but when repeated more than a score of times it certainly cannot be thus lightly avoided. Hundreds of pieces of artilery played during the day. One of the most annoying features of the thing was that our batteries had been supplied with defective shell so that they fell among out own men. Charge after charge was made by our men on those heights.  \"But vain was their color, and their courage vain.\"  They were repulsed and slaughtered like sheep. Night comes on and the firing dies away, all the artilery is now hushed save one enormous gun on Mayers Heights, which from time to time like an angry serpent darts forth its tongue of fire, and the course of its furious missile is marked by a streak of fire from its burning fuse down it descends into the city and a heavy report tells that the fire has reached its explosive contents. A few minutes elapse and the monster speaks again and again is the face of the sky marked by a streak of glaring fire.  But on the 30th discharge busts[?] with its own rage.  No more guns fired during that night.","805925a25c97a60c893e8942eaf59a18.jpg"],[87671,"72\nBerdan and I stood picket and relieved each other every two hours as nearly as we could guess.  The weather was bitterly cold. I was unwell and my sufferings were intense. But morning came at last and we were relieved from picket and went down into the center of town where we enjoyed ourselves for a few hours as well as could be expected with a hundred pieces of artilery heaving on us at a range of not more than three fourths of a mile. Yet for some reason unknown to me they did not see  fit to open on us but would only occasionally send us a shell to let us know we were not forgotten. But  after dark we were again ordered on picket.  This time on the battle field where the charges were made on the previous day. going on the out post I was again obliged in the quiet stillness of the night to listen to the heartrending cries of poor wounded men. As I have before remarked the weather was very cold. Ant there were men lying with limbs torn from their bodies, on the cold damp lap of Earthe, and the icy grasp of winter was freezing their blood as it flowed from the shattered fragments of their mutilated members. Go my friend in the full bloom of health, go when the northern winds of Winter howl in their demonic rage and the streams are bound and the earth made hard by his hoary frosts, Go lay one hour on the naked earth without covering. Or try the pain of a limb torn from the body on the balmiest days of, happy May. Then let thy heart melt in tenderest pity for him who lone and far from friends must lay with gaping horrid wounds.","6d22b6bcf9e106a3732860a1925d066d.jpg"],[87672,"73\narms or leg or entrails torn by ugly missiles on the cold earth in winter not one hour alone but for days if he survives so long, melt thou in pity, and prize forever, highly prize the boon that has cost so much suffering.  Who after these reflections will say there is glory in war?  After standing two hours I was relieved and laid down to sleep. But scarcely had I done so when the rebels fired on us disturbing my repose.  When all had become quiet I laid down a second time but again I was aroused this time by our own officers to work on a rifle pit which we must make to cover us before another day. Therefore no more sleep was vouched safed [?} that night. As soon as it was light the rebel skirmishers opened fire upon us but laying close in our pits we were in no great danger. And we could if we desired have send them messengers fully as unwelcome to them as theirs were to us. But sensible men do not deem it worth their while to be annoying poor wretches at long range, and murdering men for no possible good.  But about noon we were subject to missiles which were far more disagreeable. For from a hill about a mile distant from the right flank of our Regt. the enemy had a battery posed in such a manner as to completely enfilade us and this opened.  A green Regt. the 127th Pennsylvania# which was posed immediately to the right of us fled in wild disorder leaving our flank exposed of course the rebel skirmishers increased their fire we expected to be attacked immediately but we held our position for which we were complimented by the commanding General, Shully([?]\n\nA ludicrous scene occurred shortly after this stampede. One of the officers of the 127th was seen crawling along as though his leg was broken some of the stretcher bearers came along with a stretcher and were about to pick him up and carry him off the field when to their great surprise he jumped up and run for dear life back into the city. Some of the boys declared that he did not cross the canal on the bridge but cleared it at a single bound.","6e3333994f355173dcdaf1078ba0e7eb.jpg"],[87673,"74\nafter we were deserted on the right a shell struck in the embankment which we had thrown up in front of us. Had it exploded it must have half the company.  Nevertheless the enemy did not see fit to attack us and we were not likely to attack them after the bitter lessons of the 13th. The welcome ring of night overspread the earth the firing died away. And about 11 Oclock P.M. we were called in and retreated across the river and after a good deal of trouble most of us reached our former camp.  That night and laying down slept like logs not withstanding a December rain was pouring upon us in torrents.  Thus closed one of the most disastrous battles of the war. The loss in our regt. was 19 men wounded most of them slightly.  I found Hezekiah still in the regimental hospital and very sick. the hospital was a miserable uncomfortable concern and I had no way in the world to help him to a better situation.  I could only relieve him slightly by seeing that his washing was attended to and trying to cheer him all I could.  I was sick myself which made it worse for both of us. I had now been afflicted with the Diarrhea for about nine months. I suddenly began to have an appetite for rice which I used for nearly my whole sustenance for about two weeks in Jan. 1863 in which time I gained 31 lb in weight. I now began to feel like myself again. My blood flowing freely I again felt confident of the ultimate success of our armies. And the dark foreboding which had hung like a pall over my heart for many months was dispelled. I felt again that I could war if war I must for twenty years against the enemies of my country.  We had but miserable poor quarters this winter owing to the scarcity of timber. Our quarters consisted of a hole dug in the ground a shelter tent","fd46de4ad301beed5689929779f0bb62.jpg"],[87674,"75\npitched over it. a fire place dug out in one side with a little low chimney build over it. In this place Decker and I spent our leisure time, playing chess, reading, and criticizing Blair's Lectures, studying Towns Analysis of the English Language. We also read Campbells Pleasures of Hope and several novels.  I have not spoken of a certain peculiarity in my mind at or about this time.  That I was subject to fits of most violent anger. So that at times I came very near striking my officers over the head with my gun. I could not control myself at all. On one occasion when Decker and I were playing at chess one of these fits seized me and I knocked the board and men all over the tents. This lasted me until in the spring I began to carefully read in the New Testament. and I have led a happier life from that day to this.\nAgain we had orders to be ready to move at daylight. But a heavy rain set in which entirely forbade an advance. Several Corps had already moved but were compelled to return, and a more dreary, worn, and miserable looking set of men I have rarely seen. Heavy details were made from some of the regts. to help draw the artilery out of the mire.  This campaign was known in army parlance as \"Burnside Stuck in the Mud.\"  Soon after this Burnside was relieved and Fighting Joe Hooker assumed command of the Army of the Potomac.  In his order assuming command occurred a passage something like this:  \"Let us not hesitate to fight the enemy wherever we can find him.\"  I suggested to some of my comrades that in all probability we could find him.  Our new commander immediately took measures to reform the cavalry arm of the service and indeed he soon rendered it the most efficient branch of the service.  He swore with horrid oaths that he would show the infantry a dead cavalry mean","5bae47502c363e6616beb1b55b2d116b.jpg"],[87675,"76\nand he kept his word. I had now been eighteen months in the army and one year active service and had not yet seen a dead cavalryman but there was no scarcity of them in the army from that time forward, and Pleasanton, Buford, Killpatric and Greg soon were wearing laurels brighter than ever had circled the brows of Ashby, Stewart, Fitzhugh, Lee, or Hampton. In the latter part of April the army began its third movement of the Corps. moved up the river and crossed at the upper fords.  But the 6th Corp and our division / the 2d of the 2d army corps. remained where we were.  About the 28th of April the battle commenced up the river.  The 29th the artilery played quite heavily. the 30th we could hear heavy firing nearly all day. The first of May the battle was evidently raging with great fury. On the 2d of May I went on picket. And it was a continuous roar of artilery and even the musketry could be heard though indistinctly. Night came on, a light moonlight night. The battle was not suspended, but the firing sounded nearer.  The soldiers jumped at the conclusion that Hooker was driving the enemy before him toward the river and we would remain there and prevent their crossing. And the rebel army would be ruined.  Hooker stock run up to $1.60 and was readily taken at that enormous advance.  I was hopeful but if I remember right I was not overly elated.  Early on on the morning of the 3d Gen Sedgwick crossed the river below the town and our division crossed into the town. McClaus rebel division held the heights above the city. Our division moved out the the","fa4f24b61d301b1c93ea4562567028cc.jpg"],[87676,"77\nright of the town making the rebels deploy their column to prevent us from charging the heights in that quarter we could see their column move along in their pits and as they had the inside track on us they easily reached the bank of the river where the heights run up to the stream before we could get there. Meanwhile they opened a battery upon us which rendered it somewhat disagreeable remaining about that quarter, we therefore lay down in a rifle pit which they had dug along the river bank. The enemy then brought a battery around to our right flank and opened a brisk fire upon us but our batteries along Stafford Heights replied.  Meanwhile Sedgewick formed his columns the old Ron Brigade in front the general leading in person charged. And sweeping up the heights in the face of a terrible fire of musketry and artilery loaded with canister drove the rebel artilery men from their guns nine of which he captured and several hundred prisoners pursued them about 3 miles. While we (our division) first moved up onto Mayiers Heights and then returned, recrossed the river and took a position for watching the enemy lest they should make a raid in our rear.  No sooner were the heights carried than our Engineers were at work rebuilding the railroad bridge.  Gen. Sedgwick retained possession of the heights until on the morn of the 4th of May a rebel column was seen creeping up the river along the base of the heights in his rear, cutting his communication with us and they were quickly in possession of the heights in his rear. It was probably here that Gen. Sedgewick displayed the qualities of a great commander more conspicuously than on any other occasion during his brilliant career. Gen. Lee stated that he attacked Sedgewick with his whole army excepting two divisions. yet this","3ce02317b0780584a26ce3713244858e.jpg"],[87677,"78\nhero with a single corps which did not number 15,000 battled with him for 12 hours nearly incessantly, retiring in good order five miles to Banks Ford retreated across the river in the face of a veteran army, victorious, valiant, overwhelming in numbers, and commanded by one of the ablest generals the world has ever produced, bringing off all his artilery, ambulances, nearly off of his wounded and 1200 prisoners. Honor, forever, be to the 6th Corp. and Gen. Sedgewick. And yet this man refused the command of our armies when it was offered him, and when by seniority he was entitled to it.  Hooker stock was on the decline, sellers gladly disposed of it at 50 ct. on the dollar and buyers gambled at that price.  I believe the army had all retired across the river by the 5th of May. We settled down in a pleasant camp near the river where the green clover grew most luxuriously and all nature smiled as if to relieve our heavy hearts from the mortification of defeat. We cleaned all rubbish from the face of the country. And in a few days, any one would have thought by the countenances of the soldiers that we were the most victorious army upon which the sun had ever shown.#  We built nice arbors over our camp lined our streets with pine trees arched the entrance of each street with evergreens. mande(made?) the letter of each companies street of evergreens and hung it at the arch. and thus Hookers army as the newspapers sparingly expressed it \"Went into summer bowers.\"  This is the thanks that a soldier receives by those for whom he\n\nWhile we were in this camp the 34th N.Y left us, their term of service having expired. It was a noble regt. and fought faithfully by our sides ever since the Battle of Ball Bluff.","254db2f12818a47fddba5f112085fe41.jpg"],[87678,"79\nsuffers the most agonizing pains and endures the greatest hardships. 15,000 men in that army had lately[?] bled in a vain endeavor to dislodge the enemy from his strong position, had fought a nine days battle; had captured nine guns 15 colors and 5,000 prisoners, and yet they were unsuccessful and consequently deserved nothing but sneers from the carpet knights, who fight battles on paper and take cities on maps.  But let sneers be what they may.  That army that at that time went into Summer bowers was one of the best that ever the sun shone upon.  I do not intend that my simple assertion shall be taken for proof in this case but I shall attempt the narration of a campaign which, if gentle reader you will lay all prejudice aside, and read the truth I believe will fully confirm what I have said.  The assertion which I shall begin with is that the army of the Potomac during the summer of 1863 was as good as an army that ever marched to battle (not better).  The fore part of June Pleasantons Cavalry met and defeated Stewarts at Kellie's Ford. On the 6th of June Gen. Sedgewick crossed the river again capturing about 60 prisoners and remained several days on that side of the river.  But Lee having began his Great flank movement. He was recalled and on the 13th after dark we moved out four or five miles then back again and off again, so as Gen. Lee in his report expressed it \"At sunrise on the morning of the 14th the last of the enemy disappeared behind the Heights of Stafford.\"  The weather was exceedingly sultry and very many of the","d4332b9a80a45d1646e15c68bc8e2ce4.jpg"],[87679,"80\nthe soldiers fainted.  About noon we arrived at Stafford C.H. Which has nothing about it to commend it to notice even in this insignificant narrative.  After a short rest we moved on and crossing Aquia Creek wearied and worn we at last encamped on the banks or rather hills that over look the valey of this sweet stream. It so fell out that I was on guard that night. And for the first time for many months tasted milk, it being my duty to guard the cattle of an old \"Secesh\" who told me that Weans will fight while there is a man of us left. Nevertheless I could well afford to guard his property for the sake of the good supper after our toilsome march.\nBut I have neglected to give the number of our boys without which it will be impossible for me to fully illustrate the heroic spirit of that army at that time.  We numbered 7,000[?] Healthy, strong, and resolute men as ever marched to battle. Complaining had almost entirely ceased. The idlest stories bout the demoralization of the army were rife in the North. But the march of the 15th of May was enough alone to give the lie to all such stories the weather was hot beyond endurance to all almost anything but a salamander. We moved out early in the morning and continued a rapid march with but few minutes rest during the entire day of our 7,000. 800 fell in the ranks from exhaustion and the excessive heat of the sun, 100 of these never recovered. and yet there was scarcely any straggling. Men marched till they fell","8fc86b30762c47d82ad94252996bf248.jpg"],[87680,"in their ranks rather than be among the stragglers. If this be demoralization God save me from ever meeting a demoralized army.  But this day like all other days had its end as the \"sable wing of night ore spread the earth\" we drew into a pleasant camp on the banks of the Ocquanguan at Wolfe Run shoals.  Where we bathed, made and drank strong coffee, and sand down to a night of sweet repose.  Morning came and again we moved forward. Arriving near Sangters Station. We were forming prepatory to stopping when I noticed that the brigade in front of us was moving out and called the attention of the man on my right to the fact when one the soldiers my file leader at the time turned around and in his usual manner threw some insult in my face. My blood being hot at the time I had not full control of myself but struck him in the face.  I had perhaps raised my hand twenty times before this to strike him but had caught myself before the mischief was done; the blow fell heavy enough to send him staggering against Lieut. Ball who was more enraged it seemed than the soldier was himself. \"What are you doing?\" he exclaimed. Strike a man with his back turned to you, you are a coward.\"  I replied in equally strong language, \"Sir, I am not, and his back was not turned to me.\"  \"Shut your mouth I'll finish you for this\" was his reply. \"As you say.\" was my answer. I then sat down and gnashed my teeth for a few minutes, but in that few minutes my mind was made up. I'll show him if ever we entered another battle that I was no more a coward than he!  And if we never entered battle again he should repudiate his assertion or prove it true by a successful","f9e60b921c47f43aace6b5529ff172e8.jpg"],[87681,"82\nexhibition of his own valor. We camped for the night at Sangsters then moved on to Centerville where we encamped about twenty four hours then moved on the Troughfare Gap which we guarded for a few days.  The morning that we left the Gap we saw a force of rebel cavalry cross the mountain by a by path just to the left of us. We had not moved more than two miles before they appeared on a little eminence to our right.# Some of the boys thought they were our men. The discussion did not last long however as we all or nearly all soon agreed that they were rebels.  Then the question arose whether they had any artilery or not. Some of the boys urged that they would have fired before now if they had artilery. I had just replied that there was time enough yet when while the words were just on my tongue, we saw the white smoke raise from their guns. This was the first time in my life when I was glad to see the smoke raise from the enemy's guns. but on this occasion I laughed outright looking all the time in the face of Lieut. Ball. Our batteries were soon wheeled into position and replied.  When the rebels retired. We soon changed our directions moving toward the Potomac. Through a lovely valley we marched until nearly ten oclock that night and camped near Gum Springs.  Next morning Hezekiah joined us from the hospital. And again for a short spell I had a companion with whom I could converse freely knowing that I would be appreciated.\n\nThis right and left must not be mistaken. When I spoke of the cavalry passing our left we were faced torward the mountains but this was the same force being on our right after we faced about marching toward the river.","15c84a08cdfee40b176c77b8f0cbe794.jpg"],[87682,"83\nagain we moved on. A damp rainy day. It was nearly night when we reached the Potomac at Edwards ferry. Thus we had returned to our old stand just about 16 months after we broke camp there and my first campaign was opened. How much had transpired in those months.  I had seen many bloody battles, from a green recruit I had become a seasoned vetran[veteran]; I had become convinces of the existence of a God though to say the truth I verily believe I was as much a sinner as ever. Nevertheless I read my Testament and prayed.  But I continually observed that I was \"prone to wander,\" since that time I have never ceased to pray, although for a long time it was with weak faith.  But more of this hereafter.  Just after crossing the river we camped until morning. While we were encamped there William Riddle a cowardly sort of boy belonging to our company, in a discussion with me on the merits of Gen. McClellan called me a liar because I said that he was a \"copperhead\" and did not deserve a command.  Being small I paid little attention to the insult, especially as I know that the person who gave it was a known coward.  I merely tell this to show that I was contending both ways, with the people at home because they were to violent in their demonstrations, and with the soldiers because they were too extravagent in their praises, and I have another reason to speak of it because I shall have occasion to speak of Riddle hereafter. We marched on that day beyond Barnstown and camped no great distance from Sugarloaf Mountain.  It was on this days march that we received the news of the capture of the Rebel Ram[?] Atlanta with which","60060409df14537b21123f86069f5f34.jpg"],[87683,"84\nThey had boasted that they would distroy the whole Yankee Navy. But five shots from the Weehauken compelled her to surrender. I speak of this not as having anything to do with my Journal but because of the triumph of our Navy and of the Consternation it created in England.  The English papers came out immediately with the acknowledgement that the Atlanta was nearly as strongly plated as either of their great vessels the Warrior, Black Prince, and Achilles. And what would be the result should they come into collision with the United States upon a little monitor[?] battery of two Guns had compelled her surrender at five shots each of which passed in entered at one side and passed out at the other. I have not given the exact words of their papers but just the substance.  Again on the morrow we set forward and on this day it was noised through the army that Gen. Meade had suspended Hooker. But we had become so accustomed to change and even defeat that nothing could disturb our equanimity we could neither be depressed by disaster nor elated by success.  We camped near Fredric City. I think that on the following morning Gen. Meades order assuming command was read to us. He used very modest language not promising anything but yet he spoke cheerfully and hopefully.  We had not been long on the march before it became evident that our commander meant \"to make a spoon or spoil a handle.\"  The news of our advance never went before us villagers where they were expecting the rebels every minute were surprised to see the head of our column appear over the hills and descending like a rapid river we would pass through the streets at a rate that was astonishing to any citizen. But it was an","3766244d38af878b494b6b783613ae7d.jpg"],[87684,"85\narmy of iron veterans sifted and reduced to its fighting weight. As will be clearly demonstrated ere I close the campaign We marched 33 miles by the road which we were compelled to take that day. And secured the heights beyond Union Town and within striking distance of Gettysburg. Next morning an order was read from Gen. Hancock complementing us for our yesterday's march assuring us that it was necessary and we had done a good work which indeed was true.#  After remaining in this place all day the 30th of June we marched early on the morning of the 1st of July toward Gettysburg.\n\nI was ordered on picket immediately after getting into camp and I went cheerfully without swearing a single oath though I cannot say that all my comrades were as successful in restraining their temper as I was on this occasion although I had as bad a temper as any of them. But Berdan was on the same detail and he was always a cheerful soldier. And he and I had always mutually scored to complain at any duty which could be laid upon us.  Berdan was a true Christian and I always observed that Christians were invariably the best soldiers. If there were others as brave there were not as cheerful and patient as them.  The people were all Union in this neighborhood. I saw a women standing with some nice bread in village of Union Town. I approached and asked her to sell me some. She said, \"no I won't - we are union here and thereupon handed me a large piece which I found well buttered. Frankly their little village is rightly named. What a contrast with the vacinity[?] of Gettysburg!  Here we were mustered for pay on the 30th of June and having accomplished the object of our toilsome march we rested for one day and two nights.","bd37d649409a2b42e36941578da3fe8a.jpg"],[87685,"86\nabout noon we came to a halt in a pleasant wood near Tanny Town [?]. everything looked very much like going into camp. but we had not been there long before we were ordered into ranks and moved rapidly forward. The great battle had opened soon Gen. Hancock left us and rode forward to take command of the forces on the field until Meade could arrive in person.  Gen. Reyonalds had already fallen. and the forces were commanded by Howard until such time as Hancock should arrive at the front.  As we pushed forward various stories met us as to how the battle was going.  But any experienced soldier could perceive that if our men were being worsted it had not appeared in the form of a route but that they had retired in good order. else we would have heard wild stories of \"regiments cut to pieces and I'm all the one thats left.\"  No such news reached us. Some said it calmly \"We are getting worsted\" others that it was hard telling which had the worst but all agreed that the battle was opened and that it was bloody.  Finally news reached us that the enemy's advance had been checked and that our forces had captured a rebel brigade.  This I believe was all true.  Being near the field we laid down to wait for morning, which when it came was foggy and drizzling rain. We moved up to our positions. What was my surprize to see batteries unlimbered not 40 rods apart and fronting in exactly opposite directions. We were quickly posted extra ammunition was distributed and the order of the day was read. There was not much talk but the countenances both of men and officers seemed expressive of a determination","38e67f48191d42339c1aeb811a890eaa.jpg"],[87686,"87\nto give them the \"best we had in the shop,\"  Of course there was a little speculation on the probably plan of the enemy and some remarks made on the strange position which we occupied but we soon all agreed that if our forces occupied certain hills on the right and on which our artilery was fearing[?] that we had a strong position but if the rebels held those hills our position was anything but a safe one. doubts were soon dispelled by the 12 corps moving up into the hills and our artilery changing its position. Our corps which had hitherto been on the right side of the horseshoe now about faced and marched only a few rods over to the left. The couxity[?] of the horse show was Cymetry[?] Hill which was near to the centre of our lines.  And the position which we now occupied was immediately to the left of Cymetry Hill and called the left Centre.  A slight elevation of ground extends like a ridge from Cymetry Hill to a small woody mount[?] on the left of our lines And a similar elevation extends in like manner to a like mount on the right thus our position was like a semicircular wall defended by three towers while just behind us stood one round mount by its self with no ridge extending to it and only affording position for a few guns and would give us but little aid if our first lines were once broken and then it was miles before another position for defence could be formed.  Therefore we must hold the ground or prepare for annihilation.  Soon after our Corps had taken it post the 3d Corp was moving into position and their commander Gen. mistook Gen. Meades order to post his corps on the bridge to Sickly[?] the left of ours understanding that he was to advance to another ridge half mile in advance of us.  This blunder well nigh ruined the army.  The corps moved forward in the lines of battle.","59e2e43d0d547366220572979fec0ef0.jpg"],[87687,"88\nThe rain had ceased and the sun shone lightly on their arms as they moved forward cooly as men on parade. Oh it was a beautiful sight though we all knew it meant nothing but fierce conflict.  But the old 3d Corp was to well known to admit of a doubt but that they would do all that human valor could do. Not 600 yards to their left was a woods. And as we saw them advance the question naturally presented itself to us whether our forces held those woods or not.  Some said they did giving us a reason for thinking so that no General would be fool enough to send that Corp out that way without knowing what was in those woods.  At the same instant the white smoke flew up from twelve pieces of rebel artilery which was posted in the woods.  Their fire exactly enfiladed the noble corps that had thus been carelessly allowed to be ensnared. The report of the guns had not reached us before more than a thousand men exclaimed \"Out generaled again!!!\"  A single battery which had advanced with the corps wheeled into position how they ever got into position was a miracle but one of the men who belonged to the battery afterwards told me that the rebel shot had all passed over their heads and fell among the infantry.  This is highly probable for some of their shots came clear over to where we were nearly a mile from the battery. At any rate they got into position and I believe they did not lose a great many men until after they had got into position.  Our batteries on Cymetry Hill turned their fire on the rebel guns and immediately the rebel guns in their front opened# on them and the artilery on both sides was soon battling with tremendous fury.  The rebel infantry now fell upon the 3d\n\nThe firing on this occasion was very heavy and the men in the next company to the right of us were struck by one shell, one was killed instantly ones foot was entirely torn off and the others were severely wounded. these men were right next to Hezekiah and this was his first time under fire.  I looked at him to see how he would take it. But his countenance never changed He never gave signs of being conscious of danger, nor I have I ever known him to show that he even was aware of danger.","8ff925a3f19c1fb01e33de74abeccec7.jpg"],[87688,"89\ncorp. and although it battled bravely for hours at a great disadvantage yet it was compelled gradually to fire many  on came the pursuing rebels in swarms like bees.  but slowly did the old corp retire giving only an inch of ground at a time and firing the contents of many a well-loaded musket into the faces of its enemies.  Oh! it was sublime to see the heroism there displayed.  The grandest charges which the history of the world can produce sink to nothing before such courage as is at time displayed in the retreat of a body of men before overwhelming forces.  The noble battery after doing what could be done by human valor was captured by the rebels.  But the old 3d Corps was not long to be alone, for our division was ordered to its assistance.  And soon our Company was deployed and moved forward into a ravine which was full of bushes and large rocks for us to protect ourselves withall.  This ravine was so situated that ere the rebels as they were then advancing could reach our ridge their left flank would be exposed to our enfilading fire. So we laid down in the trench and watched the 3d Corps falling back. Soon the last of the 3d Corp had passed us (on our left) and the rebels followed yelling after a few from the right of the 3d Corps had jumped into the bushes with us and together with us began to send death shot into the rebel flank. Oh! I did wish we were a brigade instead of a mere company.  The rebels pressed forward on our left and gained the Hill on that flank but they were not permitted to enjoy it long for the Pennsylvania Reserves[?] coming up charged then and drove them from it again.  Some rebels coming up directly in front of our company we were compelled to retreat from the ravine and as we gradually fell back fighting we missed our regt.

All this time I was near Lieut. Ball and doing everything in my power to make him ashamed of himself.  I looked into his face and laughed a dozzen times.  we fell back behind the lines which charged as quick as the skirmishers were out of the way.  Hezekiah lost the company but found the regt. and went into that furious charge of the 8 companies which charged into the heart of a rebel division. The Charge of the six hundred at Balack Lava [?] was not as sanguine to the British Cavalry as that charge was to the 1st Minnesota. five sixths of the men who went in on that charge were killed or wounded yet they brought off their colors.  Although but one of the color guard was left.  The regt fell back but support coming up the 6th Corp. having arrived after a forced march of 32 miles. the rebels were driven back and the 19th Maine Regt. which were in their first real battle advanced and recaptured our battery which had fallen into the enemy's hands a few hours before. They brought of the part of the battery by hand but one or two of the pieces were so damaged as to be worthless and were consequently left.  The shade of night closed over the scene of horror.

He had indeed been seriously injured in one of his eyes by a shell which knocked his gun from his hand and broke a picture of his wife and little ones.  He and Ole Johnson were standing by a tree after the regt. had fallen back from that fearful charge, loading and taking rest by the side of the tree to fire when the shell burst near them doing the dammage which I have mentioned.  The enemy seemed content to let us sleep quietly that night and we reposed on our arms without disturbance.  It is said that Gen. Lee was so confident that we would retreat during the night that he gave ordered to his generals to be ready to pursue the enemy at daylight.  But our general had not brought us there merely to retreat in truth we were an army in earnest from the commanding general down to the lowest private in the rear rank (i.e., your humble servant).  Morning came. And with it a fierce battle on the right in which the enemy were worsted, losing ground instead of going as they intended, for after repulsing their charge Gen. Geary pursued them and advanced his lines nearly half a mile. Then there was a lull. everything seemed remarkably quiet, but experienced soldiers always tread these quiet hours in a battle knowing that some mighty mischief is brewing. The phrase \"Ominous Silence\" how applicable to such an occasion.  One of the dead lulls in a battle is almost a sure indication that the grand effort is about to be made.  And thus all was silent for the space of three hours.  From the time","11a3b99a8d5834820dd54dffe4ec0e9c.jpg"],[87691,"92\nof Gen. Geary's success on the right which terminated bout 10 oclock until about 1 P.M. Not a piece of artilery was fired and even the skirmishers scarcely fired a shot.  The silence seemed to grow more and more intense.  Bang! Bang!! two signal guns sent shot into our lines.  How can mortal pen write or mortal tongue tell or mortal mind conceive what followed!  Along or [our] whole front especially in front of our corps on the left centre, where a hundred and forty five War Dogs opened their brazen throats. And fired in volleys not as artilery but as the continual rattle of musketry; with all the weight of sound and metal from a ten pound parrot to a 32 pound Howitzer. Had all the demons of the infernal regions been let loose they could scarcely have excelled what their intelligent pupil man had here produced for peopling those lower regions with souls unfitted to enter the gates of happiness.  The hot shot hissing and crossing each other in their firey course over our heads.  As a good simile of it was given by another I will quote his words as more appropriate# than aught I can say myself.  \"It seemed that all the devils in hell were let loose and were holding high carnival over us.\"  As we lay flat on our faces they would strike# the ground in front of us and bounding\n\nThe force with which a shell strikes the ground cannot be appreciated by any one who has not seen and heard.  But stretch your imagination to its utmost limit and then multiply it indefinitely and you will fall short of the truth.  I have nothing to liken it to and consequently must leave it totally to your imagination. I can only say that all such description as \"ploughing up the ground\" are so very weak as to be foolish. If you have ever seen a tree struck by lightning you can form some idea but there is nothing eles which citizens ever see that will do for a simile.","990953bc3340f063d775961218140171.jpg"],[87692,"93\nour heads would go on their way growing in an anger too terrible for conception. Again they would explode in our front and the ugly missiles would come down with a sound unpleasant to the ears and fall with a proximity that in hours of less excitement would cause the bravest to think of the uncertainty of human life.  Again they would sing n wrath so very close that we would involuntarily cling more closely to Mother Earth. Here they would strike in a cassion And high in air would go a cloud of smoke and wide and far the scattered fragments of shells and timber would fly the air would give so that it would seem that we were raised from the ground our batteries were not idle but rapidly and accurately did they resound and repeatedly did we see the clouds of smoke rise from the rebel lines showing that their timbers and cassions were not more safe than ours though they were using nearly two guns to our one but our artilery always was better than that of the rebels. We were laying between the two fires ours firing over our heads we seemed to be in the only safe place on that field for horses and men fell every where else but right were our Regt. lay. had we layed two rods behind where we did we must have lost nearly half our men in that artilery fire and and a like results would have followed had we been two rods in advance the reason of this is there was a slight elevation of ground just in front of us and as it was not more than 800 yards to the rebel guns the shell were passing on nearly a level and would strike the hill or pass over. And so it happened that they did not get to exploding at the right point and I believe that not a man","e082577c8a16b60304ae8551d2d77078.jpg"],[87693,"94\nin our regt. was hurt by that fierce cannonade from which we were now after two hours and a half to be relieved.  They are coming!!  Oh! what a joyful sound!  You may think strange that I say so but it was the greatest relief that I had ever then experienced, and in fact I was never so relieved but once since and that will be seen in the course of my journal.  We rose to our feet moved forward a few paces to where there was a sort of stone fence which was only a little above the ground but on top of which we had piled rails which had however been displaced in many places by the rebel artilery. They were coming directly towards us, and having some extra cartridges which I had picked up on the field I laid them on the ground before me and kneeled behind the fense rested my gun across a rail and waited their approach. Never in my life have I felt so strong as I did at that minute as I looked along our lines and saw that the whole fense was bristling with guns.  And that all the soldiers were calmly waiting the onset.  I stole a glance at the countenances of those who were nearest to me. I saw there nothing but a determination to do or to die.  Here was the old 2d Corps not over 7,000[?] strong. Waiting patiently the approach of 30,000 of the best troops in the rebel army and as good soldiers as the world ever saw (but we had the advantage of position).  When they had reached a point of about 300 yards distant one of our boys fired at them.  Lieutenant Ball spoke out commanding us not to fire yet. \"They are not close enough\"  I took a look at them and turned to the Lieutenant and","1cf165fd966d79b861499ea648ffbbc1.jpg"],[87694,"95\nsaid \"We can throw our balls through their ranks every shot from here.\"  \"Fire away then.\" It seemed that the whole Corps had come to the same conclusion for the entire line fired at once.  They were coming at double quick time if not on the run.  They changed their course and moved to our right directing their attach against Cymetry Hill where was posted Battery A 4th USA and Battery P. 1st U.S. / Rickets. Formerly Magruders celebrated in time of the Mexican war.  We waited no command but moved to our right to meet them sending bullets into their ranks as fast as we could load and fire. They rushed up with such impetuosity that they planted their colors on two pieces of Battery A. There they had seemed to Mass on that point and we had hemmed[?] them with a thin semicircle. They could never lift their colors from those guns so deadly was our fire every man fighting on his own hook.  Gibbeon and Hancock both fell severely wounded. But we had no more need for a commander for we would now have achieved the victory had we been left without an officer for we could see every movement of the enemy and knew how to defend our hills.  In short we did the rest of the commanding ourselves.  About this time a bullet passed through the leg of my pants.  I soon after passed by Hezekiah he was laying down resting and loading his gun. I saw a spot of blood on his pants leg and asked him if he was wounded he said not.  I told him I guessed he was and rushed on towards the enemy's flags of which I was very anxious to secure a specimen to shake in","ba75e381ca32217ee0882a0bedee213b.jpg"],[87695,"96\nLieut. Ball's face. But I was not to be so highly favored. When I had approached within a few steps of their flags I saw an old Friend. H. J. W. Brown firing as if his whole soul were bound up in the destruction of the rebel army.  Close by was Jackson of Co. G[Y?]. covered with dust and dirt and blacked with powder fighting like he might have been a descendant of the Hero of the same name.  My own gun had become so heated that I could hardly load it in fact I had a bullet part way down but could not push it on. Jackson yelled, \"Why don't you shoot?\"  \"My guns so hot I can't this bullet down,\"  \"Well lay down then don't stand there and let them shoot at you.\"  This was sound advice but I was too much interested in securing a flag to heed it.  I pushed on and reached the wall just a little to the left of where the flag was. I verily believe there was twenty rebels jumped up without their guns hollering don't shoot. Do not take this to that I mean to say that twenty men surrendered to me (I am not that kind of a hero and God forbid that I ever should be). but I was on this occasion the first one to the wall and the rebels knew when I appeared that our men would not fire on them should they spring up and surrender.  We never attempted to guard them to the rear but just told them to run back leaving the duty of collecting for the provost guards but to the right of the flags the rebels were still fighting and I saw one loading","10b74069e3c7dcfc044cb8ca2d17e492.jpg"],[87696,"97\nhis gun with his eye fixed on the particular flag which was nearest to me. And I stopped put my ramrod against the stone wall and pushed the bullet home capped my gun and raised my eyes the rebels to the right of the flag were all passing through our lines minus their guns. And Marshall Sherman of Co. C. had my prize.  The rest of the flags were gobbled up by other soldiers so that out of the 28 stands which were taken by our corps I did not get a rag. Two more men had been wounded with our own colors. The staff of our flag had been shot in two.  We had lost half# to men in our corps and had taken more prisoners than there was of us and had killed and wounded more than we had taken.  We had left the artilery on our left without protection in order to repel this fierce assault and now a division of rebels made a dash at it but we run down and before I could get there running my best those which were nearer had repulsed and captured\n\nNow ye who sneer at the Army of the Potomac go and hunt your statistics and show us where in history any considerable force ever defeated its enemy held its ground without assistance and yet lost half its men. An now go and examine the official figures and see if I have exaggerated and moreover see if you can find another battle since the invention of gun powder that will for obstinance and blood equal Gettysburg.  With not much more than half as many men engaged we spilled about the same amount of blood that was wasted at Waterloo and the charge of the Old Guard at Waterloo will not excel that of the rebels on the 3d.  And that of the six hundred at Ballackloca will not surpass that of the Minnesota 1st on the 2d.  We ask nothing but justice and a candid hearing of our case.","67eed9492c630de6f704ab18b52f5bbb.jpg"],[87697,"98\nnearly the whole division. The few remains of our Regt were now Collected and Lieut. Ball was the senior office and accordingly took the command. But Capt. Coats and Capt. Chase both cowards came up afterwards and Coats took the command.  Capt. Duffee who had been on Gen. Gibbons staff also returned to the regt. after the battle.  Our little band collected on Cymetry Hill 81[87?] strong about half belonging to Cos. F and L which were both on the skirmish line on the 2d and L continued on the line on the 3d which accounts for the comparatively small loss in those two companies.  When our Regt. went into the battle we were 301 exclusive of Co. C. On Provost Guard and now we were 81. Co. C also suffered severely on the 3d so that our total loss in the battle was 232 killed and wounded which was about three fourths of our fighting men as the \n301 included musicians and hospital attendants.  Of the 8 companies which participated in the fearful charge on the 2d full five sixths were either killed or wounded.  There was but one man missing and he was found killed afterwards.\nRiddle who was so courageous to give me the lie only a few days before had played the coward and slipped back to the hospital at the beginning.  After the battle (Capt. Ball received his commission a day or two after the battle) ordered him under arrest.\nHaving collected our little remnant we took our old position just at sundown it soon gen[?] dark; and then","deae29d247d50ebd926c73e8d03a7193.jpg"],[87698,"99\n\"The pale moon rose up slowly and calmly she looked down\nOn to red sands of the battlefield with bloody corpses strewn.\"\nI rose up and repeated the verse. Again must I listen to the groans of thousands of suffering men without the possibility of giving aid.  It rained before morning in fact for 18 days about that time it rained every day and also there was warm bright sunshine every day. These rains had well nigh proceed to ruin of the rebel army by raising the Potomac especially as Gen Finch in command at Harpers Ferry made a dash in their rear and destroyed their bridge at Williamsport.  Morning came and all seemed quiet. our skirmishers advanced and felt of the enemy. they were found however waiting an attack from us. This Gen. Meade prudently declined making.  For notwithstanding the great number which we had slain they were yet stronger than we.  The 3rd Corps skirmishers advanced in a beautiful line, running with ease over the ground which had been the scene of their late repulse. when they had reached the point where the enemy opened on them before we saw the smoke rise from their own good rifles which fire was returned weakly by the enemy. the skirmishers advanced fire and running double quick until they expelled the enemy's pickets from the woods in front. at last a piece of rebel artilery opened. this being all that was required the skirmishers retired a few rods and then lay down. We remained quiet all day, this little skirmish, if such a thing it may be called, being all the Celebration we had on the 4th of July. Night came a rainy","465ca6743185d5cb1cae268856cd9e6d.jpg"],[87699,"100\ndrizzly night we sat on our knapsacks nearly all night.  On the morning of the 5th I was ordered on picket. But as soon as we were in position it was discovered that the enemy had retreated and the 6th Corps marched past us in pursuit.  We returned to our command and soon heard the guns of our flying artilery thundering on the rear of the enemy.  OUr Corps remained on the field burying the dead until evening when we began a flank movement by way of Frederick City.  It is not necessary for me to give the full particulars of this march.  Suffice it to say we marched back by the City over to Katacthin[?] Mountains. Through Cramptons Gap in the Blue Ridge over one corner of the Antietam battle field thence up the river to near Williamsport where the enemy moving on a line not over one 3d as long as the one on which we were compelled to move had arrived and was strongly posted.  But before this Gen. French had sullied out from Harpers Ferry and destroyed their pontoon[?] bridge. It was I think the 13th that we arrived with inferior numbers before the enemy in good field works and a naturally strong position.  And here Gen. Meade is blamed for not attacking the enemy.  I looked at the works and the position at leisure after the enemy had abandoned them, and it is very firm conviction that an attack made with vigor on those works would have annihilated our army.  And anything else but a vigorous attack would have been worse than fools. However I fully believe that the enemy might have been","1a6cff734f3844488926062218689530.jpg"],[87700,"101\ndestroyed there or before he reached there had those slates near at had done what might reasonably have been expected of them and had Gen. Halleck sent all the vetrans that were laying useless around Washington to the front an army as large as the whole army of the Potomac could have been posted at Williamsport directly in Lee's rear while we were engaging him at Gettysburg.  Then all blame rests on old Moth Halleck and our imbecil citizens and not on this army and its commander.  Gen. Meade did all that a great commander could, which was to advance on the 14th and close our lines up to the enemy's works and prepared for an attack on the 15th as by that time it was hoped Conch would arrive with a few thousand vetrans and a horde of militia and also that some of Hallacks slow motioned recruits from the Peninsula would reach us but alas; in the morning, when Gen. Kilpatrick moved out to open the battle the bird had flown but even then he did not escape unscathed for Killpatrick fell on his rear before it had all crossed the river killed the rebel Gen. Pettigrew and captured a brigade of Infantry two pieces of artilery and two stand of colors.  I saw the prisoners and colors and guns, so that I have every reason to believe that they were taken. But Gen. Lee says in his report that only a few stragglers were picked up in barns. However Gen. Lee did his best to cover up the results of this campaign.  Leaving","dd0cb1585cbf111c4b06ff578a189287.jpg"],[87701,"102\nthe vicinity[?] of Williamsport we marched to Harpers Ferry. On this day Riddle deserted I speak of this here because I shall have occasion to speak of him again and because he is a specimen of a great many of the demoncratically inclined soldiers.  I do not say that all the demmocratic soldiers were of this kind nor even the half of them but I do but I do say that I never knew but one instance of a cowardly soldier who was not more or less a blow hard against abolitionists.  These are truths for the people of the north to remember.  We camped near Harper's Ferry for one day and then crossed the Potomac and Shenandoah and moved up London Valley. I was afflicted with a poisoned leg during all the rest of this mark and was compelled to ride in the ambulances.  While we were on this march the orderly sergeant came to me one morning with a notice that the Capt. (Ball) had appointed me a corporal with orders that I should report for a guard to the colors.  This looked a little suspicious to me. nine men had fallen with the colors at Gettysburg and now he was sending a man there whom he had called a coward not long before.  I concluded that it meant one of two things it either meant that he wanted to put me into a dangerous place or he was ashamed of what he had done and was taking a sly way to get out of confessing which would have hurt a man of his pride greatly. Certain it is that he nearly always avoided speaking to me after the time he insulted me. But more of this hereafter.  It was on this march that the Gallant old 3d Corp defeated a detachment of rebels at Wapping Heights capturing quite a number of prisoners. We moved on below Warrenton camped a few days then proceeded to a position not far from Bealton Station.","933215b0bed33ea13f3afc66fe491d3e.jpg"],[87702,"103\nour cavalry crossed the Rappahannock at Kelley's Ford had a battle with the rebel cavalry and defeated them after which they retired across the river leaving off pursuing the rebel army which we had followed now more than 100 miles.  While I was here I wrote a letter to one Miss Mary E. Piper whose stencil plate I found in a rebel pocket book on the field of Gettysburg. Which in due time she answered but that will appear in my Diary which fortunately I am now able to renew having the records for the remainder of my service.  I hope dates and minor event may be stated more clearly than they have been heretofore and also the exact state of my mind which can never be recorded from memory.  And if any one can read this record and not be utterly sick of human nature he has a better stomach than I. I shall in most cases record the words of the Diary after which I shall make commentaries on each day before I take up the next.  my reason for preserving the exact words is because I can thereby give a clear idea of thoughts as they then passed through my mind.  There are many things, however, recorded in my private diary which are too black for a place in this history yet they are all true and I recorded them with a good design of keeping in memory what a great evil war is and what depths of degradation human natures does descend to in our large Cities.  My own faults and follies that any one may read and take warning as I have remarked before I was a great a sinner as ever not withstanding my partial conviction of the truth of Christianity. But my Journal must explain itself as I proceed and hence I will now open it and copy what was written in those days of war and trial.","6c192eb04a6d5150dbde5fbcf67e0ffc.jpg"],[87703,"104\nDiary of D.

They are here on drill. Some are here on probation. The post is commanded by Col. Loomis and old soldier, too old for active service.\nTuesday Aug. 25th\nI took a walk around the island this morning. I was at the regular guard mount. The musicians were dressed in style sufficient for major generals and the drum major had more gold and tinsel about him than I ever saw before.

A dress parade in the evening. I have spent a happy day. The ladies are increasing in their attentions to us. I believe it is a spirit of romance mingled with their patriotism that makes them admire a soldier so much.  It seemed to me sometimes, this day like I could see pride shining in their blessed little eyes as they were escorted around camp by some ___ hero of half score of bloody battles.  However I do not wish to be misanthropic. I merely remark this as a fact in human nature. And I will here say that I believe the fair ones are right in leaning naturally to those who have proved both able and willing to protect them. I say not this by way of claim for myself for there is no spirit of gallantry in me. And most likely no fair one will ever read this.  But it behooves me to discuss freely the things which are passing before my eyes. I hope I may never be of that class who \"Having eyes, see not; and having ears hear not.\"\nWednesday Sept. 2d\nWe had plenty of melons, and peaches given us by the good citizens, a brigade drill, a dress parade.

We were conducted to a bountiful repast spread under a spacious canopy erected for the purpose.  Where the ladies kind and beautiful as fairies were there to welcome us and make us at home. I must confess that I felt proud to be received among the number who were worthy of such honor, when we arose to depart they bestowed on each of us a boquet of lovely flowers. Oh! it thrills ones heart with joy to receive such attentions.  All the soldiers are happy.\nSaturday Sept. 5th 1863\nI have been reading as usual. Mr. Buckelen bought the company a large supply of apples and peaches. I saw one Andrew Davis who belongs to the sloop of war Brooklyn. He is acquainted with Miss Piper of stencil plate notariety.

The poor dear tender hearted creatures can it be possible that they are thus interested already in a band of warlike adventurers?#\nEvening:\nWe marched down to the ferry and crossed to N.Y about noon. We marched in splendid style up Broadway among other noted buildings I was enabled to get an outside view of Barnums Museum.  I gave young Mr. Buckelew a piece of our old flag.  He accompanied us to the wharf where we and the 126th Ohio got aboard of the Steam Ship Empire City.  and are now fairly out to sea.  I notice that this is a very swift vessel. The short time which we have spent in Brooklyn will long be remembered by the soldiers of the old 1st.  Such kindness we could hardly expect even from the people of our own state.  Never were our boys so loathe to leave a place as they were to depart from the City of Brooklyn.  And nearly all the boys have left fair correspondents in this truly noble city.\n\nIN this connection it is only necessary for me to say that our regt. was composed largely of adventurers. Huters, trappers, miners, sailors, lumberman from Maine to Callifornia. From Kansas and almost every state in the Unions.  from almost every European country including Russia. Therefore I think I am justified in calling them a \"band of warlike adventurers.\" Nothwithstanding, we had men from nearly every country in Europe, yet there was not a great proportion of Foreigners in the regt.  I think we were about 5 Americans to one Foreigner when we went into the field but many of both had now perished.","96fa0788399821e81422333c831b953b.jpg"],[87714,"115\nOn the ocean Monday Sept. 7th\nWe have spent the day as is usual on ship board in pleasant weather looking at the broad expanse of water watching every passing sail observing the movements of schools of fish.

I have observed one thing on the march to day which I will note down as illustrating human nature. We marched a very long time this forenoon without rest, and some of the boys were extremely bitter in their demonstrations of Col. Carrol.  A little after noon, however, we arrived at a very beautiful valley well shaded with fine trees and a transparent brook flows rippling over a pebbly bottom. Here by the side of this lovely stream the Colonel gave orders to stop three hours. ON hearing this, the same soldiers, who had been loudest in their curses, proposed three cheers for Col. Carroll.  But the others who had said nothing on the one extreme now held their equilibrium on the other and the cheers were not given.  Such is the stable character of the Glorious Union Army. I have no confidence whatever in such men.\nI have copied the above just as I find it written in the Diary.  I wish to say however that the last remark was written in the passion of the moment, and should not be taken as covering ground relating to soldierly courage for many of those same men were as brave as I ever saw on the battle field.  But this shows how slight a cause will move the passions of men. And when I say I have no confidence in such men I mean that I would not give much for their friendship for it can be either won or lost in a minute.  This is true.

I notice that many things are artfully concealed. I had supposed Gen.

For example, a Girl writing to her beloved wishes he would get a furlough and come home so that they could be married that she might draw $5 per month from the state being a soldier's wife (handy no doubt). Take another example in an opposite direction.\nA girl, living in Petersburg Virginia, writing to her rebel love who it seems has been urging the necessity of his getting a furlough and of their being married, in reply stated that \"Silk is $27 a yard, and you wouldn't want to marry me looking like anything and a wedding dress can not be afforded at such prices besides Pa will never consent till the war is over.\nAgain, a lady in Maine somewhere was writing to a soldier, to all appearances she was trying to set his mind against a rival.  She tells him that there are as good fish in the sea as have ever been caught out, and adds: \"They are for you too.\"  A great many other things she said against her rival (most of which I presume were base lies)\nFriday Oct. 9th\nThe execution which was to have been today has been postponed.\n\nMay 1916, since that time I have learned that honorable men are just like dishonorable men - smart men are fools, and fools are men of genius.","22dd102235c3302fd98e1482cc7dc4b5.jpg"],[87723,"124\nby order of the President.

Starting forward sometime after noon, we had proceeded about 3 miles when suddenly a couple of rebel guns thundered out almost directly in front of us. No citizen can imagine the scene that followed.  There was no jumping and sputtering around to see what was to be done, but rather we fell to work to do something and that quickly.  The enemies guns were on a hill only about half a mile from the rail road along which we were marching and fully that much in advance of the head of our column. Our Regt. being in the advance, Gen. Webb was riding at the head of it by the side of Major Downie[?] who commanded our regt. at that time.","3767652cce3ec31530082ef2a1ee59d9.jpg"],[87725,"126\nThe instant that the report of the guns was heard He [the general] turned around \"Major, deploy your Regt. double quick.\"  His words were not finished when the Major commanded \"By company into line\" \"Forward into line double quick.\" and thus half minute had not passed and we were in line facing the spot where danger was supposed to exist and immediately began to take intervals prepatory to skirmishing with the enemy.

They hurried up onto a hill just to the right of the road and just about opposite the rebel battery. Our regt. had in the mean time changed its direction and formed again parralel with the road, as the enemy had not yet got possession of the road which was feared at first. But now it emerged into the open field at the farther edge of which was posted the rebel battery. And Hazzards was on the other side, thus the regt. was between the two.

But I learned from a rebel Diary that some of the boys found a few weeks afterwards that they thought the 5th Corps which was in advance of us was the rear of our army.  Certain it is that they continued to fire at the 5th until our Battery opened and at that late hour turned their guns against it. in the mean time the old 1st 145 strong here making Herculean efforts to check the advance of two lines of battle which were charging with great fury toward our battery. There was quite a high grade of the rail road thrown up just a few rods in front of our battery behind which grade Gen. Webb was forming the division as fast as possible. Our Regt. drove the rebel skirmishers back onto their lines of battle, then checked overwhelming columns two or three times so that when it was finally compelled to give way, it found the whole division well posted behind the Rail Road.  We of the colors had taken a stand near Hazzards Battery, whence we had a view of the whole battle. The rebels advanced like devils.  But when they come close to the R.R. they were received with repeated volleys from our division and the 3d div. which was also attacked.  No sooner did they start to retire than our regt with the 7th Mich. which had been deployed farther to the left sprang over the railroad and following them closely captured many prisoners. The 2d N.Y. took a stand of colors and there was another stand taken but I have forgotten what regt. had the honor of its capture.

It ws now nearly dark and well might we be glad of it. For Evell had now come up on our left, and Sykes with the 5th Corp. had continued his retreat on toward Centerville notwithstanding repeated requests from Gen. Warren that he would support him. And so ended the Battle of Bristol Station. A short but spirited little conflict in which the enemy were defeated with a loss in killed wounded and prisoners of about 1500 while our loss was not above 300. 22 were killed and wounded in our regt. only one of whom was killed. Our regt. took twice as many prisoners as there were men in the regt. Captain Ball was among the wounded and also Charley Berdah.

If a wounded man happens to have any money they steal it from him. And from them the money finds its way to the houses of ill fame and goes toward supporting the 6000 harlots which are now in the nations capital. And the other 15000 individuals who have no visible means of support.\nI have a well authenticated instance that occurred in one of the hospitals at Baltimore. A wounded soldier wanted some currant jelly. One of these good nurses told him that he could get him a can for two dollars. the soldier gave it although it was all the money he had. The nurse brought the can to him. and Lo. there was a label on the can showing that the soldiers own mother had sent it to him. and these infernal nurses had stolen the found mother's gift and sold it to her suffering son. I have on it best authority that these scoundrels have been known to quarrel over the body of a dead man for his clothing and other property. And I know myself that every pocket of soldiers killed in battle is rifled in less than fifteen minutes after it is safe to be on the field. If there is one individual more contemptable, meaner, and more deserving of death than all others, it is one of these pick pockets who straggle around among the dead and dying to pilfer. Imagine hundreds of poor wounded men crying for water, for a little help, while near at hand are hordes of these thieves cutting dead men's pockets.  The true solders are at their posts and can not leave them to help the sufferers. But these rogues can and won't. And this is truth is and probably always will be done on every battlefield.","d0012f2d59430432d966f97be04c0191.jpg"],[87731,"132\nTuesday Oct. 27th\nWe have been at work nearly all day cutting logs for our winter quarters.\nWednesday Oct. 28th\nWe have been at work building our shanty.

A dress parade at half past four.\nThursday Oct. 29th\nWork on our quarters, a brigade in the afternoon.\nFriday Oct. 30th\nWe were marched out to witness the execution of a deserter belonging to the 15 Mass. We formed a hollow square one side being open. A grave was dug on a side hill. Soon after we were formed we heard the band playing the dead march, and its slow solemn measure fell mournfully on our ears. Soon they came in sight and approached the end of the square opposite to opening and the grave. The ranks opened and let them pass through. first came the band playing the mournful dirge, then the guard commanded by the Provost Marshal, then four soldiers bearing a coffin, then cam the prisoner, attended by the chaplain, holding his hand on his heart. Oh! I can never forget the pitiful sight. That picture of despair as he came near enough that I could catch the expression of his countenance. death, certain, inevitable, immediate was before. Oh! let us not talk lightly or think lightly of such scenes as these. The party marched up to within about fifteen paces of the grave and halted. The band filed around and passed behind the guard. While the party carrying the coffin passed in front and laid the coffin in front of the grave. They then passed to the rear of the guard, and the prisoner came forward with the chaplain and Provost Marshall. After a prayer by the chaplain supplicating","a1dcae542e92d223377ec570543b2127.jpg"],[87732,"133\nto Divine Giver of all good in behalf of the poor prisoner now about to be sent to meat his creator.#  The prisoner eyes were bandaged, and he took his seat on the coffin shook the hands of the Provost Marshall and Chaplain.  the chaplain then passed behind the guard while the Provost Marshall took his stand to the right. The guard was then inspected.  After which the commands \"Ready,\" \"Aim,\" \"Fire\" were given in deliberate succession and the prisoner fell forward on his face. The guard had made bad work of it, and had not shot him quite dead. The reserve was then ordered up close and shot him through the head. After this the brigade passed the body in review and the Regts. filed off to their respective camps.  This is the 2d execution I have witnesses and I pray Got it may be the last. It is anything but pleasant to see an individual thus launched into eternity.\nWe had hardly returned to camp before we heard the sound of rogues march and a couple of fellows were drummed through camp with smoothly shaved heads.  This punishment was inflicted for forcing safeguard. It looks like military discipline is becoming quite severe in our army when we are called upon to witness two such enforcements of it in one day.\nSaturday Oct. 31st\nRain in the morning; muster for pay.\n\nThis always did seem like a mockery to me. It sounds like praying, \"Lord have mercy on this man's soul for we will have none on his body.\"  Or, \"Lord pity this man that we are about to kill.\"  However I doubt not that it is all right and proper, if we will kill him that we should pray for him at least.  But I verily believe that there are men who now pray for the souls of such unfortunates, who did they possess the power would pass a law inflicting eternal punishment in the realms of shade for crimes which are now punished with death. What a blessing it is that man's power extends no farther than it does. Man never attempts to judge of motives but bases all his decision on deeds.","21573cd8a5222ac8dff995fccdfb0875.jpg"],[87733,"134\nMonday Nov. 1st 1863\nThe day has passed without any thing worthy of notice.

Four companions built a house to length of shelter tents or about 11 feet and about 6-1/2 feet in width. High enough to admit of two bunks one above the other these were placed in one end in the other was a door and at the side a fire place made of stone and mortar. Here we could live as comfortably as the wealthiest in their brown stone mansions.  My comrades were at first three Norwegians. Ole Giberson Ole Johnson and Thomas Peterson. But afterwards Ole Johnson being detailed for brigade guard, and a Swede name Peter Borgh returning from the hospital he became my bunk mate. So we were named the Scandinavian mess.  My companions were all good sould fellows believers (with the exception of Gilberson) in ghosts, ghouls, wizzards, witches, genii, and devils, And hence I was entertained with many a long and dismal story all partaking the nature of that gloomy dark wilde dreary romance of peculiar to northern Europe. Gilberson was by far the best versed in these mysterious legends but laughed the idea of their reality to scorn. And in support of his doctrine told us many cases of his own personal experience in visiting these wonderful enchanted places and finding that all these ghosts were merely the superstitions of those weak nerved visionists who had discovered them. Borgh and Johnson both knew that \"there was such things in the old country.\"  Borgh had lived right by a mill. And one of these ghosts used to come and start the mill and work it at night. his","bcafbd0607991a8356315027e4d122ac.jpg"],[87741,"142\nown father worked in the mill and he went in there one night to see whether it really was a ghost or not and the ghost knocked him down. Johnson and another young man were followed across a lake one dark night by an awful ghost. They had been on a visit to their sweet hearts and had to cross a large lake on their return, and this great white ghost walked over the water across the entire lake and he believed that it was the ghost of somebody that had been drowned in the lake.  But my space will not permit me here to give one half of the stories of their own personal adventures, which they cited to prove the truth of their position. And here allow me to say that in the stories of no novelist have I found such wilde romance as in the legends which Gilberson entertained us during that Winter. For two month he never told the same story twice, and yet he entertained us for hours at a time with old rusty traditions of enchantments, witchcrafts, wonderful apparitions. Not [only?] so, but many comic yarns, far different from our modern comic stories, bearing the impress of ages, really laughable and witty, and this same wit, too, was often mingled in the darkest, wildest stories of supernatural occurences, making a most delightful variation in his narrative, in this he far excelled any novelist I ever read after. But Ghost and the supernatural were not his only themes.","585164f2dcf2715acaa71d74133125f1.jpg"],[87742,"143\nthe deeds of robbers with which northern Europe was formerly infested, their tricks of theft and escapes from justice, and every thing connected with these outlaws were all detailed in a manner calculated to please the most facthideons[?].  The early history of Scandanavia as it is kept by tradition, the adventures of mighty chieftains were all detailed and particularized as carefully as a historian would have done in the most labored work. How he ever acquired all this wonderful mass of lore is to me a mystery. I wish I had here space and memory to write a few specimens of his productions.

(I have written the above just as I find it in my Diary but I will here proceed and from memory will tell wherein it failed to hit anything). It was mean to be directed against Infidelity but not knowing infidel ground it entirely over shot them. I would here wish to advise preachers of the gospel to confine themselves to what they understand. If a preacher intends to attack Infidelity, first let him post himself as to what infidelity is. This he cannot do without studying carefully infidel works; Else he ____ where no infidel stands.  I know this to be true, because as an Infidel even an athiest, I have often listened to those sermons by persons totally ignorant of infidelity and have said he knows not of what he is talking. Hence it is","009eba9fea71921a304d368732b665ba.jpg"],[87752,"153\nthat the most successfull preachers in all ages have been those who were infidels themselves or at least persecutors of the church. This is true all the way from the Apostle Paul down. Our best temperance lecturers are men that have themselves been drunkards. Now observe I do not say that in order to be a good preacher a man must first be an Infidel. nor do I say that in order to lecture well on temperance the lecturer must first be a drunkard. But this I do say that whatever a man attempts to either praise or condemn, he must first understand, else he merely renders himself ridiculous in the eyes of those to whom he desired to carry conviction. I advise preachers to read, nay, study, the works of Voltaire, and Thomas Paine, and not only so but to procure the infidel papers of the present day and read them, that they may see their fallacies and point them out. And I further more advise them to study the works of nature that they may be able to point out the beautiful unison which really does exist between natural and revealed religion. An athiest you must first convince by the evidences contained in nature that there is a supreme mine overruling all this universe.

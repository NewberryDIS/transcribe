Sheridan and Capt. James F. Gregory of his\nstaff and Colonel Henry W. Farrar and myself.\n\n  It was the General's purpose to go to Cañon\n\nCity in order to see the Grand Cañon of the\nArkansas, through which the railroad had just\nbeen completed, then to Fort Garland by the way\nof Pueblo. At Fort Garland we were to get our","c671c188ab4c0491686604db4b771b84.jpg"],[62274,"7.\noutfit of wagons, ambulances, riding horses, camp -\nequipment, etc. for a thirty days journey. The exact\nroute from Fort Garland had been determined by the\nGeneral before leaving Chicago and marked on his\nfield map. He desired to follow the Rio Grande to\nits source crossing the mountains at Grassy Hill,\nvisiting Silverton and other interesting points in\nthe San Juan mining region, and thence to Santa \nFé by the way of the Animas Cañon, Animas\nCity, and Pagosa Springs. The information the \nGeneral had received before leaving Chicago from\nthe army officers at Garland and from reliable\nparties at Alamosa, Wagon Wheel Gap, Antelope\nPark, Lost Trail Station, and as high up as Grassy\nHill, touching the condition of the roads and the\npracticability of crossing the mountains at that\nseason of the year was anything but encouraging.\nI saw the letters and dispatches. They were\nfrom numerous sources - merchants, hunters, guides,\npackers - and the opinion was universally expressed,","337feb5db5cba5cfece95850d8376ac5.jpg"],[62275,"8.\nin the strongest possible language, that it was an\nutter impossibility to take any wagons and ambulances\nacross the mountains at Grassy Hill, Lake \nCity, or at any of the other passes in May or June.\nIt was reported that the snow lay to a great depth\non the summit of the range - that the weather\nwas cold and snow storms were of almost daily occurence\nthrough the month of May - that no attempts \nhad been made to break a raod for wagons\nat any of the crossings and that no attempts were\nlikely to be made before July. The day we left\nChicago while some of the party were commenting\non the unfavorable reports which had been received,\nthe General opened his map and putting his finger\non the Rio Grande about Antelope Park, moved it\nquickly to a red line which had been drawn from\nGrassy Hill to Niegoldstown and said in a quiet\ntone \"'we will cross there\".\n\n  On the twenty first at 4.30 P.M. we reached\n\nPueblo. At 5. o'clock we left on the Pueblo and","f8091413845e60f88b4030bed8cb721b.jpg"],[62276,"9.\nArkansas Valley road (narrow gauge) for Cañon\nCity, distant forty miles, making the run in an\nhour and forty minutes.\n\n  On the twenty second we had our breakfast\n\nat six o'clock and immediately after were conducted\nto a special train, provided for us by the coutesy\nof the Railroad authorities, and were soon off\nto see\nThe Royal Gorge\nof the\nGrand Cañon of the Arkansas.\nWe were accompanied by Mr. Scott, Superintendent of\nConstruction, and Mr Clark Lipe of Chicago, the contractor\nfor the building of the road through the\nGrand Cañon. The special train consisted of one open \nor flat car, which, in order to afford our party the best\npossible view, backed up through the Royal Gorge and \nbeyond it for several miles. The morning was bright\nand beautiful and the light breeze which prevailed\ncarried directly away from us the smoke of the engine","3c125fdfd79c03a09f7a27de7cc81b0c.jpg"],[62277,"10.\nso that we had a clear and unobstructed view. We\npassed the Soda Springs and crossed a long stretch of\nlevel plain. For a mile or more we kept to the Valley\nand followed closely the smooth and placid tho' rapid\nwaters of the Arkansas. As we proceeded the face of the\ncountry grew rougher and more broken, - the gently\nswelling knolls and ridges disappeared and formidable\nhills took their place which in turn gave way to towering\nmountains frowning above the Railroad track\nclosely on either side gradually hemming in the waters\nof the Arkansas which now ran with swifter current\nand showed upon its surface ripples and patches of\nfoam. Another half mile and we creep around the base\nof a magnificent granite cliff hundreds of feet high\nwith sides almost vertical and coming squarely down\nto within a few feet of the waters edge, leaving barely\nroom for the little narrow gauge track to pass it.\nFurther on the changes were still more marked. Bold\nmountains rose up to great height on either side, with\nwalls sloping backward and thickly dotted with a","a4718b90765a80bb1fe70804354ca592.jpg"],[62278,"11.\nstunted growth of spruce and pine, and the river on\nour left leaped and foamed and sparkled in the early\nmorning sunlight. Three-and-a-half miles from Cañon\nCity we turned abruptly the base of a ragged precipitous \nspur from the main range, - a little valley lay\nat our feet and beyond loomed up in majestic grandeur,\nthe lofty dead wall which marks the entrance to the\nRoyal Gorge. Rapidly now we approached this marvelous\ncañon - this deep, dark and awful pathway\nof the Arkansas River through the heart of a solid\ngranite mountain. Before we fairly realized the fact\nwe were past the gateway and were winding and\ntwisting between the rugged walls of the mighty\ncañon of the Arkansas. So much has been written\nand published concerning this cañon and as my time\nis limited I omit any detailed description of it. No\nimagination however can conceive the superb panorama -\nthe weird and grotesque forms amid these\nchasms of stone which seem ever crowding forward\nwith an evil minded will to shut you in; \"just a","2993a1b314aa9f946795d25f00dd5254.jpg"],[62279,"12.\nglimpse of blue sky far above such as miners see\nfrom the bottom of the black shaft\"; while below\nto your left the wild river flowed narrower and\nfiercer over and around the rocks, taking on its\nmad career every possible form of cascade. Occasionally\nfor a short stretch, the waters glide under the brown\nshadows of rock and bush, smooth, green and glassy,\nbut a moment later are torn into ribbons and scattered \nin glistening spray.\n\n  The distance through the Grand Cañon by\n\nrail is eight - through the Royal Gorge four miles.\nWe went as far as the Twelve mile Bridge and then\nreturned to Cañon City.\n\n  Mr. Clark Lipe, the principal contractor informed\n\nus that the work of grading through the\nGrand Cañon was begun October 1st, 1878 - that\nfrom that date to about May 1st, 1879. he had a\nforce of from two hundred and fifty to three hundred\nmen employed. The cost of grading and laying \nthe rails through the Grand Cañon, about eight","ba5438fe4dee20989d9edcb8fa9f29e5.jpg"],[62280,"13.\nmiles, was a trifle less than one hundred and\nforty thousand dollars to the mile. A great portion\nof the distance through the Grand Cañon the\nroad bed had to be cut from a solid granite wall and\nmuch difficulty was experienced in getting a foot hold.\nMen, machinery and supplies were lowered from the cliffs\nto the bed of the river by means of ropes, and often a\ndistance of from one thousand to fifteen hundred feet.\nWe saw at several points the great snubbing posts still\nstanding on the edge of precipices and although thirty\ninches in diameter and from forty to fifty feet in\nheight appeared to us, even through strong field\nglasses, not larger than ordinary fishing rods. It\nhardly seemed possible that men had ever been lowered\nto the bottom of the cañon from those heights.\n\n  The Railroad bed through the cañon, and in\n\nfact of the entire line was equal to any I had ever\nseen. The work was skillfully and artistically done.\nThe rails were of steel and the ties of oak. The\ngrade averages fifty feet to the mile for about","e1140eeaef66de6271e3e2e2c9627019.jpg"],[62281,"14.\neight miles. The Arkansas averages from fifty to sixty\nfeet in width and the bed of the Railroad lies from\nfifteen to twenty feet above it at high water,\n\n  It was but a few months prior to our visit\n\nthat the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad commenced\noperations in this cañon - opening for the\nLocomotive a pathway hitherto considered by the\nablest engineers impracticable - in fact impossible.\nUntil within a few months of our visit the dark\nrecesses of this mighty gorge were unexplored except\nat one or two points near the entrance, which had\nbeen reached in midwinter. It was regarded as impossible\nto traverse it from the river level, except\nin the few cases on record, during winters of unusual\nseverity, when the margins congealed to such\na degree that by great caution and with the aid\nof spiked boots and staves, a few adventurous spirits\nsucceeded in penetrating a little way always in great\nperil of slipping toward the central current which\nnever freezes. By the energy, enterprise and skill of","70393ed2eeb545b4fb948a14eeb87b4d.jpg"],[62282,"15.\na Railroad Company the difficulties were surmounted -\nthe cañon was conquered, and from the platform\nof a palace car the traveler could see the\nwonders and beauties which for all time hitherto\nhave been hidden from mortal eye.\n\n  At nine o'clock we reached the depot at Cañon\n\nCity; just in time for the Pueblo train. At eleven o'clock\nwe arrived at Pueblo and at two-fifteen left on\nthe Denver and Rio Grande Road for Fort Garland,\ndistant ninety six miles. We passed through the\nlittle villages of St Charles, Cucharas,Santa Clara,\nSan Antonia, Bodito and La Veta, the latter lying\nat the foot of the Sangre-de-Cristo range over which\nthe Railroad passed to Fort Garland, and from\nthence to Alamosa on the Rio Grande at that date\nthe terminus of the road. After leaving Pueblo we\nskirted closely the base of the Greenhorn range\nand within two hours arrived at the junction\nwith the branch road for Trinidad and El Moro;\nchanging cars to reach those points. At St Charles","f3fad3f01b4597a35b9ba35aeac763c0.jpg"],[62283,"16.\nwe crossed the River of that name, and for a number\nof miles followed the general course of one of\nits tributaries, Greenhorn River, which we eventually\ncrossed, as also further on Apachee Creek, a tributary\nof the Huerfano which flows into the Cucharas, a\ntributary of the Arkansas. For an hour and a \nhalf after leaving the junction we passed over a\nplains country wholly uncultivated so far as we\ncould see save in the villages and adjoining them.\nAs we approached the Mountains, after crossing\nthe Greenhorn, the country became broken and\nhilly. Scattered here and there to the west of our\nroute and between it and the foot hills we saw\nvast numbers of round topped buttes. Approaching\nthese we skirted the border of the fertile valley of\nthe Arrapahoe which lies at the base of the Spanish\nPeaks whose symmetrical forms loom up grandly,\nthe summit of one reaching an altitude of twelve\nthousand, seven hundred and twenty feet, and of\nthe other thirteen thousand, six hundred, and twenty","bd2bbe7edc8c6c3c0ee72a1f03cfd50d.jpg"],[62284,"17.\nfeet. Fringing the banks of all the streams, and\ndotting the sides of the buttes and hills were piñon\ntrees.\n\n  Ex. Governor Hunt of Colorado was a passenger\n\non our train and we found him an interesting\nand agreeable traveling companion. He was at\nthis time one of the most prominent men in the\nState and was the projector of the Denver and Rio\nGrande Road and also very largely interested in it.\nHe gave us a graphic history of the enterprise and\nthe troubles and difficulties which had surrounded\nit. At about five o'clock the train pulled up at\nLa Veta which is fourteen miles from the summit \nof the La Veta Pass.\n\n  Governor Hunt invited General Sheridan,\n\nColonel Farrar and myself to ride with him to\nthe summit on the pilot of the locomotive, which\ninvitation we gladly accepted. A couple of robes were\nspread for us on the narrow platform and we got\ncomfortably and securely seated while wood and","2af71d5248e3162f6560b4565c301d7c.jpg"],[62285,"18.\nwater were being taken aboard.\n\n  The La Veta Pass ~\n\n  In these days of progress there seem to be no natural\n\ndifficulties which cannot be overcome by the energy\nand resources of the Railroad Engineer. The tactics\nof twenty years ago have been abandoned. The long detours\nto secure easy grades over Mountain passes are no longer\nconsidered economical in Railroad construction. The\nshortest and most direct route is the desirable and\naccepted one, no matter how high the pass, or how\ndeep and inaccessible the cañon which bars the way.\nIf it be Mountain Range it is approached by the shortest\nline, and the heavy grades are overcome by using\nlocomotives of great power. Through the mountain or\nover it and never around it would seem to be the\nmaxim of the Engineer. When the Union Pacific\nRailroad reached and crossed the backbone of the\nContinent at Sherman in eighteen hundred and sixty","90002774d71203ad37b92b46945926d4.jpg"],[62286,"19.\neight, at an elevation of over eight thousand feet, it\nwas considered a marvelous feat in Railroad Engineering.\nSince then Railways have everywhere been built.\nTheir links of iron and steel stretch out across a Continent,\nbinding Ocean to Ocean, and tying State and\nTerritory together in eternal Union - traversing broad\nplains and deserts - following the foaming rapids of\nthe Arkansas through the dark and awful recesses\nof the Royal Gorge, climbing amid the clouds of\nKenosha Summit on the Denver and South Park\nRoad, at an altitude of more than ten thousand\nfeet, or marking a pathway to the regions of perpetual\nsnow, the La Veta Pass by the Spanish Peaks nine\nthousand, three hundred and thirty nine feet above the\nlevel of the sea. All these wonderful feats in railroad\nengineering, however, sank into insignificance when\nthe Denver and Rio Grande Road extended its line\ninto the San Juan mining region. The surveyed\nroute crossing the range at an elevation of over\ntwelve thousand feet and by grades hitherto believed","6083403d7adcfe690ac9c80f69809fd5.jpg"],[62287,"20.\nto be impracticable. At the date of our trip the Summit\nof the La Veta Pass was the highest point reached by\nany Railroad in North America.\n\n  Wood and water were finally aboard - the bell\n\nrang - the whistle sent forth its warning scream,\n\n  \"The bright steel arms flew out and in\"\n\nand we were off.\n\n  The sun was just touching the crest of the Sangre-\n\nde-Cristo range as we pulled out of La Veta and \nits rays streamed through the great rocky gateway -\nover the wooded slopes, spreading out to the valley\nbelow and upon the dense forests of pine, spruce and\nbalsam which surrounded us on every hand - flashing\nacross ridges and spurs to the South and resting upon\nthe snow topped summits of the Spanish Peaks\nwith a touch of light and glory. While life lasts I\nshall never forget the pleasure - the intense excitement\nof that ride. The evening was lovely, the air\nbalmy and just enough breeze stirring to carry away\nfrom us the smoke and sparks from the engine.","71f2693c86f0fd61b7795f8031362066.jpg"],[62288,"21.\nWe were all in a mood to enjoy to the utmost this novel\nride on the engine pilot. I sat on the right and at my\nside Colonel Farrar, next Governor Hunt, with General\nSheridan on the left. I clung to the iron brace or support\nwith my right hand and with my left over Colonel\nFarrar's shoulder aided him in keeping his seat. General\nSheridan rendered similar aid to Governor Hunt. Slowly\nnow but surely the engine creeps up, up, up, conquering\nfoot by foot the tremendous grade. Soon after leaving La\nVeta the road makes a sharp bend round an isolated spur,\nthen swings round the base of La Veta Mountain the altitude\nof which is eleven thousand, five hundred and twelve\nfeet. The curve is a gentle one but the grade increases\nas we advance. For one-and-a-half miles we keep to this\ncourse, a ravine lying on our left hand through which\ncourses Veta Creek. We twist in and out following the\nravine clinging to its brink and at the same time hugging\nthe mountain's side creeping up, up, ever up. The ravine\ngrows deeper and deeper and the creek fades to a tiny\nthread and finally disappears. Now we swing sharply","7de60f7c7cee143e09e470a2ce8ac526.jpg"],[62289,"22.\nto the right, rounding the base of a bold bluff, then\nturning abruptly to the left creep along the southern\nbase of Veta Mountain. The engine pants with labored\nbreath and struggles desperately with the heavy grade all\nthe time climbing higher and higher. - We sweep along \nat one point under the lee of a detached cliff, projecting\nspurs from which, hang over the Railroad bed. At another,\nthe mountain wall rises vertically to great height\nbleak and bare. - And now we approach the grandest\ncurve of all styled the \"Mule Shoe Band\" more than a\nmile in length. Straight ahead the road runs for half\nor three fourths of a mile, bordering the brink of the\nravine which has now grown into a frightful chasm,\nand turning abruptly to the left around the head of it\nin a magnificent graceful curve leads directly back along\nthe northern side of Dump Mountain forming a perfect\nhorse shoe. This I think is one of the grandest \npoints between La Veta and the summit. As we round\nthe curve at the head pf the ravine passing from Veta\nMountain to Dump Mountain the scene baffles description.","22f3841b0d6ce5bd14043206fb3d1a30.jpg"],[62290,"23.\nThe mountains close in on every side and the\nalmost perpendicular wall is crowned by a heavy\ngrowth of trees whose shadows envelop us. Beneath\nand frightfully near, is the ravine which we have\nfollowed from La Veta, now a yawning abyss, seemingly\nbottomless. Down, down on either side, forests\nof spruce and pine cover the rocky side of the chasm.\nAt one point we catch a glimpse of the old stage road\nwhich passes under the arch of stone round which\nbends the Mule Shoe. At Milk Ranch, Governor\nHunt informed us, the grade is two hundred and\nseventeen feet to the mile; and here we got our\nfirst view of Inspiration Point, and the Railroad\ntrack was pointed out skirting the mountain's side\nnearly one thousand feet squarely above us and\nwhich we are told will require a full hour to\nreach.\n\n  \"The Mule Shoe crosses the viaduct over the\n\nstage road upon a thirty degree curve of one hundred\nand ninety three feet radius and is the sharpest","3937ed3d9e6d87007a591f5f4aae1867.jpg"],[62291,"24.\nrailroad curve in the woods.

It was rebuilt however\nin 1861 by Kit Carson, who had command for several\nyears. Some of the quarters were of adobe, but they\nseemed in an excellent state of preservation.\n\n  On the morning of the 23rd after breakfast\n\nat the post, our camp equipage and baggage were loaded","1484ba62dc522e9a1a37312d0d047c17.jpg"],[62294,"27.\ninto wagons and ambulances, and we moved out a\nmile or more and established camp on a level grassy\nplat on the banks of a clear stream, - Ute Creek.

There were new mattresses, with","60d20712671280b447664dd870ee967d.jpg"],[62296,"29.\nheavy canvas covers, in which they were to be rolled\nfor packing, and upon which they were to be\nspread at night - fine new mackinaw blankets, \nthree pair for each bed with pillow and pillow\ncase for each mattress.\n\n  The two mess chests of General Sheridan's\n\nwere made expressly for him in Chicago, after a pattern\nbelonging to General Drum, and had seen a good \ndeal of hard service. They were used by the Secretary\nof War in the Summer of 1875 on his trip to the\nYellowstone Park. Each chest was fifteen inches in\nwidth, twenty four in length and eighteen in depth, and\nweighed when packed sixty pounds. The two chests were\njust a load for one mule, and on our trip from Fort\nEllis to the National Park and return, (above referred\nto) a pack saddle was made expressly to carry \nthem, one mule transporting them throughout the\nentire trip over the roughest trail I have ever seen,\nand without breaking a single article. Each chest\nwas provided with an outfit for six persons perfect","f2024b6c15dfeac0e142d8b86b3d8188.jpg"],[62297,"30.\nand complete of its kind, having a full set of the \nfinest crockery and glassware, knives, forks, spoons,\ntable linen, napkins, coffee and tea pots and coffee\nand tea caddies. There were three movable trays in\neach chest, every plate, cup, saucer, and goblet having\na compartment by itself, lined with some soft material\nheavily padded. There was also a table with\nadjustable legs which folded up compactly, occupying\nbut little space, and at which a dozen persons\ncould easily sit. There were also nine folding camp\nchairs comfortable to sit in and which took up\nbut little room.\n\n  The General brought along Mr. N.B. Smith,\n\nan employee in the Quarter Masters Department at\nChicago, who was to have general charge of the\ncamp, baggage and supplies. With Charles to cook,\nand Hackenjos to wait on us, nothing more could\nbe desired.\n\n  On the twenty fourth of May we had our\n\nbreakfast at 6 o'clock and were off at seven.","d1964aa7fd815a12bc14b70636f4c1f1.jpg"],[62298,"31.\nOur course was due West. Country almost a dead level,\nand as far as the eye could see, covered with a heavy\ngrowth of sage-brush. The escort under Lieutenant\nGuilfoyl kept well in advance and we did not overtake\nit until twenty minutes past ten o'clock at\nWashington Springs twenty one miles from Garland.\nReached Alamosa, the terminus of the Railroad, at\neleven thirty A.M. and stopped long enough to purchase\nforage for the command, and moving on\nabout seven miles encamped on the bank of the river,\nhaving made thirty four miles. The wind blew\na hurricane after twelve o'clock, filling the air\nwith clouds of sand and dust. Our tents were pitched\nwith great difficulty, requiring the united efforts\nof the entire force to keep them from being blown\naway. The country traveled over was extremely uninteresting.\nBetween Fort Garland and Alamosa saw\nbut one small house, and that, occupied by a man\nguarding a water tank on the Railroad. Nothing\nbut sand and sage brush along our route, In the","8831cdaab4ffe94f0acc0918278c569d.jpg"],[62299,"32.\ndistance could be seen the mountains bordering the\nSan Louis Park, many of them snow capped.\n\n  On Friday the twenty fifth, we made forty \n\nmiles encamping on the South Fork of the Rio \nGrande, fifteen miles from Del Norte.\n\n  On Saturday the twenty sixth, made but\n\nfifteen miles going into camp at Wagon Wheel Gap.\n\n  On Sunday the twenty seventh made twenty \n\nsix miles encamping at Antelope Park near\nGalloway's Cabin.\n\n  On Monday May twenty eighth, we pulled out\n\nof camp at the usual hour. The road we traveled from\nGalloways for a distance of twenty two miles, was\na new one, called the Antelope Park and Carrs Cabin\nToll Road. It was begun in the spring of eighteen\nhundred and seventy eight, and was still in an unfinished\ncondition. We found it very rough and\ndangerous and not at all practicable except for\nstrong wagons lightly loaded, and the best of\nstock. Reached Lost Trail Station, eighteen miles","9b285fe715e31ef8b2ccf531c69dd2a0.jpg"],[62300,"33.\nfrom Galloways, at twenty minutes past eleven,\nwhere we had lunch, and the General held a conversation\nwith the station keeper and a number\nof packers who had just arrived from Silverton\nwith large burros pack trains coming in by the way\nof Cunningham Pass. It was the opinion of all\nthese men that we could not cross by the Stony\nPass Trail with our heavily loaded wagons so\nearly in the season. The packers seemed much amused\nat General Sheridan's attempt to cross the\nrange so early, and with such an outfit. They asserted\nthat we would all be back within two days.\nWe heard that the station keeper had ordered up\nfrom Galloways an extra stock of forage to supply\nus on our retreat from Stony Pass. Lost Trail Station\nlies nine thousand, three hundred and sixty\nfeet above the sea. At twelve o'clock, our train\nbeing closed up, we pushed on, and after travelling\nfour miles came to the terminus of the toll road\nat Carrs Cabin. From this point the road was","382b6700ae4a4910008f33116c74a498.jpg"],[62301,"34.\nrougher and more difficult to travel than anything\nwe had yet seen. We struggled over it, however,\nas best we could and at quarter before three\no'clock reached Grassy Hill Station. The distance\ntraveled was thirty two miles - the hardest days journey \nwe had yet encountered. The wagons were not in\ntill six o'clock having been twelve hours on the road.\n\n  From Galloways to Lost Trail Station the\n\nscenery surpassed anything this side of Del Norte, -\nbut from Lost Trail to Grassy Hill, fourteen miles,\nwas grander than anything I had ever seen. The mountains\nand cañons of the National Park, which I thought\nunsurpassed, were nothing by comparison. We were\nnearly up to the snow line at several points, - fairly\nalongside the crags and peaks of the Mountain\nRange which divided and seperated the Atlantic\nand Pacific Slopes. I am unable to picture the dizzy\nchasms which lay for miles along our wagon\nroad, or the shaggy breasts of the mountain cliffs\nwhich rose about us. Five miles from Galloway's","eb5a65d81adccdc3027e9bf9035c3656.jpg"],[62302,"35.\nand just before crossing Pole Creek, from a great\nheight, we saw the Rio Grande divide, each branch\nbearing away widely separated but heading for the\nsummit. The left branch we could see for a long\ndistance twisting and winding at the base of\nthe gigantic cliffs like a silver thread till finally\nlost to view. We could truly say that we had been to\nthe very source of the Rio Grande, for within a \nfew miles from the point where the stream divided,\nboth branches were created by the mountain\nsprings and the melting snows.\n\n  Our tents were pitched close to the river and\n\nwithin half a mile of Grassy Hill Station, which\nwas kept by a Mr. Watson. He came from Egypt,\nIllinois to Del Norte in 1874, and to Grassy Hill \nin 1875. Owned a quarter section of land and had a\ncomfortable log cabin, which was said to be the\nhighest residence in the United States. Was interested\nin packing over the mountains to Silverton.\nMr. Watson said we might possibly get over the","36f7a86202fd74979e800b47de72afb7.jpg"],[62303,"36.\nRange with our wagons, but that it would be a \nterrible undertaking: the snow was deep - the road\nunbroken, and snow storms were of daily occurence\non the summit at that season of the year.\n\n  We had a rousing camp fire as usual and\n\naround which we sat till about nine o'clock and\nthen retired.\n\n  Tuesday, May twenty ninth, Calvert the\n\nguide, Watson and myself, left camp immediately\nafter breakfast, and hunted all day for Mountain\nSheep - Rode down to Pole Creek - sent the horses\nback by my orderly, and proceeded on foot. Hunted\nalong Pole Creek, and late in the afternoon followed\nthe summit of the main range back to Grassy\nHill. It was a hard days hunt. The altitude was\nso great, that it was with difficulty we could\nbreathe. For several hours we were above the\ntimber line and traveling over the frozen crust\nof the snow. We saw no sheep and but few signs\nand no tracks that I thought were fresh. We","111af64fc8d4bf0b78e373e77109b729.jpg"],[62304,"37.\nstruck the fresh trail of a grizzly and followed it\nfor more than two hours, but it finally led into\na cañon and we were forced to abandon it. We\nwere told by Mr. Watson that sheep were abundant\nin this locality, and that a great number\nhad been killed during the previous winter. We\nwere not fortunate enough to see one, however.\n\n  General Sheridan and the other officers with\n\nall the men reconnoitered the road to the summit and\nput it in as good order as possible. Had to shovel\nsnow in places, from seventy five to one hundred\nyards. Snow was found to be from four to seven\nfeet deep. The party returned late in the afternoon\nafter a hard days work and the officers unite in\nsaying that they had never seen so difficult a road\nto travel with loaded teams. General Sheridan\nsaid we must cross, however if it took a month.\nWe would not retrace our steps. There were two trails\nover the mountains from Grassy Hill to Niegoldstown\nand Silverton: one via Cunningham Pass, which","b137e56732b57b71aa0af51e3b4784da.jpg"],[62305,"38.\ncould be traveled only by pack animals, and the other\nvia Stony Pass, which was the wagon road. From\nWatson's to Niegoldstown by the latter route is six\nmiles. The trail by Cunningham Pass is longer by\ntwo and one half miles. It bears to the left from\nthe wagon road about a quarter of a mile from\nGrassy Hill Station.\n\n  We were to have a very early start on the\n\nmorning of May thirtieth, and had some hope\nof making Niegoldstown by night; but if we\ncould get over the summit and make the timber\nline would be content.\n\n  About half past six snow began falling\n\nquite briskly, and the wind swept down the\ngorge from the mountains in terrible gusts. We sat\nby the camp fire for an hour, but the wind blew\nso fiercely that we finally withdrew to General\nSheridan's tent where we sat till eleven o'clock,\nand then retired. At this hour the snow lay on the\nground several inches in depth, and was still","ae4e60f65801e48e7546c4adb3e1ee5b.jpg"],[62306,"39.\nfalling.\n\n  The Crossing at Stony Pass\n                    from\n  Grassy Hill to Niegoldstown.\n\n  The morning of May thirtieth broke clear and\n\npleasant. Our breakfast was served promptly at half \npast five, just as the dawn came creeping over the\nsnowy crests which surrounded and shut us in. We\nwere in the saddle at a quarter past six o'clock,\nand fifteen minutes later our train moved out of\ncamp. During the night the snow had fallen to the\ndepth of six inches.\n\n  About a quarter of a mile from Watson's\n\ncabin we commenced the ascent of Grassy Hill. The\nroad wound backwards and forwards around its\nSouthern base, zig-zagging, twisting, creeping up\nhigher and higher with the sharpest possible\ncurves. We were soon forced to dismount and advance","c996328504f550b3758be7690862d23e.jpg"],[62307,"40.\ncarefully in single file, leading our horses. In many\nplaces the road was very much tilted, and owing to the\nnew fallen snow, slippery; yet we managed to get over\nit on foot with but little trouble. For the ambulances\nand the heavily loaded wagons, however, it was no\neasy task. Our wagon master, skillful and full of\nexpedients, and who seemed fully equal to any emergency,\ntook every possible precaution against accident\nto the men and teams. One wagon at a time\npassed over the difficult and dangerous portion\nof the road, the others remaining near the foot\nof the hill. Ropes were attached to the body of\neach wagon, and at the side-hill places a dozen\nor more men would be placed on the side above\nthe road, and by a strong pull on the ropes were\nable to save the wagon from upsetting, although\nat times it seemed as though it would go over\ndespite their efforts. At points along the route,\non the steepest grades, from fifty to seventy five\nfeet was all the distance that could be made with","2610493babfb5d377ad6e770483a7cab.jpg"],[62308,"41.\nout a halt, to let the men rest and the mules\nbreathe. Whenever a stop was made, it was necessary\nto instantly block every wheel with a boulder,\ncarried along by the men for that purpose. The\nfirst stretch of troublesome road was over a mile\nin length, and terminated at a cluster of abandoned\ncabins, said to be one and a half miles from from Watson's.\nBy the united efforts of men and teams, the ambulances \ncame up without doubling, but all the wagons had\nto double, the two rear ones having fourteen mules\nattached, and only making it then by the most\ndesperate efforts. It was an exciting experience \nand wholly new to me. Fourteen mules hitched to one\nwagon, and struggling fiercely under the lash to\nhaul it up the almost vertical side of a mountain,\nwith a dozen men clinging to the wagon\nby means of ropes, to prevent it from upsetting,\nand as many more pushing at the wheels. Without\nthe aid of ropes and the strong force of men,\nneither the ambulances nor wagons could have been","c2755e2421768f67e56e4333924dbb8e.jpg"],[62309,"42.\ndragged up this mile and a quarter stretch. At ten\no'clock the entire train had reached the level plateau\nat the top of Grassy Hill, and was well closed\nup. The orderlies had built a rousing fire in one\nof the cabins, and another in the open air near by,\nand the General resolved to wait here for a time,\nto note what progress the teams made towards the\nsummit of the pass. If for any reason we failed\nto reach it or the timber line beyond, he thought\nwe might be glad to return with the animals,\nand occupy the cabins for the night. As there was\nwood in abundance, all could be made comfortable.\nAt nine o'clock it commenced snowing very hard,\nbut within an hour it ceased and the sun shone\nbrightly. At a quarter past ten, our train had\npassed the cabins and decended in safety the steep\npitch a few rods beyond. At the foot of this hill,\nhowever, was a ravine, one hundred yards or more\nin width, which was very soft. The ambulances\nand three of the wagons crossed it without much","169d93ae74e94f64450875e2849e43ef.jpg"],[62310,"43.\ntrouble, but then, so badly was it cut up, the\nrear wagon stalled and detained the train for half\nan hour, requiring finally, twelve mules before\nit could be moved. At eleven o'clock, the wagons\nwere closed up near the base of a hill, the steepest\nyet encountered, though short. Soon after the\nwagons had closed up at the foot of this hill, it\nagain commenced snowing. From our position at\nthe cabins, three fourths of a mile distant, we\nwatched through our glasses the movements of the\ntrain. The snow fell fast, and at times we were\nunable to see the wagons and teams distinctly.\nThe ambulances were taken up without doubling,\nand three out of four of the wagons, with twelve\nmules; but the rear wagon, which belonged to\nthe cavalry escort, and which was heavily loaded,\nwas stalled near the foot of the hill, and although\nsixteen mules were hitched to it and the whole force\nof men put at the wheels, they were unable to start\nit. For three quarters of an hour, we watched through","25dd1f0690999c04395a2c3cb4faba17.jpg"],[62311,"44.\nour glasses, the maneuvres of the wagon-master and\nthe men, in their efforts to start the wagon.\nGeneral Sheridan was nervous and impatient at the\ndelay, and finally, unable to stand it longer, mounted\nhis horse and telling us to follow, rode ahead\nat a rapid pace. For ten or fifteen minutes after\nthe General reached the stalled wagon, he made\neverybody fairly dance. The wagon-master's hands were\nfrozen, and he was completely discouraged, as were\nthe men, and presumably the mules. The wagon\nwas so heavily loaded, that double the number of\nmules could not have hauled it up that hill.\nWhen the General came up, the whole force was\nready to give up the ship. \"Unload that wagon!\"\nsaid the General. \"Throw off those tents! Pitch\nout those grain sacks! Roll out that mess chest!\"\nI have seen wagons unloaded quickly, but never\nbefore in my life did I see one stripped in so\nshort a time. \"Now, go ahead with the wagon\",\nsaid he, \"And you, men, carry those things to the","0391d841065631a1f48cd0a22b0ace16.jpg"],[62312,"45.\ntop of the hill.\" The mules took the wagon straight\nup without a halt, and in less than three quarters\nof an hour, the men had carried the packages\nto the hill top and reloaded the wagon. While\nthis was being done we had our lunch. At one\no'clock P.M. the train was ready to start, and we\nwere again pushing ahead. From this hour, the\nwhole command was hard at work, striving to\ngain the timber line, beyond the summit, before\ndark. Everybody worked with a will, and the\nGeneral took personal command. In my opinion,\nno one but Sheridan could have kept that wagon\ntrain in motion after two o'clock. He inspired\neveryone with his energy, zeal, and unflagging\nspirit. When he spoke the men took hold with\nnew life. At the sound of his voice, the mules\nput forth, seemingly, renewed efforts. I do not\nbelieve General Sheridan has had a better opportunity\nto show his mettle since the war.\n\n  After one o'clock, hill succeeded hill in","57b0e8722c1e8267285e3af19254cf25.jpg"],[62313,"46.\nquick succession, most of them very steep and\nextremely difficult to pass. I can yet hardly\ncomprehend, how we got up and over some of\nthe trying grades which lay along our route.\nHigher and higher we climbed, - doubling the\nteams now at every hill, unloading the wagons\nand lugging their contents up by hand. The altitude\nwas so great that we could breathe with difficulty,\nand the animals seemed to suffer equally\nwith ourselves. Until one o'clock, the snow fell at\ngusty intervals, but half an hour later, a terrific\nsnow storm came on accompanied by a strong\nwind, increasing in fury as the afternoon wore\naway, until it became a gale. It was frightful\nbeyond anything I ever experienced. The road, which\non the preceeding day had been cleared of snow\nand ice to the summit by our men, was rapidly\nfilled, and outside of the deep cuts through\nheavy snow banks, entirely obliterated, so that at\ntimes we were off the trail, and out of our","50846e79374ae61a8f4c7702077fb5c7.jpg"],[62314,"47.\ntrue course. Frequently, our route led us along the\nbrink of a cañon so deep that it made one dizzy\nand sick to look down it, and we were often in\ngreat danger of being swept over by the wind.\nBefore the blinding storm caught us, we could\nsee Mount Canby to the North of the Grand\nPass, or summit, and while this peak was in\nsight, were in no danger of losing our true\ncourse, but soon Canby and other adjoining\npeaks which mark the gateway of this route,\nwere lost to view. We could scarcely see ten feet\nahead. The snow came down in sheets, - the \nflakes were icy, and cut ones hands and face\nlike hail, blinding and bewildering us so that\nat times we were unable to face it. The wind\nshrieked and howled across the summit, - sweeping\ngreat clouds of snow and ice down upon\nus from ledge and peak above, threatening to\nbury us, or carry us off the cliffs into the\ncañons. The cold was intense. I never suffered","436ceb4c2655f5bd138c7bd6f55403f2.jpg"],[62315,"48.\nmore. Both of my ears were frozen, and nearly\nevery member of the party was frost bitten.\n\n  At two o'clock, and when the prospect of\n\nour getting through seemed most discouraging, and\nthe storm was beating upon us with terrific fury,\nshutting out from our view every land mark,\nGeneral Sheridan sent Colonel Farrar and Captain\nGregory ahead, with instructions to Lieutenant\nGuilfoyle and his detachment to return at once and\nhelp us with the wagons. Guilfoyle had been sent\nforward from Grassy Hill, an hour in advance of\nus with twenty men, provided with shovels, to\nbreak roads through the snow drifts from the\nsummit to Niegoldstown, and the General thought\nFarrar and Gregory would very likely overtake him\na mile or so beyond the summit. Without a\nword, Farrar and Gregory put spurs to their horses\nand galloped on, in execution of the General's\norder.\n\n  Hour after hour we struggled on through","9e9b2f287d221c686e576a40363f76c4.jpg"],[62316,"49.\nthis storm, unparalleled in my experience, and over\na road the like of which I hope never to see again.\nOccasionally, late in the afternoon, the sun burst\nthrough the snow and clouds and mist, lighting\nup the scene with magnificent effect. In these occasional\nlulls in the storm, the view on every hand\nwas indescribably grand. Range and peak were\neverywhere covered with snow. On our level, and below\nus in the gorges and cañons, the snow clouds swept\nby with lightening rapidity and for many hours we\nwere fairly enveloped in them. Never have I seen\nanything so grand, so sublime; and notwithstanding\nthe discomforts of the day and the gloomy\noutlook for the night, I enjoyed the experience.\n\n  At half past six o'clock we gained the\n\nsummit of the Rocky Mountains, by the way\nof Stony Pass, and the command was halted\nabrest of Mount Canby. The wagons and ambulances\nwere now closed up compactly.\n\n  At last we stood upon the broad snowy","334fba3a348f8de7d4ae309e92574152.jpg"],[62317,"50.\nsummit of the great dividing ridge, and among\nthe everlasting peaks, nearly fourteen thousand\n(13,831) feet above the sea. Westward, within sight,\nthe melting snows swelled the mountain brooks\nwhich flowed on to the Pacific Ocean; and behind\nus, within easy rifle range, they feed the\ntiny streams tributary to the Rio Grande, which\nafter a journey of more than three thousand\nmiles, finds the Gulf of Mexico at Bagdad. The\nsummit, or pass across the dividing ridge is\nprehaps a quarter of a mile in width. The mountain\nwalls at this point are not precipitous, but\ngentle slopes. Beyond these walls which mark the\npass rose rugged cliffs hundreds of feet above our\nlevel. The view spread out before us, from the\nsummit, was grand and inspiriting, yet constantly\nchanging. One moment the sun pierced through\nthe drifting clouds around us, lifting the snowy\npeaks from out their shadowy veils, and the\nlandscape glowed white and clear in the sunshine","9911cec3d918a2acbc449d11554c064d.jpg"],[62318,"51.\n\n  The next moment storm clouds dark as\n\na funeral pall swept over the summit and\ndown the gorges, - the sun was hidden, darkness\nand gloom surrounded us, the wind increased in\nviolence, and the icy sheets of hail and snow\nagain beat upon us with terrific fury.\n\n  The night was fast approaching, and\n\nmen and animals were exhausted. The General\nthought we had better encamp where we were,\nalthough neither tree, bush nor twig were in\nsight, as we were at least one and a half miles\nabove the timber line. No fires could be made,\nof course, and the prospect for the night was\ndismal enough.\n\n  The wagon-master, in the mean time,\n\nwent ahead to reconnoitre, and upon his return\nreported, that in his opinion it was not a mile\nand a half to the timber. He was anxious to\ngo on, saying, he thought the teams could\nmake it by nine o'clock. The men also seemed","5b49a6b00bf77511304a253d5c52aba4.jpg"],[62319,"52.\ndesirous of pushing on to some point where wood\ncould be found, even though they were compelled\nto work all night; so permission was given to\nproceed. General Sheridan and myself went on to\nlook up a camp. We found the descent difficult.\nLieutenant Guilfoyle had cleared the road as well\nas he could, in places cutting through snow banks\nfour to six feet in depth. We decended to the timber\nline, which we estimated at a good mile and a\nhalf from the summit, and selected a place to encamp\nopposite the first tree, a pine, about four\ninches in diameter. While we were working our\nway down we saw, below, some one coming toward\nus on foot. It proved to be Guilfoyle. He\nreported that Colonel Farrar and Gregory had\ncomfortable quarters, and would not return\ntill morning. Guilfoyle had in obedience to the\nGeneral's instructions, cleared the road from the","2e5b76270a1043e5d8777da2074ab4ff.jpg"],[62320,"53.\nsummit to Niegoldstown, barely reaching the\nlatter place, when Farrar and Gregory overtook\nhim with the orders to return at once. Although\ncompletely worn out, he started back immediately\nwith his men, leaving his horses in the valley.\nGuilfoyle said to me that he very much feared\nhis feet were frozen, and that he was nearly\ndead; that he wouldn't repeat his experience of\nthat day for a Brigadier General's commission in\nthe Regular Army.\n\n  After selecting our camp, I went back, by\n\nthe General's direction, to tell Colonel Sheridan\nto push on with the train and make the timber\nline, if possible. When darkness came on,\nthe train was over the summit, and down the\nslope about half a mile, but men and teams\nwere now so completely worn out and discouraged,\nthat the General ordered the command\nto encamp, which it was very glad to do, although\nthe prospects for the night were dreary enough,","309574cef941df0340f9934b542c45ff.jpg"],[62321,"54.\nwith no wood and no chance to pitch tents\n\n  Colonel Sheridan and myself went down,\n\nsoon after dark to the camp we had selected.\nThe ambulances were brought down to within\nfive hundred yards of us. A tent fly and some\nblankets were also sent down from the train\non a mule. Without removing our overcoats or\nboots we wrapped ourselves up in blankets and\nrolled ourselves up in blankets and\nrolled ourselves in the tent fly and passed the\nnight as comfortably as possible under the\ncircumstances, though we had nothing to eat\nbut hard crackers and bacon.\n\n  We were up by daylight on the morning\n\nof May thirty first. Had supposed our difficulties\nwere substantially at an end when we gained\nthe summit, but we found the descent fully as\ndifficult and more dangerous. From the summit\nto Niegoldstown the descent is very rapid,\nthirty eight hundred and forty one feet in two\nand a half miles. The greater portion of the","533001e7d2a9a00064106bdadd01bc05.jpg"],[62322,"55.\ndistance from the timber line, is a succession of\nsteep pitches, over which wagons, loaded or light\ncan only be passed by means of snubbing ropes.\nSome of these pitches are almost vertical. The\nfirst, and the longest and worst one, was below\nour camp some two hundred yards. It was called\nSnubbing Post Hill. Early in the morning, Col.\nFarrar and Capt. Gregory sent up from Niegoldstown,\na snubbing rope or cable which was\nfour hundred feet in length, and about two\ninches in diameter.\n\n  At nine o'clock our ambulances were lowered\n\nat Snubbing Post Hill in safety, and all\nthe men were sent back to the main camp to\naid in getting the wagons down to the timber\nline.\n\n  The modus operandi in lowering wagons\n\nby means of a snubbing rope, is substantially\nas follows; one end of the rope is securely\nfastened to the hind axle, all the wheels are","a2f87149b1d98d166b0cbd94842af086.jpg"],[62323,"56.\n\"close locked\", and but one span of mules is\nhitched to the wagon. The rope is carefully\ncoiled near the snubbing post, which is from\nfourteen to sixteen inches in diameter, and which\nis located a few feet back from the crest of\nthe hill and quite close to the road. Two or three\nturns of the rope are taken around the post,\nand ten or twelve men are placed within fifteen\nor twenty feet to handle it. Ropes are also\nwound around the body of the wagon, and\nfrom five to seven men stationed on each\nside to steady it in its descent, and keep it from\nupsetting. When all is ready, start the mules, -\ntighten up on the side ropes, - loosen gradually\nthe coil about the post, and the wagon,\nits load and the mules are lowered slowly,\nsurely, and with safety to the bottom.

Sometimes a wagon is let down too rapidly,\nand a stream of smoke flies from the post\ncaused by the friction of the rope. We had a\nman stationed near the snubbing post whose\nduty it was to keep it deluged with snow to\nprevent the ropes from catching fire.\n\n  At twelve o'clock none of the wagons\n\nhad reached the timber line, nor were any of them\nin sight.\n\n  At nine o'clock the General went on to\n\nNiegoldstown, leaving Colonel Sheridan to look\nafter the train, and I remained to keep the Colonel\ncompany and aid him if required. It was found\nnecessary to make a new road, and one was consequently\ncut out through snow banks from\nfive to seven feet in depth, and for a distance\nof one hundred and twenty five feet. It was\nfinished at noon, and the train was at once\nstarted. At half-past one o'clock, the wagons\nwere all closed up just below our camp of last","f096f5c6ad4580ea29556822be920e6d.jpg"],[62325,"58.\nnight, and an hour's halt was ordered, to give\nthe men an opportunity to cook their breakfast\nand make coffee. At half-past two, commenced\nthe descent of Snubbing Post Hill. The three four-\nmule wagons were lowered in safety, but the six-\nmule wagon was upset by careless handling\nwhich detained us half an hour. As this wagon,\nwhich belonged to the escort company, was moving\ndown to the crest of the hill and before it\nreached the spot where the rope was to be attached\nto the hind-axle, it got a start and shot\noff from the road squarely to the right, and in\nspite of the exertions of the driver and at least\nfifteen men, who were holding on to the side\nropes and the locked wheels, it seemed for a\nmoment, that the whole outfit would certainly\ngo over the precipice. The teamster hung to his\nreins with all his strength, and the darkies\nclung to the ropes, being dragged for several\nyards through the snow. At the critical moment","bfe94184e078bddef16381d2ba9fce5b.jpg"],[62326,"59.\n\n  , when it seemed certain that wagon, team\n\nand driver were lost, one of the darkies sang out\nat the top of his voice \"Hole on to de grub! Hole on\nto de grub!\". The men, seeming to appreciate the\ngreat necessity for saving their supplies, amde\nalmost super-human exertions, and stopped the\nwagon when the mules were within three\nfeet of the brink of the cañon. Everybody roared\nwith laughter at the exclamation, \"Hole\non de grub!.\"\n\n  From a point half a mile below Snubbing\n\nPost Hill to Niegoldstown, was one long descent.\nIt was not necessary however at any point to\nuse the snubbing rope. The wheels were all\nrough-locked and side-ropes were used, and it\nwas slow and difficult work to get the wagons\ndown. The last pitch, before reaching the\nvalley, was a full half mile in length, and it\nrequired skill and the utmost caution to pass\nit. We managed to get the ambulances through","5547b8ccd7ff084c4d09a474f400f945.jpg"],[62327,"60.\nto Niegoldstown by six o'clock. At dark, however,\nthe wagons were still a quarter of a mile from\nthe top of the last hill, and full three-fourths\nof a mile from the valley, and Col. Sheridan\ndirected them to encamp where they were.\n\n  Colonel Farrar and Capt. Gregory had\n\nfound comfortable quarters at the stage station,\nkept by one Simon Penrod, and had arranged\nquarters for the balance of the party. We had\nan excellent supper, and Mr. Penrod and his wife\ndid everything in their power to make us comfortable.\nOur blankets were brought down from\nthe train and spread upon the floors of the\ncabin and we had a good night's rest. Mr.\nPenrod came to Niegoldstown from Denver in\n1877, Served during the war in the First Pennsylvania\nCavalry, Gregg's Division, Sheridan's\ncommand. Was badly wounded and had never\nfully recovered his health.\n\n  It was twelve o'clock, noon, on June","009c10896d6d7ee10cf7b87bd7ad254d.jpg"],[62328,"61.\nfirst before the last wagon of our train reached\nthe valley near Penrod's house. In two and\none half days, therefore, our train had made\nbut six miles. Counting May twenty ninth,\nthe day of the reconnoissance from Grassy\nHill to the summit - and which was as hard\na days work as we had, and three and one\nhalf days were required in making six miles.\nSunday evening June first we reached Silverton\nand pitched our camp within one and a half\nmiles of that village, and near the entrance\nto the Grand Cañon of the Animas.\n\n  The Animas Cañon Toll Road was thirty\n\ntwo miles in length and had cost over twenty\nthousand dollars, and was not yet finished. It\nwas owned by a stock company. For many miles\nthe road was carved from the solid walls of the\ncañon. The Animas River flowed through the\ncañon, and the road clung closely to the stream.\nStarting from the location of our camp, at the","f16bf2affc78cb01a8e747717c6e9d3f.jpg"],[62329,"62.\nentrance to the cañon, the river falls one hundred\nfeet to the mile for two miles, - for the\nnext five miles, two hundred feet to the mile, - for\nthe next thirteen miles, one hundred feet to the\nmile; and for the last twelve miles, two hundred\nfeet to the mile. The average fall from\nSilverton to the head of the valley, or Animas \nPark, thirty two miles, is one hundred and fifty\nfeet per mile, or forty eight hundred feet for the\nwhole distance.\n\n  Past our camp, the Animas River flowed\n\ndue South, and within a hundred yards, entered\na narrow gorge of rock, formed from the\nwalls of the Sultan and Kendall Mountains.\nFrom our camp fire, at sunset, looking South\nand following the general course of the stream,\nalong the banks of which our road ran, the\nview was indescribably beautiful. The entrance \nto the gorge, or Grand Cañon of the Animas,\nwas rough, the ground being quite thickly","acd39cf8bb9390900dd769e1f5a77e4f.jpg"],[62330,"63.\ncovered with small pines. Further on, the walls\nof the mountains bordering the Animas rose\nhigher and higher, covered with a mass of green\nfoliage, - ridge, pinnacle and peak, one above \nthe other in rapid succession. Beyond, - further\nto the South, were mountain summits, round-\ntopped and sharp, covered with snow and clearly\ncut against the evening sky. Beyond all this,\nin the dim distance, other mountains of snow,\nthe summits of which were lost in fleecy\ndrifting clouds. Directly North of our camp\nwas Boulder Mountain, upon the crest of\nwhich the snow, apparently, lay to a great\ndepth, and at the base of which nestled the\nquiet village of Silverton. Heavy black clouds\nwere sweeping swiftly over the Northern range,\nbut occasionally, the snow-capped peaks would\nshine through, while every prominence reflected\nthe last lingering rays of the setting sun. I\nhave never yet in my travels seen anything more","95d3422fa483ba1070235cd059a370ef.jpg"],[62331,"64.\nfascinating. High up the mountains, on every\nhand, the snow had been falling at intervals\nall day.\n\n  As the General passed through Howardsville\n\nand Silverton, salutes were fired in his \nhonor and the people turned out en masse to\nwelcome him.\n\n  From a Silverton paper \"La Plata Miner\"\n\nof May thirty first, I clipped the following\nnotice:\n\n  \"Sheridan only Nine Miles Away\".\n\n\"Lt.

Made twenty five miles, and went into\ncamp at half past three P.M. The last of our\nwagon train (six mule team) was not in until\nfive o'clock.\n\n  We followed the Gand Canon for eighteen\n\nmiles. No words that I can command will \nfittingly describe it. I probably can convey\nsome idea of its beauty and grandeur, when\nI say, unhesitatingly, that other cañons and\nmountains seen by us on this trip dwindle into\ninsignificance in comparison with it.\n\n  The walls of the Animas Cañon rise\n\ntwenty five hundred, three thousand, four thousand,\nand at many points over five thousand\nfeet above the river and the road. Seven miles","563ee0fd2f3790b2b8cd8495bc9b4914.jpg"],[62334,"67.\nfrom our camp of last night we came to Elk Park,\nwhere the cañon for a half a mile, widens out into\na beautiful valley, then narrows again, with higher,\nsteeper walls than before.

After leaving Elk Park,\nand for a distance of eleven miles, the cañon grew\ndeeper and darker at every step, - the walls higher\nand higher, until one's eyes were fairly tired in\nseeking their summits.\n\n  There was every variety of scenery. For the\n\nmost part the cañon walls were not vertical,\nbut sloping, and covered with a dense growth\nof spruce, balsam and quaking aspen. At points,\nhowever, they rose squarely up on either side,\ntowering to the clouds, bleak and bare, with\noverhanging crags black and blasted at their\nsummit, or bristling with stark and guarled","cc3c93efd1f4a5c0ff7e64bab99b7978.jpg"],[62335,"68.\npines threatening to topple over and crush us as\nthey stood out in bold releif against the sky,\nresembling the high turrets of some ruined castle\nthat might be the hiding place of the winds.\nTiny streams, clear and cold, came bubbling out\nof crevices in the rocks, and mountain brooks\npoured over the rocky edges of precipices, so far\nabove us that the waters were mist and spray\nlong before reaching the level of the Animas.\nWaterfalls, fed by springs, came leaping down\nfrom rock to rock, forty, fifty, sixty feet at a\nbound, finally rushing across our path, to the\nriver, with resistless current. Hundreds of feet\nabove us the waterfalls could be seen jumping\nover a rocky barrier or apparently gushing\nfrom a solid wall, \"First, a silver thread; then a\n\"floating ribbon; then a wind-blown veil of spray\".\n\n  At our right for eight miles, then on our\n\nleft for ten miles, the Animas River rushed","9a3c97b4bb5b6857bcf37c71ff206480.jpg"],[62336,"69.\nmadly by us, over rock and boulder, in rapids and\nfalls, tossing its foam and spray high into the\nair.\n\n  After making eighteen miles, the road bore\n\noff to the right and away from the river, to avoid\nCascade Cañon which is said to be grander\nthan anything seen by us to day; I am not\nprepared to believe it. This cañon is considered\nalmost impassable, and comparatively few\npersons have seen it. Soon after leaving the\nriver we came to a frightfully steep hill, over\ntwo miles in length. It was a \"breather\" most\ndecidedly, but we finally conquered it. At points\nin its ascent, the views of the surrounding country \nwere lovely. Upon reaching the summit we \nhad our lunch, gave the animals an hour's rest,\nand then moved on four miles and encamped\nat the lower end of a chain of lakes. Our camp\nwas a fine one.

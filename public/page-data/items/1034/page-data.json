On the\nNorth Fork the bottoms are from on to three miles wide, and the\nquality of the grass is good for pasture, but unsuitable for hay,\nnot being sufficient in quantity. The bottoms of the Sweetwater\naverage about the same as those of the North Fork in Extent, but \nhave a greater abundance of grass, suitable both for grazing and for hay.","55f024e7dc2c0228a3c363e66de58ff8.jpg"],[69238,"152\nThe only stream of the three named, that overflows, as far as my\nobservation Extends, is McClellan Creell, the bed of which is too narrow\nto carry off the waters during rainy seasons, which collect and\npass through it from the Stared Plain.\nThere is no bottom timber on these streams, the only timber \navailable for fuel is found along the banks of the Creeks above\nnamed and their tributaries.\nVery respectfully\nYour obdt servant\nSgd L.

McClellan Creek water good in winter, a little impregnate \nwith gypsum in summer, plenty of it the seasons round. There is\nscattering clumps of cottonwood, smallsized and some scrub\nHackberry. No stone suitable for building purposes seen near Enough\nto be utilized. I think Adobies could be made, no coal.

There are\nsome bottom lands, but not Extensive, they do not overflow.\nThe timber is found immediately along the streams near the water.\nThere is but little timber in the vicinity suitable for building purposes,\nthe nearest point that timber could be procured for that purpose, I\nthink is on the head of the Washita or tributaries. Some timber\nsuitable for stockading could be procured on Gageby Creek.\n2nd. North Fork - about the mouth of McClellan Creek.\nThe water I think is slightly impregnate with gypsum and salt,\nthough in fall and winter it is scarcely perceptable to the taste.\nI doubt if surface water could be obtained the year round.\nI infer this from the fact that much rain has fallen during the fall\nthrough that section, and I crossed the river dry shod during Gen'l\nDavidson's last campaign, a small hole for watering purposes\nwas found just above. There is but little timber, variety Cottonwood,\nthe trees are small, no stone observed suitable for building purposes.\nI think Adobies might be made in places, though the soil is very\nsandy, much of the surrounding country is sandy and barren of\ngrass, much shin oak is found.

The bottoms are somewhat extensive and I think subject to overflow in places, wild grass for hay can be found. \n3rd.   Sweetwater, at the longitude of McClellan Creek I have not been but think that water could not be found so far West. East of this, say 15 miles and from that to near its mouth, the water is excellent. It is a swift running stream and I am informed that the Indians say it never dries, but an abundance of water is found there at all times. There is but little timber found for building purposes. I did not see any stone. Adobies I think could be made. No evidence of coal. The grass in places is very good, the country surrounding is more or less sandy. Shin oak abound to a considerable extent, the valley is not extensive, but little hay could be obtained, it is not much subject to overflow, the nearest timber is found on Gageby Creek or the Washita. There is less timber on Sweetwater than either McClellan Creek or the North Fork. I think there is probably more on the latter than on either of the other two. The grass I think is found most abundant on Sweetwater for grazing purposes and for hay on the North Fork.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                   (Sgt.)

Adjt. Gen'l Dept. of Texas\nSir:\n\n        I have the honor to make the following statement in reply to the questions asked by the Asst. Adjt. General, Dept. of Texas.\n\n1st.   I visited McClellan Creek twice in the year 1871. Water was found standing in large pools, but quite deep and sweet, the water near the mouth of this stream runs in the sand. In 1874 the stream was very much swollen on account of heavy rains. I think water can be found in the stream all the year round, but I don't think it will be running unless an unusually wet season. The water near the mouth of McClellan Creek is salty and brackish and in the year 1871 we were compelled to dig for water  for both men and animals of the Command a few miles below the mouth of McClellan Creek in the North Fork. The Sweetwater has good water about four miles from the mouth. I cannot say as to the permanency of the water in this stream as I was never on this stream about the longitude of the mouth of McClellan Creek except in a wet season but I am of the opinion that water can be had about 15 miles below the longitude referred to at all times. The North Fork never has running water except in wet seasons and as a general thing it is salty and brackish.","bc9af2cb5334dc880784e72e6a538691.jpg"],[69240,"2nd.   The timber on the above mentioned streams is Cottonwood, some little Elm and Hackberry on McClellan Creek , the most timber is to be found on McClellan Creek and the North Fork above McClellan Creek.\n3rd.    McClellan Creek cannot be depended on for grass, as for instance in 1871 we found several large bottoms of grass , in 1874 none was to be found whatever except on the hillsides or divides. The North Fork has grasses only in patches of a few acres and generally of a very poor quality. The Sweetwater has some very fine bottoms and more abundance of grass than either of the other two streams.\n4th.    I do not think that building stone can be had in the vicinity of either stream, although there is appearances of stone but in my opinion it is too soft to be quarried I think that soil can be had on either McClellan Creek or Sweetwater for making adobes. \n5th.    As a general thing the country is very much broken, the soil sandy and covered with shin oak, some parts of it good divides can be found with very short grass. In my opinion the country along the Sweetwater is considered as the best with the exception of timber.\n6th.    Not being versed in the science of Geology I cannot answer this question. \n7th.    I think fuel may be obtained in the vicinity of either for several years but it may necessitate it being hauled several miles. I do not think that  timber for building purposes can be had in the vicinity of either.\n8th.    Hay may be obtained on the Sweetwater but on the other two streams it cannot be had.\n9th.    Yes there is large bottoms on all these streams the largest are on the Sweetwater but few of them have timber they have standing water in them in wet seasons I do not think that they overflow, but in my opinion they are unhealthy and productive of  chills and fever.\nVery Respectfully\nYour obdt. servant\nRobert G. Smither\n1st Lieut. 10 Cavy.","7b600f24be295e0f8f6b360f7920effc.jpg"],[69241,"or no water in Sweetwater Creek in the longitude of McClellan Creek.\n2nd.  The Tinder is principally Cottonwood small size with some Hackberry and lies on the banks of the streams - McClellan Creek having the greatest amount. I do not remember having seen any large bodies of timber.\n3rd.  Grass in the vicinity of Sweetwater ample for grazing purposes and good but very little grass was found on McClellan Creek on the North Fork some grass was found but it was principally heavy coarse sand grass.\n4th.    I saw no building stone in the vicinity of either Creek and know of no soil suitable for adobes.\n5th    High rolling prairie with many breaks about the heads of North Fork and McClellan Creek, gypsum cropping out of the banks in many places. A very large extent of the country is sandy and covered with \"shin oak\".\n6th    I have never seen evidence of Coal in that section of the country.\n7th    I should think the Washita River near the mouth of Gageby Creek the nearest point for heavy timber (cottonwood) very little suitable for building purposes or fuel.\n8th    In the vicinity of the Sweetwater a small quantity of good hay could cut. On the North Fork the grass is very coarse and unfit for hay. On McClellan Creek there is no grass suitable.\n9th    There are no bottoms to all these streams. The bottoms of the Sweetwater are larger than those of either of the other streams, with no timber save here and there a tree - no signs of an overflow. On the North Fork the bottoms did not show signs of an overflow have but little timber and that of small growth.\nI am Sir very respectfully \nYour obdt servant\n(Sgt) Wm. R.

Late last fall, the Indians being away from their reservation, a military detachment was sent to procure their return. Finding them unwilling to go peacefully, the Officer indicated his determination to use compulsion in consequence of which a conflict ensued between the U.S. troops and the Indians.\n Soon after several peacable citizens and their families in the vicinity were murdered by Indians of this band. They then entrenched themselves in the lava beds in the neighborhood, fighting ensued and one or more severe battles in which persons on both sides were wounded or killed , and the U.S. troops repulsed.\n  Pending hostilities, negotiations were opened for peace and on the 15th of April last General Canby, Rev. Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Meacham at a point between the opposing forces, and in pursuance of a mutual agreement to that end, met Captain Jack the leader of the Indians, with some of the Chief Warriors, to discuss the term of a treaty, and while so engaged, General Canby and Mr. Thomas were treacherously assassinated and Mr. Meacham severely wounded by the Indians present upon that occasion. Battles followed and Captain Jack and all or most of his tribe have been captured and are now in the hands of the military authorities.\n  General Sherman, in a communication to the Secretary of War dated the 3rd, instant recommends that such of the Indians as have violated military law, be tried by a military tribunal.\n  This recommendation is approved by the Secretary of War. Instructions were prepared in 1868 by Frances Lieber, L.L.D., revised by a Board of Officers, of which General E. A. Hitchcock was president, and after approval by the President of the United States,","4181f4ab55e26069ff3ada1f5b8d0f5c.jpg"],[69244,"were published for the Government of the Armies of the U.S. in the field. Section 13 of the \"instructions\" is as follows:\n\n    \"Military jurisdiction is of two kinds - \n\nfirst, that which is conferred and defined by the statute,\nsecond, that which is derived from the common law of war.\n\n     Military offences under the statute law must be tried in the manner therein directed but military offences which do not come within the statute must be tried and punished under the common law of war.\"\n     The character of the Courts which exercise these jurisdictions depends upon the local laws of each particular country. In the Armies of the United States the first is exercised by Court Martial while cases which do not come within the rules and articles of war or the jurisdiction conferred by statute on Courts Martial are tried by Military Commissions.\n     All the authorities which I have been able to examine upon this subject, harmonize with these instructions. According to the laws of war, there is nothing more sacred than a flag of truce dispatched in good faith, and there can be no greater act of perfidy and treachery than the assassination of its bearers, after they have been acknowledged and received by those, to whom they are sent. No statute of the United States makes this act a crime, and therefore it is not punishable under the \"rules and articles of war\" and if punishable at all, must be through a power derived from the usages of war. Kindred to the act in question in bad faith, is the breaking of his parole by a paroled prisoner.\n     While the United States were at war with Mexico, several officers of the Mexican Army were tried by a Military Commission composed of officers of the United States army and convicted and sentenced to be shot and executed for breaking their paroles. Numerous trials of a similar nature took place during the war of the Rebellion but there are no statutory provisions whatever upon the subject and the whole power of the military authorities in such cases is derived from the usages of\n\nwar. \n\n     On the 23rd of August 1865 a Military Commission duly appointed, assembled in the city of Washington for the trial of Henry Wirtz, who pleaded among other things that the Military Commission had no jurisdiction over either his person or over the subject matter of the charges and specifications, being a tribunal unauthorized by either statute, military law, or well established usage.\n     But this plea was overruled and he was convicted upon several charges, one of which was murder in violation of the laws and customs of war and after sentence he was hung for his crimes.\n     All the proceedings in this case derived their authority and validity from the common law of war.","78b93153a3c50f31b17b069503e125e1.jpg"],[69245,"Certain persons it will be remembered were tried and convicted in the same way for the assassination of President Lincoln.\n\n  Attorney General Steed in discussing this object (opinion Vol. II page 297) says that we have seen that when war comes, the laws and usages of war come also, and that during the war they are part of the laws of the land under the Constitution. Congress may define and punish offences against the laws, but in default of Congress defining those laws and prescribing a punishment for their infraction, and the mode of proceeding to ascertain whether an offence has been committed, and what punishment is to be inflicted - the Army must be governed by the laws and usages of war as understood and practiced by the civilized Nations of the world.\"\n   Again - \"If the prisoner be a regular unoffending soldier of the opposite party to the war, he should be treated with all the courtesy and kindness consistent with his safe custody. If he has offended against the laws of war, he should have trial and punishment as the laws of war require.\n   A spy, though a prisoner of war, may be tried, condemned and executed by a military tribunal without a breach of the constitution.\n   A Bushwacker, a Jayhawker, a bandit, a war rebel, an assassin - being public enemies - may be tried, condemned and executed as offenders against the laws of war.\" \n   The laws of Nations, which is the result of the experience and wisdom of ages has decided that Jayhawkers, bandits etc. are offenders against the laws of Nature & War, and as such amenable to the military.\n   Our Constitution has made these laws a part of the laws of the land ( see also Vattel 359, Wheaton's International Law 416, Woolsey's Int. Law 220, Halleck's Int. Law 400) Milligan's case 4, Wallace page 2, holds under the circumstances herein stated, a Military Commission to be illegal, but the facts there are entirely different from those under consideration. Milligan was the resident of a state not in Rebellion. The Courts were open an unobstructed for his persecution. He was neither a prisoner of war nor attached in any way to the military or naval service of the United States.\n   According to the instructions referred to, no civil tribunal has jurisdiction in the case disclosed by the papers before me.\n  \n Sec. 40 and 41 therefore are as follows:\n\n Sec. 40:  There exists no law or body of authoritative rules of action between hostile enemies, except that branch of the law of nature and Nations which is called the law and usages of war on land.\n\nSec. 41: All municipal law of the ground, on which Armies, or of the countries to which they belong, is silent and of no effect between Armies","17f0e80794218ee629fed4c48323e65b.jpg"],[69246,"160 [stamp]\nin the field.\n\n         Manifestly these rules are, to a great extent, if not altogether correct, for it cannot be pretended that an United States soldier is guilty of murder if he kills a public enemy in battle, which would be the care if the municipal laws was in force, and application to an act committed under such circumstances.  All the laws and customs of civilized warfare may not be applicable to an armed conflict with Indian tribes upon our Western frontier, but the circumstances attending the assassination of General [strike] Canby and Thomas, are such as to make their murder as much a violation of the laws of savage as of civilized warfare, and the Indians concerned in it fully understood the baseness and treachery of their act.\n         It is difficult to define exactly the relations of the Indian tribes to the United States, but as they have been recognized as independent communities for treaty making purposes, and as they frequently carry on organized and protracted wars, they may properly, as it seems to me, be held subject to those rules of warfare which make a negociation for peace after hostilities possible, and which make perfidy like that in question, punishable by military authority.\n         Doubtless the war with the Modocs is practically ended, unless some of them should escape and renew hostilities; but it is the right of the United States, as there is no agreement for peace, to determine for themselves, whether or not anything ought to be done for the protection of the country, or the punishment of crimes, growing out of the war.\n         Section 59. of said Instructions is as follows: -\n\n\"A prisoner of war remains answerable for his crimes committed against the captor's army or people, committed before he was captured and for which he has not been punished by his own authorities.\"\n\n         The conclusion therefore is, that a Military Commission may be appointed to try such of the Modoc Indians now in custody as are charged with offences against the recognized laws of war, and that if, upon such trial, any are found guilty, they may be subjected to such punishment as those laws require or justify.\n                                                                            (Sgd) George H.

Latanta? has been turned over to the Governor of Texas, but only as I suppose - to serve out his unexpired term in the Penitentiary of Texas. His sentence was commuted, I believe to imprisonment for life and I have no idea that he will be Executed, and if any further information can be elicited favorable to him, his punishment may be still further mitigated. \nI think it would be a good thing to ease down on the parties hostile at present and during the summer, and make the scope of the Military Commission embrace but a few cases; and if you and the Secretary of War will only consent to let me send such as I would like to select for imprisonment or surveillance, to some of the Forts on the seacoast, I am sure we can break the war spirit of the tribes Effectually in the way and without shocking any philanthropy sentiment in the country. There would be no objection to let the immediate family of such as were selected, go along. \nIt is very necessary, in fact absolute necessary, and Even demanded by the Indians who remained at peace, that those who went out this summer shall be punished.","05aa73eab6a187b67c2ee84285f656c7.jpg"],[69251,"165\nWichita Agency, directing these Kiowas to return immediately, this they positively refused to do and failed to do.   The following issue day Satanta was still absent.  On Friday, August 21., Gen'l. Davidson went to Wichita Agency, to arrest Big Red Foot and his band, who were hostiles and had come into that Agency, while engaged in attempting this arrest, the Kiowas under Woman's Heart, Poor buffalo, and Double Vision, they party to which Satanta had allied himself, began firing on the rear of the troops, this party was headed by Lone Wolf - who had been secreted in their camps - and who influenced the whole party of Woman's Heart, Satanta and other before mentioned.\n\n         After the Wichita Agency affair, Satanta and his people, instead of returning or remaining by himself with family as the Com'r of Indian Affairs states he has been informed, went up Pond Creek and joined the following hostile Chiefs:\n\nKiowas: [underline]\nLone Wolf                                  /\nBig Bow                                    /\nSwan                                        /     all hostile from the beginning\nQushada Tanhousen                 /\nRed Otter                                 /\nPoor Buffalo                             /\nWoman's Heart                        /  all had been enrolled, left Camp\nDouble Vision                           /  and joined Lone Wolf, before\nSatanta                                    /   Wichita Agency affair.\nComanches: [underline]\nMohway                                   /\nTabernanilka                             /\nBlack Duck                              /     all hostile from the beginning\nLittle Crow                               /\nWhite Wolf                               /\nBig Red Foot                           /\n\n  They remained camped together through the remainder of August and early in September in the driection of Antelope Hills.  On Sept. 9. 10, 11. and 12, Capt Lyman's train was attacked by Kiowas and others, and not until Oct. 3rd. did Satanta come in to the Cheyenne Agency, with a number of hostiles who has never been enrolled.  Whilst it is difficult to procure positive evidence that Satanta was in that fight, he was unquestionably with the same party for five weeks and it would be more difficult ot prove that he was not engaged in it.\n            It must also be stated that when Satanta and other","c699d1cc2a611c4e2c209f0ada973957.jpg"],[69252,"Chiefs went away, two men were killed near their camps (within three miles), it has since been proven (and can be established) that some member of his party, led by a young brave named Kohtiason killed these two men, two other murders were committed about the same time within eight miles of this Post.   Whilst it is difficult to establish that this same party killed the,  there is every reason to presume that hey had a hand in it.\n\n    The Comm'r of Indian Affairs is certainly and positively misinformed as to the idea that Satanta was frightened off by the Wichita Agency affair, it occurred August 22nd.  Satanta left his camp for the Wichita Agency on the 13\" or 14\" of August.\n     It was the going away of Satanta and party, that brought about the Wichita Agency affair, it was this same party who fired on the troops and that were in Company with Lone Wolf and under his control and direction.  This, after they had been expressly told, that they must not hold communication with the hostiles.\n        I desire to state that all the above facts can easily be established.\n                                                         (sgd) Geo.

Dep't. of Texas,\n\nFort Sill, I. T. Nov. 26, 1875\nRespectfully returned to Hdqrs. Mil. Div. Mo. -- Attention is invited to the Endorsement of Capt. Sanderson, 11\" Infy. who is more familiar with facts and transactions, connected with the Indians on this reservation for the past two years, than any other man.  It has never been urged by anyone, I believe, that Satanta had any claim to mitigation of the punishment awarded him, or was justly entitled to mercy of any kins, and his temporary release from the Penitentiary, was granted not from consideration to him [3 word underline], but as a kind of bribe to his tribe to cease depredating in Texas, and upon the pledge of the tribe that it would do so.\nHowever that [strike 2 words] In case it did not however Satanta was to be returned to the Penitentiary or \"others equal to him\".  The latter clause of this condition is of course worthless, as even Indians - unfortunately sometimes -  cannot be picked up and sent to the Penitentiary without a trial, and Indians convicted of raiding into Texas would hardly escape with the Penitentiary.   The question as to whether Satanta himself became hostile again or not, was not considered, and did not enter at all into the condition of his release.  There is no question as to Kiowas having raided in Texas since his release - and there is no question as to the course of Satanta, if the Indians had had a show of success.  Had he been so disposed, he could have come in with White House and other Kiowas, who","77e7643d45d2d51c25f3bf17527d1187.jpg"],[69253,"167\nasked to come in before the tribes had effected anything.  But he waits until every attempt of the Indians had failed, before he left them to come in to surrender.  It is not understood that Satanta himself complains that he is unjustly dealt with, neither does his tribe make such complaint.  This attempt to keep him out of the penitentiary is believed to originate with the same parties and in the same spirit that prompted the efforts made to the Governor of Texas to commute his original sentence of death to confinement in the Penitentiary for life and to which he modestly [strike] unfortunately yielded.\n\n                                                            (Sgd) C.

By virtue of the instructions that I have received from my Government you will favor me by informing me in answering what your intentions are -- since we are disposed to undertake the persecution of the Indians and Thieves on the Mexican Line and to make the necessary agreement with the American authorities, and work in Common accord in this matter which is of general interest.\n                 I also wish to avoid the alarm in which the villages are thrown by observing the frequent invasions of the American forces, and I request that you will abstain from repeating them, because the act is irregular until permission has been granted by the Government of the Nation, through the proper channels to which they are inclined, considering the good feeling that Exists between the sister Republics.\n\n3187 D.

If these troubles continue however, it will be advisable to Establish such a Camp and beyond even the Otter. My recollection of the terms of the Contract with the transportation - contractor is, that he can be required to take supplies beyond the Posts a hundred and fifty miles. If this ve so, the supplies for such a Camp can be loaded at unknown and taken directly to it, and there will be no necessity for purchasing additional mules. In this event I would bring up some Infantry from Fort Brown, I wish you would have Supplies for MacRenze's command sent to Camp supply, he may unknown over there- say thirty days for five hundred men and animals. The Born Contractor here informs me, that there need be no anxiety about born here after the 12th inst. when his trains begin to arrive. Buell camped fifteen miles from here last night and I hope with be in before the maid leaves = 12 o'clock today = I can then inform you what orders he has from McRenze's. I shall not interfere with any definite orders he may have received from him, as it may derange his plans. When Daridson's Command get off Sunday date th? I shall go to the Wichita Agency to see how affairs are there. Will return here on Saturday. Buell's command will have to be fitted out with supplies from this past?, I presume. I can be done. He is very short of transportation for his Command, has thirty wagons. I do not believe he can carry over fifteen days supplies though will last twenty if necessary twenty days, and will enable him to reach MacRenze's Supply Camp, where MacRenze's can, if he desires, add to his transportation. The Enclosed copy of a letter from Captain Lawson, Commanding at Wichita Agency is this moment received and is respectfully enclosed. Buells is just in. I find that his operations are not limited by any specific instructions from MacRenzie and shall therefore arrange him hereafter as to his future movements. The mail is waiting and I will write further by the Friday! mail, very respectfully yours, (Sgd) C.C.

It is to be hoped they will be successful.  A now comes this new complication of a portion of the Commanches driven from this country for their crimes, attempting to avail themselves of a  Mexico as a refuge from further pursuit and as a safe retreat from which to commit further depredations.\n    I cannot believe, General, that the Mexican Government will permit this source of irritation to continue, or that it will delay taking efficient measures to either immediately and definitely stop these depredations, or to compel these Indians to return to their own Country.\n    I address you, General, as the officer Commanding on the Rio Grande frontier, and as, I presume, the person to take action in such matters.  I especially request, that the young children whose capture is referred to and who have been seen at Remolino, may be taken charge of and returned to the Commanding Officer at Fort Duncan, at Eagle Pass.\n     I regret exceedingly my necessary absence from San Antonio at the time of your visit to Piedras Negras.

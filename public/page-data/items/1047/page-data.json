Patteson, Colonel's John B Hogan, John A Campbell,\nAlbert J Pickett, & James E Belser; Judge Benson,\nMajor's T.J. Abbott & Donegan\nand other Gentlemen;\ntogether with the undermention'd Chiefs of Tuckabatchie town\nYoung King, Little Doctor, Yarja Sich-e Colonels, Mad Blue\nMad Deer, (Osooche Fixico, or Hatchee chubba Tom, struck through)\nand others\nOn the 30th May 1836.\nHo-poe-thle Yoholo said at the City of Washington in the\nWinter of 1832 he saw and conversed with the President of the\nUnited States Genl. Andrew Jackson. The President there informed\nhim after the making of their treaty, that by the terms of it at the\nexpiration of Five Years from the date of its conclusion, if his People the Creeks\ncontinued to reside where they then were, they must necessarily become\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the State of Alabama and be govern'd\nby its Laws, otherwise they must move beyond the bounds of the\nMississippi and settle themselves in a new Home. Which course,\nhe thought, would be most beneficial for them. Before the expiration\nof this term of Five Years however, the Whites had come in, in great\nnumbers among them and thenceforward there had been much trou=\n=ble and confusion. In consequence of this State of things he\nhad in the mean time, in accordance with the counsel of friends\ngone to look for a home beyond the Mississippi: during his absence\ngreater troubles had grown up, and more confusion among his\npeople arisen on account of the transfer and sale of their\nreservations, for, on his return he found that the Whites were swind=\n=ling them out of them; on that account he had requested Dr.\nMcHenry at that time certifying Agent, to forbear from certi=\n=fying to contracts for the sale of them, for he had discovered","5736fbb004ec1284880ed11ab5184b51.jpg"],[69807,"that it was no uncommon thing for one Indian to be instigated to\nassume the name of, and personate another, and sometimes to sell and\nstand up to be certified to several tracks of Land, of not one of\nwhich he was in reality the owner. He had written to the Presi=\n=dent on this subject: he had asked for an investigation and desired\nenquiry to be made into it; he had also in order to prevent a repetition\nof such conduct, requested the President not to permit of certifying\nto contracts, except in the presence of discreet Chiefs, and was much\ngratified to find that latterly that source had been adopted.\nThe land Speculators in order to get the Indians' reservations\nof land would harden the people against the Counsel of the\nChiefs and sell to the Indians Pistols and Powder, Knives and Lead,\nwould give bad counsel to them, and say to them, \"if the Chiefs attempt\nto restrain or interfere with you, Kill them; and that in this way\nthe late depredations and disturbances, that had so suddenly and\nin so unlooked for a manner broken out in the Nation, had been\ncreated and produced.\nAt the time of the Meeting that had been appointed to take\nplace at Dr. McHenry's for the holding of the investigation asked\nfor, concerning the frauds that had been committed upon the\nIndians in the sale of their lands, he was himself sick and unable\nto attend, but sent word that the Chiefs generally, and for the most part\nwere apprised of the affairs of their people, and therefore knowing who\namong them had actually sold, and who not, could assist in\nmaking a proper report of them. Tuskehenehaw of Tucka=\n=batchee was present at this meeting hiding about in the bushes\nand General Woodward and Captain Walker were also there putting\nit into Tuskehenehaws head to make the Indians beleive that\nthose among them who went before the Agent to make complaint\nabout the fraudulent sale of their lands would be the very persons\nwho would be taken, and sent immediately off to Arkansas.\nWalker and Woodward were furthermore at the same time\nmaking papers also, out in the bushes for the Indians there, telling\nthem that what the Agent might do for them would be of no account,\nbut that the papers they were making for them would secure them.\nBy their treaty made with the President it remained with\ntheir people, after the expiration of the Five Years either to stay\nupon their lands under the Law of the State, or remove Westward\nto a new Home; in either event he had been anxious for the people","03387821a78fffa6f5ed0d598ffa522b.jpg"],[69808,"The paper alluded to by Opothle yoholo, was of unclear the talk\nascertained to be some old proclamation unclear during the last\nwar with England by Sir Geo. Cockburn commanding the\nEnglish fleet, & was highly inflamatory & addressed to the\nCreek Indians and was no doubt the cause at that time of\nexciting them to make war on the whites. Where these old\nproclamations could have been lying all this time is not yet\ndiscovered: But an Englishman who is a silversmith & resided?\nfor some time in Columbus Geo. was the man who rode among the\nIndians & read & explained these papers but took care to conceal\nthe date, he is now in person in Montgomery jail, this man says\nhe is the natural son of Francis the Prophet, hung by order of Gen. Jackson\nand was borne in London at the time Francis visited England.","9bb81ae56e1341d549251094593d6c4a.jpg"],[69809,"to be allowed the benefit of what was rightfully their own\nand to this end, the investigation was desired by him, and it had\nbeen his earnest hope that it would have effected it. He had oftentimes\nattempted to procure a general meeting of the Tribe of Tallassee\nhaving a desire to talk with them, but was as often foiled, they\nappearing to have an idea of what he wished to converse about:\nand being also more immediately under the influence of Tuske-\nhenehaw anxious to avoid it. An opportunity being at length\nafforded, he appeared unexpectedly at their meeting and finding Tuskehe=\n=nehaw with them remonstrated with him about the evil course\nhe was pursuing, telling him that the pernicious talks he was making to\nthe Indians, were not his own talks and did not originate with\nhim, but were derived from others of whom he was the dupe, and\nthat if he thus obstinately persever'd in such course it must\nnecessarily end in consequences that would be ruinous, and that\nall would be afflicted with sorrow for. Tuskehenehaw not=\n=withstanding continued stubborn, and afterwards proceeded in\nthe same way he had begun, disregarding his friendly remonstrance;\nand the events which he had so much fear'd on account of\nit, had unhappily of late become realized. Flying rumours\nof contemplated disturbances had occasionally passed amongst\nhis people, but they were considered by them as unworthy of\ntheir beleif: they did not open their ears to them. Now indeed the as=\n=tounding facts had broke out upon them. He had received\ninformation of a matter which he had been unable properly to compre=\n=hend: it was concerning a paper or letter, said, or pretended to have been\nsent from People beyond the Seas; this it was said had been circu=\n=lated in some of the Indian towns: he had heard that it had been\nsent to Kun-char-te-Micco, to Enehar-Marth-looche, to Neah-Micco, and\nthat Tuskehenehaw had also received it: he was informed\nthat runners had come from Nehar Micco to Tuskehenehaw bring=\n=ing four broken sticks to him, and word that \"they were ready,\"\nand it appeared that it was about the time of the last of these\nbroken sticks that hostilities had commenced among them. *\nThe circumstance of the paper said to have been circu=\n=lated he could not, as he had before said, well understand; it\ncould not have been the work of Indians, for they cannot read\nor write, the only way in which he can account for it is, that\nWhite people must have been at the bottom of it. His people","87fa2a9d039080851ab567b1f9e4607a.jpg"],[69810,"had agreed with Colonel Hogan the Superintendant and Agent,\nthat they would emigrate with him during the present Spring; some\nof them however had been desirous of making a cross first and\nputting off going untill fall afterwards; this had been suggested to\nColl. Hogan but he would not listen to it, and said they must not\ndefer the time of their removing beyond the Spring, that the grass\nwould be sufficiently grown then to feed their Poneys upon. They\nmust prepare to start by that time; it would be the best season\nfor them and they ought to avail themselves of the advantage of\nit and be off. That to facilitate their removal he had pro=\n\nmised to interest himself in the procuring if possible the pay\n=ment of their annuity for the present year by that time, but although\nas they had been informed he had endeavored to do so, he had\nnot been successfull, no law having then been past authorising\nand appropriating it. The time contemplated for their removal\nhad also passed, the people in expectation of it had not planted\nand were already in a state of great want on account of it;\nthey were generally both willing and desirous of emigrating, and would\ngo into Camp if the opportunity was afforded them: that owing to\nthat diversity of sentiment ever entertained by men in regard\nto the propriety of particular measures, it was not to be expected\nthat all would be unanimous in the matter, but he thought\nthat those who had hitherto said they would not go might\nby possibility be influenced by the example of the others\ngoing into Camp, if Camps were open'd for them: and although\nsome of this mind might be reluctant yet, he did not think they\nwere spoiled, that is, that their repugnance to emigrating was invincible,\nbut might by such means be overcome.\nHe wished to make particular remarks on one subject\nwhich deeply affected their condition as a people and interests, it\nwas in regard to the quantity of Ardent Spirits that was continually\nintroduced among them. Beyond doubt it was one of the leading\ncauses of their debasement and misery, and tended infinitely\nto the procreation of mischief and disturbance. He was\ndesirous in the event of their going into Camp that the dealers in\nthe commodity might not be allowed to bring or sell it among them;\nin the absence of the cause they would of course be releived from\nthe banefull and destructive effect.\nAnother subject too, he would also invite attention towards.","7bc7617e71bdcce69dfd3d78321b0379.jpg"],[69811,"also invite attention towards. Claims were not unfrequently\nset up by their White brethren against the Indians: these too\noften were founded neither in truth nor justice, often where\nnot a cent was due on account of them. To satisfy such demands\ntheir Horses were sometimes seized upon, sometimes their money;\nthis too arbitrarily and without sanction of Law: at other\ntimes they were threatened with the consequences of the Law or\nthe confinement of a Jail, and in such manner their substance\nwas extorted out of them. Oak-fuske Yoholo the prisoner\nlately Killed in Tallassee while attempting to effect his escape,\nhe had every reason to beleive had been excited to anger\nand made mad by some circumstance of this kind.\nTo proceedings so arbitrary and the introducing, and\nselling such floods of Liquor amongst them, he thought a stop\nshould be put; they could then in more order and quiet com=\n=plete their necessary arrangements for going away.\nWhen the late hostilities broke out his people were\nengaged in gathering up their Cattle that were dispersed in\nthe woods in order to dispose of them in expectation of their\ndeparture. They had not finished this gathering when news\nof the hostilities reached them, nevertheless they immediately\nquit hunting their Cattle and hastened to the relief of their\nwhite friends; nor did they cease from aiding them untill\nby their exertions most of the deluded and guilty depredators\nupon the lives and property of the Whites in that section\nof country had been either made prisoners and turned over\nto the custody of the Whites, or expelled the neighbourhood\nthrough fear, to places remote and unknown to them, and\nwhere as was supposed the main body of their enemies\nhad secreted themselves and absconded.\n(Hopoethle Yoholo being here asked by the Governor whether he would\nbe willing to continue to lend his usefull aid to the Commanding Genl.\nPatteson, then present at the interview, answer'd) Neah-Micco and\nTuskehenehaw are responsible for the influence of the evil counsels\nthey have been instrumental in disseminating among the Red People:\nby their conduct they have become deeply involved in the creating\nof the present passing events, have been actors in them, and ought\ntherefore to be chargeable with some of the troubles and burthens of\nallaying them. He thought it was in the full power of these","61ef94bf7425adbd1d66c42c547f1aab.jpg"],[69812,"by proper exertion to cause the apprehension and delivery of the\nmurderers and other depredators who had been concerned in the\nlate rash, and lamentable outbreak upon their White Brethren of the\nCreek Nation; this exertion ought to be first required and demanded\nof them, after which if they turned a deaf ear and refused, and the\nGeneral called upon him, although the Horses belonging to his people\nwere much worsted by the fatigues of their late service and enter=\n\nprize, they would again nevertheless cheerfully turn out to his as\n=sistance and help to subdue and take them.\n(Reverting to the subject of their removal beyond the\nMississippi Hopoethla Yoholo said) Captain Walker one of the\nCompany of the contractors who had engaged with the Govern=\n=ment to emigrate them, had conversed some time back with\nhim about their emigration, and had offerd to open Camps for them\nto assemble in, upon condition, that they should only remain in\nCamp one week prior to the commencement of their journey, saying,\nthat he could not keep them in Camp and feed and furnish provi=\n=sions for them longer than that space: that his people would not\nagree to go into Camp upon such conditions, the time limited to them\nwas too short to make their needfull preparations in, therefore\nthey were unwilling to agree to it: lately Captn. Walker had again\nmade his people similar proposals, but as before, they could come\nto no understanding about it. On that occasion Coll. Hogan\nbeing absent they had obtained an interview with Captn. Page; at\nthis interview mention was made to him about the state of their\nLand matters which, although investigations had already been had\nabout them, it appeared by the order of the Government were to be\nhad over again: Captn. Page on that occasion had said to him\nthat there were so many Agents sent by the Government amongst\nthem to hold investigations about the stolen lands they made complaint\nof, and for other purposes, that he did not think it was going\nto do them any good: they would be kept by them untill fall before\ntheir business would be settled; that his people therefore had better\nsell their claims to these controverted lands for whatsoever they\nwere able, even though they might not be able to get the worth\nof them, they had best get something; something was better than no=\n\nthing. Then a man with whom at the time he was unac\n=quainted of middling height and rather thick came up and\naccosted him, saying, he had heard what had been said in the","6f16a7d526c4c682df6edf90d2c9f90d.jpg"],[69813,"matter of their land claims by Captn. Page, and if he liked the talk\nand would sell him the claims he would buy them, doubtfull\nas might be the chances of their recovery: nevertheless he said\nin the event of their selling to him, that he would incur the risk\nof this. Here Captn. Walker who was then present interfered\nand counsel'd his people to agree to this proposal and sell\ntheir claims as was desired, and it was at this period that he\nmade his second offer as last mention'd to open Camps for emi=\n=gration.\n(Being asked what Towns he thought were now willing\nto emigrate he replied) The Town of Tuck-a-batchee, for the most\npart, these were his people, they were in general willing except\nthose about Tuskehenehaw and under his influence, these\nobjected. The other Towns so far as he could learn were those\nof Au-to-see, Cle-wal-la, Tuskegee, Coosawda, Ki-a-\nli-gee, Hatchee-chub-ba, Au-tau-ga, To-war-sa, Part of\nU-fau-la on Tallapoosa, Hickory ground, Little Oak-choi,\nWe-wo-ka, Wockoy, Pok-en-tal-la-has-see, We-o-guf-ka,\nHil-la-bee, Part of Fish Pond, and part of Talla-dega.\nHopoethla Yoholo added in conclusion, that some of the\nCreeks had passed over among the Cherokees, they were composed\nprincipally of Sok-a-pa-toy, Kun-char-tee, Tallassee Hatchee,\nand a portion of Talladega.","4eb8127b7ccb1916cfac63a1d0bdae20.jpg"],[69814,"Substance of a Talk\nbetween\nGovernor C.

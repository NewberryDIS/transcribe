The Agency had for a long time been simply a sort of hospital for old infirm Indians, and commissary for Indian women and children, and safe refuge for [strike] and convenient place for the younger and more active Indians to obtain supplies to enable them to continue their raiding and depredations in Texas & elsewhere.

It was evident, however, that, he had made up his mind to avoid so far as possible, any serious trouble with the Agent or Indian [strike] Interior Department, even at the risk of adding a few more bad Indians to the force of Victorio, and possibly for the sake of peace, harmony and humanity, relied too much on the Agents ability or power to bring in & control the Indians and in a quiet way accomplish what would be difficult to effect by the use of force or the military directly, - without having the blow fall, perhaps too heavily, upon those who were comparatively innocent.\n\n    The weather was stormy and threatening, a severe gale prevailed during the 13th and 14th of April, and the Indians came in slowly, the time was extended a day at a time","eca35aa384788acc0152ac25bd723db6.jpg"],[66740,"until the 15th when a close count showed 320 Indians in all present at the Camps.

Indians were passing in & out and I call Gen. Hatch's attention to a party of Indians some mounted & others on foot, leading on driving horses & ponies up the mountain.  I recognized the Chief Nantzila as one of the number and asked permission to take or send out troops at once in pursuit.  Gen. Hatch thought that the troops had better not go, believing that the Chief was endeavoring to get his people in, & at that he would return with them.  Possibly this was the Chiefs intention but it was evident that he was not ?ching, as the Indians continued to ascend the Mountain.  Still greater commotion was soon observable in & about the Camps, and at about half past two. 30, minutes after the time specified or fixed upon, the signal shots were fired.  The Cavalry was then moved quickly across the Tularnda - Some going [2 words strike] beyond & around the Camps, & others [strike] up the side of the Mountains in pursuit of the fleeing Indians.

This neccesity may not occur again soon, as it was said to be the hardest winter experienced in this country for twenty five years.

These improvements made so far are intended to open up and irrigate ten thousand acres of new tillable lands, where no cultivation has heretofore been done.  At some of these places Indians have located and built houses of stone and logs with a view","f5e9e5bb5f5c9769b65db03a5a28b920.jpg"],[66786,"of permanent location, but from the want of plows, harness and other implements have done very little toward bringing these lands under cultivation thus far.\n\n    The total amount expended in labor and material in these improvements since commencement is ten thousand one hundred and fifty dollars much more work of this character could be well expended throughout the reservation.  Instead of prosecuting this work under the supervision of superintendents as heretofore, which has not been satisfactory, I think the best method would be by contract under bond for faithful performance.  Some of the dams constructed last year have washed out, in fact, it would be difficult to make a dam in this country to withstand the terrible floods during the rainy season, without a great outlay of expense: for this reason the construction of dams, except for temporary use, should be abandoned and the work directed to reservoirs ditches and the development of Springs.","84a4d276c0177a3fc5580c9a036f79c3.jpg"],[66787,"8.\nHouses.\nThe Indians are still possessed with a desire mentioned in my last annual report to build better houses of stone and logs, and to live more like Americans, with permanent homes.  Their demands continue to be incessant for lumber, doors, and windows, they themselves build the walls and do the work, this I consider an advanced step forward in the civilization of these people.  A saw mill provided by the last appropriation bill will be the means of supplying their demands in this respect, it will also answer the purpose of furnishing lumber for fencing their corn and wheat fields.\nAgricultural.\nThe additional farmers have not been able to render much service to the Indians mostly for the reason that there are very few plows and agricultural implements among the Navajos by which they could be properly instructed in modern and practical farming.","d935419315de984861f4e308b94e7ec2.jpg"],[66788,"9.\nThe farmer can give them no instruction in the use of the hoe, and without proper implements such as the plow and plow harness the position of a farmer is practically useless: from my observation and experience in planting corm here, the best method is to plow deep, sow the corn in the furrow and plow it under, then harrow the ground well and roll it.  The corn raised on the school garden this year was planted that way as an experiment and without irrigation was the best corn grown on the entire reserve, from this experience I am led to believe that very fair corn can be raised in many parts of the reservation without the use of water.  This system will be more fully listed next year.\n\n    By reason of the numerous patches of land that may be considered under cultivation ranging from a quarter to ten acres each, it is difficult to arrive at a correct estimate of the number of acres","3caa1a2e678d1175679218812993d034.jpg"],[66789,"10\ntilled, but I think it safe to say ten thousand.  The usual crops grown are corn and wheat, also pumpkins and melons to some extent, of these they raised this year.\nWheat, bu-                                   6 to 8000\nCorn,     \" in cob.                          65 \"  75000.\nPumpkins.                                    15 \" 20 000.\nMelons.                                         12 \" 15 000\nAbout one third of the corn is consumed when green for roasting ears, some of it they sell to traders, and grind the remainder into meal for their own use.  It would be a good thing if grinding mills, with horse power, be furnished them, at least there should be one established at the Agency.   The only place on the reservation where peaches grow, is in Canon De Shelly, where there are several orchards from one to three hundred trees each, these peaches are small and uncultivated, but yielding an annual average crop of one hundred and fifty to two hundred bushels, in the peach season it is not unusual to see","dc87b1f1bcf5fa03af062f38c647ce3d.jpg"],[66790,"11\ntwo to four thousand Indians at a time gathered at the orchards to eat peaches, making it a season of festivals and dances.\n\n    Non-reservation Indians.\n\nDuring the past two years many of the Indians residing out of their own country chiefly in New Mexico and Arizona have been induced by the advice of the Agent to return, but there is still from one fourth to one third of the tribe remaining permanently off the reservation, having doe so for the past twenty years or more.  Some of these have permanent locations near Springs and watering places with their herds, while others are congregated along  the railroad.  Early in July last under your direction I called a council of the Navajos for special Agent H. S. Welton for the purpose of laying the matter of restoring these Indians to their own country before them.  And to allow those of them who desire to remain permanently outside to","ce34b32570c124fe3e8b688325e2026e.jpg"],[66791,"12\ntake up houses under the severalty land act.  At this council there were present about two hundred chiefs and representative Indians.  Their proposition to the Special Agent was, that if the Government would give them land on the South side reaching to the railroad ten miles on the East side and ten to fifteen miles on the West to the little Colorado river, they would bring them upon the reservation.  This proposition I deem absurd and impracticable, with the present reservation limits there is sufficient territory to accomodate the entire tribe for years to come.  I am heartily in accord with the polity of the Indian office encouraging the Indians to take up land under the law who desire to remain out of the reservation.  The difficulty I see however growing out of this is that in the near future as settlements progress, white people may crown in upon them, cut off their ranges for pasture and compel them to abandon their homes.","c722749deb5eec63827cfee7d459138f.jpg"],[66792,"13.\nthis will evidently be the case so long as the Indians continue in the business of stock raising, as no considerable amount of stock could subsist on one hundred and sixty acres in this country.  The conflicts heretofore existing between whites and Indians along the borders have almost subsided during the past year.  I think both Indians and whites are learning the fact that peace is better than constant trouble.  Many complaints however are made to the Agent of Indians stealing and running off horses belonging to white ranch men.  In such cases the Agent always renders all aid that lies in his power to assist in the recovery of lost stock, but he finds in many instances where the Navajos are charged with stealing horses the animals have only strayed from the owner.  Very few Indians permanently reside over the San Juan river, the Northern boundary.  Although they sometimes make temporary raids to the annoyance of the ranch men in that section.  I am still of the opinion as often before stated, that it would be better looking to the promotion of peace and harmony","3f58be79295a208d9b90c11743a4abc3.jpg"],[66793,"14\nbetween the Indians and whites, and for the better government of the Indians themselves, if the Navajos were all confined within a certain boundary where the encroachments of the white settler would be entirely prohibited among them.\nNavajos on Moquis Reservation.\nFor many years a considerable number of Navajos reside upon what is known as the Moquis reservation, attached to this Agency.  The Moquis sometimes complain of depredations made upon their crops and stock.  There has been however fewer such troubles the past year than formerly.  These troubles are scarcely ever of a serious character and are always easily adjusted.  While there is not a very friendly feeling existing between the two tribes, they get along remarkably well together.\n\n    The efforts of the Agent have been constantly directed towards keeping the Navajos away from the Moquis farms and watering places.  Yet when the independent and roving character of the Navajo Indian is considered, it is no easy task for one man","d9be28bed4522d3e06ca0dfa2a0a08ae.jpg"],[66794,"15.\nto accomplish.  It would be better if the Navajos could be excluded entirely from the Moquii reserve, but that would be a more difficult problem even than the question of bringing the outside Indians upon the reservation.\nWhiskey Drinking.\nEvery summer there is more or less whiskey drinking among the Indians.  A little more this summer probably than last.  This may be accounted for by their being a greater number of white people engaged in the traffic in the growing towns along the railroad and other places.  This traffic I have determined to abate, to accomplish this I invoked the aid of a company of cavalry from Fort Wingate to be stationed at the Agency for thirty days to cooperate with the Indian police in the undertaking: for drinking I caused several Navajos to be locked up in the guard house as a punishment.  In August I sent the Chief of police with a detachment of police force","89eb1b33d72649e7805d21daf1c92e95.jpg"],[66795,"16.\nto arrest a man for selling whiskey to the Indians at the town of Gallop on the railroad and had him indicted for the offence, have also Indians testimony sufficient to convict two other men (Mexicans) residing on the East side, am glad to say now the whiskey traffic is completely wiped out among the Indians in all parts of the reservation, much credit is due to General Carr of Fort Wingate for his prompt cooperation with the Agent in this matter, and to C. E. Vandever Chief of police.\nCrimes and Punishments.\nVery few cases of crime or misdemeanor have occurred among the Indians requiring punishment.  I March last I investigated a case of killing between two Navajos named John, and Cabello Blanco.  I caused the guilty one John to be arrested and brought to the Agency on the hearing it was found that the act was clearly a case of self defense having","d9a79d8f1b7da6a40803b32e3f245f9e.jpg"],[66796,"17.\nbeen committed off the reservation, he was turned over to the civil authorities for trial.  About the eighth of June two Indians Pis-ca-luy-zr and Pis-ku-lu-zec respectively were apprehended under a charge of stealing twelve sheep from the Post butcher at Fort Wingate, N. M. these Indians after a preliminary hearing before a justice court at Gallup, N. M. were bound over to the District Court at Albuquerque and in default of bail were sent to the Albuquerque jail to await the action of the grand jury, September term.\n\n    In the month of June I received information that a white man engaged in peddling whiskey to the Indians had been murdered by two Navajos on the San Juan river in April last, I immediately dispatched the Chief of police with ten policemen to arrest the two Indians and bring them to the Agency, their friends had received notice of their coming and collected","e82080e1540d6e544c4cdc09961d59e9.jpg"],[66797,"18.\nin a body of one hundred or more to resist the arrest.  Under the circumstances force was not resorted to, the party returned, referring the facts to the Agent.  A council of the chiefs and head men were called at which a demand was made upon them to bring in the two murderers within a reasonable time.  Up to this date they have failed to do so.  I thought it best to exhaust all peaceable means to secure the guilty Indians before resorting to military force, and still have hopes that they may be so induced to give themselves up.  Had it not been for the encouragement they and their friends had received from certain white persons by telling them they did a good thing to kill a whiskey peddler, and they should not be punished therefor, there would have been no obstacles in the way of their apprehension.  While it might be said that the deceased received his just deserts for pursuing the unlawful business of dealing out whiskey","3cf425b6669bfb5e586f12521efb7adf.jpg"],[66798,"19.\nto Indians on the reservation.  Yet it will not do to let such acts pass without a hearing to determine the innocence or guilt of the accused parties, to teach them obedience to the laws.  These embrace all the acts of criminal character occurring during the year.\nConduct.\nThe conduct of the Indians during the past year is uniformly good.  they are usually busy attending their herds, flocks and crops.  The habits of industry is becoming more fixed among them.  Their desire to accumulate wealth is fully equal to that of the white race;  they have natural business habits, and are generally inclined to settle their disputes on business principles, they like to council with the Agent on matters pertaining to their individual and general welfare.  Scarcely a day passes without one or more coming in, oft time from a great distance, to see the Agent concerning something of interest","b4148894ce7336ab09cb848926c7f43b.jpg"],[66799,"20\nto them.  Generally when disputes arise over the property of a deceased relative, the distribution thereof is left to the Agent for settlement, which is usually final as of an appeal to a court of last resort under civil procedure.  it is gratifying to note the peaceful and prosperous condition of this great tribe.\nThe San Juan Settlers.\nIn obedience to your instructions the white settlers located on parts of sections 14-15 and 16- on the San Juan river within the reservation were by the assistance of a company of troops in September last ejected by force from the disputed lands.  Under authority a special police force of six Indians stationed on the vacated premises from December to June, had the effect of preventing a return of the settlers.  I am no pleased to say that the troubles leading at times to the verge of serious and bloody conflicts for nearly two years between the settlers and Indians are at an end,","41cb995135837eb5c13a18e342367971.jpg"],[66800,"21.\nand peace and good order prevails in that section.  Thanks is due to General R. H. Grierson and Lieut. Scott for prompt and efficient cooperation in the removal of the settlers and maintaining the peace.\nImprovement at Agency.\nThe improvements on Agency buildings and repairs commenced the year previous were completed June 30th last.\n\n    The employes quarters consists of four buildings 20 x 50 feet of three to four rooms each, two of them with the dispensary building of same size have been completely overhauled.  New shingle roofs have taken the place of the low flat ones of logs and dirt, the old adobe walls repaired and strenghtened, new ceilings, flooring, doors, windows and painting.  The police and visiting chiefs quarters have been made more comfortable and respectable by new floors, ceilings and other repairs, these buildings with their white fronts give the","d9fb30dd378fdb2d9b4ca802d4debfb7.jpg"],[66801,"22\nAgency a neat cheerful and improved appearance, greatly in contrast with it former condition.  new out houses were also erected and repaired, the whole at a cost of labor and material of $2,600.00 in addition to labor performed thereon by the regular employes.\nWater.\nAn abundant supply of pure water was had at the Agency during the summer, a current runs continually round three sides of the plaza, besides feeding an artificial lake of ten acres in extent at the Agency, this lake has recently been enlarged and the banks made higher by the Agency employes and teams, so as to give a uniform depth of three to four feet.  The lake will accomodate all Indian Stock adjacent to the Agency, besides that needed for irrigation and rice.\nEmbarrassments.\nSince the commencement of my administration I have been placed to a disadvantage","4a93e611bc7c85e651d6f5a0a381156a.jpg"],[66802,"23.\ncompared with the means at hand and resources of my predecessor Mr Bowman.  He was provided with large quantities of annual supplies for issue, such as wagons, harness, plows, hoes, axes, scrapers, wheelbarrows, cook stoves, overcoats, boots, tools &c, placing something in the hands of nearly every family, while I have had but a handful of small things to give, reaching to the benefit of a few persons only.  In this there has been much discontent and grumbling, putting the Agent upon the defensive to explain as against the accusations that he is not as liberal as former Agents were, and they think for this he is personally to blame, not capable of understanding the cause of limited appropriations are inclined to blame the Agent personally.\nMy Authorized Assistants.\nWhites.\nPhysician                                                         $1200.00 per annum\nClerk                                                                       \"                \"\nBlacksmith and Carpenter (one man)                 $900.00          \"","6fbf56e671f5199374fb4fc643084cca.jpg"],[66804,"25\nLeaving me with six white assistants to Mr Bowmans eight, and two Indian laborers to his four, a carpenter, and an Agency farmer, for all work, in addition to the employes allowed are indispensable to a proper management of this vast Agency, and giving the Agent more time to get over the reservation.\nOwing to the limited force a great portion of the additional farmers time was brought into requisition to perform general work, when the pay of employes, medical stores and forage for three teams are taken out of the annual allowance of $7,500-very little is left for the Indians.  To repeat the language of my last report. \"Economy is a good thing when properly applied, but the purse strings may be so tightly drawn as to work an absolute injury to the accomplishment of an object sought to be obtained.\"\n\n    Liberal aid extended towards the improvement of an uncivilized people","08ed524d5c0b9ee6f059c277ee1a11a7.jpg"],[66805,"26\nwho have inclinations to advance their condition should not be overlooked by a generous government.\nEmployes.\nThe conduct of the employes with a few exceptions during a part of the year was not entirely satisfactory.  Frequently an unaccountable jealousy, or ill humor, exists between the Agency and school people.  In the latter part of the winter and early spring a bitter felling was engendered between the two divisions growing out of gross misconduct on the part of the Superintendent and other school employes, which for a time disturbed the equilibrium of the Agency, the troublous element was removed giving way to harmony and good order.\n\n   As a general rule employes do not exercise that care and interest in Agency affairs that should be expected of them.  A careless disregard of the care of property for which the Agent is","9658c38f40487ab18e720f711e4cc993.jpg"],[66806,"27\nresponsible on his bond, is often noticed requiring the utmost diligence on the Agents part to prevent shortages in his account.  This should not be, an Agent should be surrounded by a corps of personal friends who would take as much interest in the management as the Agent himself.  I believe the rule of allowing Agents to select and nominate, will work a reform in this respect.\nSchool.\nAfter the hard and incessant work of 1887 in bringing the school up to a higher standing ever reached.  I looked forward to the accomplishment of greater results during the fiscal year last part, but was doomed to meet disappointment.  Instead of an average attendance of 43 in 1887, the 30th of June 1888, closed with an average during the year of 35.   This falling off was attributed mainly to a loss of interest on the part of the Superintendent and Matron which","252d9360ed95f040aad8e00f7e0db3cf.jpg"],[66807,"28\ncharactized their conduct the previous year, together with an exibition of disgraceful behavior fully reported to your office and not necessary to be detailed here.  This brought the school into a state of confusion and disorder.  The superintendent left on the 26th of January.  Additional farmer Jenkins acted as superintendent until the end of February, during March the Agent assumed control.  On April 2nd the Matron left, on the 4th the industrial teacher resigned, and the teacher relieved by transfer, on the 9th of the same month, additional farmer Foster and the seamstress Miss Saulbec, acting as superintendent and Matron respectively from April 1st to 19th.  When the new superintendent and matron Mr Mooney and wife took charge.\nMr Cookerly's place was filled on may 27th by W. F.

If you could only spend the time of Pa's absense here, she would enjoy it so very well. E. say they will make some arrangement for Cynthia. She can stay at Mr. Oliver Butler's or they will make some other arrangement for her.

Fear you are thinking altogether too much of others and too little of yourself, as you always do. Wish you could have a better\nchance to rest. If you could be here while father is gone I should be glad. Hope Father will have a good pleasant time. You ought to try to rest while he is gone. I have enjoyed having the girls with me. Am sorry Mary's health is no better. Hope she will yet find that it has been a benefit to her. We have some anxiety about her going home alone. Hope she will be stronger in two or three weeks and then she will be likely to have no difficulty. We are all in normal health. The children are enjoying the pleasant weather very much. Wish we could all come out and see you this Summer. Perhaps we may another year if spared. I want to see you. Fear you are wearing yourself out too fast. We had a letter from Sarah Sharis? last week. They were well but very busy. Nothing special in the letter. Also about the same time from Anna.

Father will be going next week and I shall thus lose seeing him before he starts. It cost me quite a struggle to bring my mind to this, but perhaps it is best so. I do not think my heath is quite as good as when we came out, but hope after getting home and resting that I may realize that the visit has been beneficial.","b1e70e9ca77bed713ce968dc64249cdb.jpg"]],"transcount":15,"percentTranscribed":7.000000000000001,"date":[1850,1891],"category":"Family papers; Letters (Correspondence); Women","title":"Mary Holywell Everett letters, 1850-1891"}}}

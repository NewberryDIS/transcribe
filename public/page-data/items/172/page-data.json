May 2nd 1864\nMy dear good wife\n\n     I wrote you quite a long letter yesterday which went out in this morning mail.  I will write you a few words to-night.  You say you like to get letters from me often I am very glad you do for I like to write you often.  I enjoy writing you but I should not did I not think you enjoyed my letters.  I enjoy getting letters from you O so much.  You cannot get time to write me as often as I can you.  You have the children to look after which of course takes up much of your time & then you are visiting & of course much of your time is necessarily occupied socially.  I take all those things into consideration & thank you a thousand times for the frequent letters I get from you.  I believe you enjoy writing to me & do write me as often as it is possible.  I also believe you love","1a23fc4940689509ea075a726a8d775b.jpg"],[40082,"me & prefer living with me even on our farm to living without me in New England, consequently I am anxious to have you with me, & shall do all in my power to make you happy.  If I contribute to your happiness in any way by word or act I do hope you will always tell me of it for I do like to know when I please you & I like to feel that my efforts are appreciated.  It adds to my happiness to know that I am adding to yours.  A word of encouragement & approved from you does more for me & adds more to my happiness than you are aware of & on the contrary if that word is withheld it detracts more from my happiness than I think you are aware.  Then, dear wife, may I not ask you not only to love me but to often tell me of your love & to aid me in my efforts by words of encouragement approval & affection.  I promise you such aid, sich encouragements, approval & affection shall be reciprocated.","414e4b06dc2765494cc7471680b60312.jpg"],[40083,"I will try & pay you for them with compound interest.  I know I have my duties to you as my wife, to love you, to be kind & affectionate to you & to lighten your trials by words & acts of sympathy, encouragement & appreciation, & I will try & act the part of a true husband better in the future than I ever have done in the past.  I want to have you with me very much for I think we both look upon ou situation in the same light & shall do all in our power to mutually aid each other in being contented & happy in our lot.  If we do our home will be a happy one, & when an opportunity presents itself to better our home we shall both gladly & thankfully accept it.  My feeling thus we can freely counsel together in regard to all our affairs.  What says my dear wife, I wish you would be sure & write me upon this subject --- Since writing the above I have made a short call at Mr. Paine's.  Mr & Mrs. Pain were both","120deaa92db1121f18207f377c52305e.jpg"],[40084,"at home. They are well & so are their children.  They enquired kindly for you.  Madam Paine & Katie are still East.  I think a great deal about your journey home.  It will be very hard for you at best.  I wish I felt able to go East & return with you but I am afraid to.  I am aware you do not think I should run any risk, or of course you would not wish me to do so, for of course you are as anxious to have me live as I am to live & would regard my death as a great calamity to you & the children.  My experience the last time I went East & also my recent experience in riding in the cars makes me dread a journey very much.  Perhaps my fears are groundless.  I fear also that it will do you harm.  Perhaps you can arrange so as to stop at Albany with Mrs. Lee & at Buffalo with Mr. Hartzell's folks in case Lydia returns with you & then by taking the sleeping car from Buffalo you will not get as tired.  If I go with you I shall not think of going through without stopping.  I wish you & I were both well but we are not.  You will get so tired coming out.  David said to-day he would pay 10 dollars towards my expenses East if I would stop in N.Y. City and see some men there for him.  I would not hesitate a moment to go East & return with you did I not so dread the effect of the journey.  For I do want to see Sarah & George in their home & sister Lydia & then I know it would be easier for you even if Lydia did return with you.  I may yet overcome my fears enough to make the attempt.  Mr. Paine said if he was in my place he should not dare undertake it.  It did not rain last night as i wrote you I fear it would.  It has been quite cold to day & is to-night.  I should enjoy so much to have you with me to night to snug close up to me & to give me some of your sweet kisses.  I am daily expecting to hear whether Lydia will return with you & if not then I must make such other arrangements as well best suit you.  I hope I shall find a letter in the P.O. from you in the morning. With a loving kiss I bid you a sweet good night, affectionately\nN. Kendall","411246618d908be397c054bc30f3f1d9.jpg"],[40085,"La Porte Ind May 3rd 1864\nMy dear good wife,\n\n     It is a very pleasant night & not as cold as it was yesterday.  There is a great excitement here in war matters.  The governors of the Central West have offered the president 100,000 men for 100 days to man the fortifications & so let the old veterans go forward & take part in the approaching gigantic struggle.  The West has done nobly in this war.  Illinois is a long way in advance in men of all calls made upon her & so is Indiana & yet there is an instantaneous rally & response to this new call.  I feel proud of the West.  Were I able I presume I should have been in the army long ago.  Our family have however furnished its quota.  War is a terrible thing.  I shrink from its scenes of carnage & its demoralizing influence & yet it seem to be","08d0695d1ff54818bde77e70cbd65b6a.jpg"],[40086,"often the only way of safety.  He who would calmly sit down & see his wife & children abused, insulted & slain without using every effort in his power to protest & defend them is a cowardly wretch that deserves neither home or wife or children.  So he who can calmly & suprisely see his country destroyed by the hands of traitors & yet make no effort for its safety is not deserving of a country.  I tremble when I look at the approaching struggle & think of the effects of a defeat of our arms.  I think the move being made by the governors of the West is a wise move, for then new men will enable as many veterans to go forward from the fortifications & take part in the struggle & in case of disaster they will serve as a nucleus around which to rally our shattered hosts.  What tremendous","9148adeb69c4371ad20124e9a2e9db10.jpg"],[40087,"armies stand now opposing each other in Virginia & near Chattanooga I have great confidence in Genl Grant but still I cannot help but feel anxious, for the rebels have massed tremendous armies to oppose him on his way to Richmond, as well as to oppose the advance from Chattanooga.  At these two points the armies of the North & South are being massed for a desperate struggle & I am expecting daily to hear of such battles as this ever has not yet seen.  What a terrible affair in the massacre at Ft. Pillow was.  Mr. Leamings brother is the only officer that can survive.  He was shot down after the surrender as the others were but it is thought he will recover.  After he had surrendered a rebel took deliberate aim at him & shot him","c59a4786fd763434cc500c3a11a0a519.jpg"],[40088,"The ball entered his side & has not yet been extracted.  He says the man who shot him was not over 20 feet from him.  After he was shot he fell down the embankment some 20 feet & there laid unable to move & while lying there rebel men unarmed & who had surrendered & frequently the brains of their victims would be spattered over him & the only way he could get rid of the sight was to shut his eyes.  The fort was garrisoned by Negro troops.  It was attacked by overwhelming forces.  The Negro troops you know have white officers.  After the fort surrendered every officer was shot in cold blood & the negros murdered.  It is strange that such barbarities should have been committed in our own country which we are want to look upon as a civilized land.  Leaming brother has been brought home on a cot in the cars.  Do you get excited over these things down there in Mass.  There is a large war meeting here to-night.  I called at Mr. Hannah's this evening & Mrs. Hannah & Mrs. Bennet were both at the war meeting.  You know I do not go into any large assemblies as it is difficult for me to breath.  I hardly know where to direct this letter to you.  I think I will direct to Warwick & if you are not there they will course forward it.  I am very anxious to have you & the children with me & look forward to your return with pleasant anticipations.  Kiss the children for me & remember me kindly to al.  With a loving kiss I bid you a sweet good night.  Affectionately your husband.\nN.

It has been a beautiful day & quite warm & is a beautiful night.  I am not feeling well to-night I am very tired, oh, so tired.  I don't like these tired feelings but I suppose I must expect them during the approaching warm weather.  I do long to get into the country with you & our children once more.  I hope I shall be better there.  If we spend the aniversary of our marriage together we shall soon meet for it is only 20 days off.  I hope I shall get a letter from you in the morning that i may know where you are & how your health is as well as that of the children","b5e22cc846700b72707f6d50e880207d.jpg"],[40092,"I suppose you spent most of last week with Emily.  I am anxious to know how our little boy gets along now he has to give up his natural food.  I saw Charles to-night.  He and Ellen have got to housekeeping but he said he had a bad night last night as his breathing troubled him much in his new home.  If he only gets into business I think he will get along nicely & enjoy life much better than he did before he was married.   I am thinking that you are at Lawrence, &  I wonder have you got along on your journey to Lawrence, & how you are enjoying yourself & how the children like.  If you are there remember me kindly to all & tell them it would be a great pleasure to me to visit them.  I will bid you good night & write you more in the morning.  \nMay 5th Evening\nDear wife I did not get a letter from","f8421ca71e834d3c4262b3ad40242f8f.jpg"],[40093,"you this morning as I hoped.  It has been a very warm day.  I am better than I was yesterday.  I am waiting to hear from you so as to know where to send this letter, & also I want to hear from you before I go down to the farm as I want to know what arrangements to make when I get down there.  I called on Charles & Ellen to day.  They seem very cozy in their new home & happy.  Their house is fixed up with much taste.  I have taken a long walk this evening.  I hope I shall get a letter from you soon.  With much love I bid you good night again.\nMay 7th - I received your letter mailed last Tuesday this morning.  I was glad enough to hear from you.  You were then in Warwick but I suppose you will be in Lawrence before this letter can reach you hand I shall direct to Lawrence.

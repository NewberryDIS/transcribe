Hatch, myself the Indian Agent, interpreters and some other officers went through the camps to count the Indians. At first we concluded that there were about 200 but when they were gotten into one line squatting upon the ground, a careful count resulted in bringing the number up to 300 and before night about 50 more came in.

The issue of rations will be made under the supervision of an Officer of the Army.\nTwo years ago the Indians were estimated at over 2000 & one year ago last month, when the present Agent took charge, the number was reduced to less than 1400. From that the number issued to have been gradually reduced to about 800 and hereafter it will not be over 400. It has heretofore","808161785abdc1e70197c56bc0db6c02.jpg"],[65216,"been impossible for the Indian Agent to tell to know how many Indians there really were at the Agency. As the Indians were scattered about in camps from 5 to 40 miles distant from the Agency building and as issues were made but once a week, he very rarely or ever saw only a few Indians who came in for rations. The rations were generally drawn by the Squaws. Each band or party sending in sometimes and old Indian and a few Squaws with pack mules and ponies? for rations & often one Squaw would draw the rations.

The Agent was powerless to make the Indians come in & the Agency being placed in a mountainous country, the Indians could go & come when & where they pleased and were constantly roaming over the country into Texas and elsewhere, stealing horses and committing other depredations while the few who remained about the Agency were drawing rations as if all were near at hand. Hundreds of people have been making their living by buying rations and stolen horses & other stolen property of the Indians. The Indians are not the only thieves.

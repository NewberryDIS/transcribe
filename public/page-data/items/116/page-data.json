We are glad she is not so poorly as she was last Fall, and we sincerely hope that she will be spared such a time as that, and may soon feel like her self again.\n        It is a good Providence that has sent Cousin Jennie to you. She has been on hand just at the right point so many times. Give our love to her.\n         We did not realize that Aunt Jane was hurt so badly. It is ver fortunate that she has been getting along so nicely. Is Clara at home this Summer. We should be glad to hear from her.\n    We are still at Osawatomie. Father has not tried as yet to build. A week ago Sunday","a83362c834636de45e69bd285f776c75.jpg"],[28288,"I spent at Oneida, in Nemeha County, in the Northern part of the state about a hundred and seventy miles from here. I had a very pleasant time, finding the church in a small town the size of Remsen or, smaller, and sustained by a well-to-do and hospitable farming community.\n\n        Last Sunday I spent at Wichita. There are two of our churches there, -one a thrifty one, - the other in rather a precarious a condition. It is the latter which I was sent to inspect. There are some very promising features about it however, It is in a way connected with a new","35eaca7f889259e4d7b858ce28b0bad8.jpg"],[28289,"Congregational school, which is just opening as a College.

Fairmount is the locality A street car line connects the settlement with the main part of the city.\n\n    Baby is still troubled with his bowels, but he is better than he was. Ella is not at all strong. She is really feeble but we are all the time hoping she","f82017697aafd95ddbf90eb0c04a1c51.jpg"],[28290,"will be better. Howard & Zaider are well. Father is pretty strong. He goes to the farm every day. He does not try to do much and yet he has a good deal of endurance.\n\n    Father has no bible and would like one. There are two or three which he would like,-one a Bible, one a book of Psalms,- one a Greek Testament. I thought you might be willing to let your yearly interest in the Bible society go towards getting these for him. The amount comes to three dollars and","939282c386b37b9d0c99a6ebac7aadee.jpg"],[28291,"sixty cents. I have added an item to the list, namely a Welsh & English Testament to make it up to four dollars (actually it amounts to $3.95) If you care to do this will you sign the orders enclosed in the enclosed envelope and mail. If you have already called for all you are entitled to for this year, or wish to use it some other way we will order less for Father. In that case let me know so that I may act accordingly.\n\n    Robert's people are well. Mary and her mother Lewis & Olive","639f25e6b625f72aae1ff314f556b637.jpg"],[28292,"have called at different times lately, and we see Robert quite frequently. He looks very natural.\n\n    Ella wants me to ask whether we are settled over a church soon and Aunt Mary gets strong enough to travel you will not come and live near us again or if you do not want to move, whether you will not come and spend the winter with us. We want to have you near again. If it should happen that we should go to Wichita I may say that rents are very reasonable there.","5369629100e43e48985380ea9307e6c3.jpg"],[28293,"- five dollars a month gets a nice large house on Fairmount.\n\n     We wish very much we might see you. We shall look for word from you again soon, and we trust it may be convenient for you to write often while Aunt Mary is poorly. How is Cousin Jennie. I hope she is well and strong. Is Cousin Josephine well again? \n     Did you receive the photographs we sent. We do not think much of those of ours.

It is one of the Gilson houses. Perhaps Aunt Mary may remember about them. We are but a very short distance from the Congregational Church.\n         With love-\n         J. E. & E.

These must have been a hundred dollars worth of value in the box.  It was from the Broadway Tabernacle in New York.  Lately, we have learned that the Broadway Tabernacle is famous for sending out good rich boxes.  Perhaps we are over sensitive in feeling as we do about these boxes, but we have kept the matter to ourselves.  Our first books we got two years ago].  We got the third a few weeks ago.  If Ellen should go to Philadelphia, would it be too great a care for you to have Zaidee and Robert with you for a while.

We judge that you are both better than usual, from your letters.  Isn't this winter pretty severe for you?  New York seems to have suffered from such hard times that the papers have told of them and we have heard of them in that way.  Then perhaps you have had many storms that we have heard nothing about.  We have been free from bad weather.  In November we had quite a cold snap, and during the last week or more, we have had a little snow and rather cold winds.  But yesterday it was warm again and","d12a5d0975afcf3017e1113ab232fc6b.jpg"],[28298,"it is also mild today.  The last week's storm was very severe we see in some parts of Kansas, and farther south, there having been a cyclone  I believe in Louisiana.  We are about as usual.  All pretty well except Ella.  As far as we can see she is not gaining.  But perhaps she is, nevertheless.  Dr Robinson thought she would be several months an invalid.  Our cow is a comfort to us.  We have all the milk we want to drink and have not had to buy any butter either since getting  her.  We are also selling a quart of milk a day now and sometimes two quarts.

It is very painful to us here to learn of Aunt Mary's sickness as it is of the sickness of either of you because our distance from you makes it impossible for us to think of going back and forth unless called by absolute necessity.  We hope very much that Aunt Mary will be better very soon and that the doctor will not be called in again.  I am afraid you are both quite poorly a good deal of the time.  I feel almost guilty- in being so far away from you.  We wouldn't have left Michigan except we had been, as it seemed to us, almost compelled to come.  Father's accident and resulting ill health and homelessness would have made it necessary for me to have been with him for a long number of weeks last summer.  Then I would have had to return to Mich. and look up a church, and In the meantime Ella and the family would have","948ebc5fee1bc144694d1d01bafe1fe7.jpg"],[28301,"been at expense with nothing coming in.  Then again the baby was such an overpowering burden at that time that it did not seem best for me to leave Ella with him.  All things taken together it seemed to us that we had no other way before us than to move to Kansas. When we think of you both being there so far away from us and in feeble health, we have more than once spoken as though our increasing the distance between us was not apparently just right: but on the other hand, we believe that we could not easily have done otherwise.  We shall think of you very often now, hoping that you may have it easier soon.  We have not heard from Cousin M A Roberts since she went to California.  We have not her address and have not written her, though I have intended to do so, addressing her at Chicago, knowing the letter would be forwarded.  Ella does not get any better.  She grows weaker, I believe.  We will do something before long to try to help her.  We have just got a horse and are going to try to have her ride a good deal.  We have sent fop the buggy which is still at Osawatomie.  We may drive through to Osawatomie after awhile to see whether the open air and riding will be beneficial.We shall be anxious to hear again.

We are still on the farm and must remain for a little time.  We cannot leave while the cattle are here to be attended to.  It seems that they will need to be disposed of and we think there will be no need of keeping them any longer than necessary.  I do not know whither the sale will bring more now than later in the fall or less.  The unclear are not very definite as far as I can learn, and as there is no kind of assurance that anything will be gained by waiting, we do not think it wise to arrange to stay here longer than we are obliged to.

Horace Barnard and others also sat up.  He and Robert were there when I arrived.  Horace returned in the evening and though he did not intend staying, as there were two others who were here to sit up, he continued here till quite late, and then thinking that father was worse or likely to be, he stayed right on.  About midnight, Father became decidedly worse, and it was soon evidence that he was dying.  He passed away around 17 minutes before one.  We very soon called one of the men and he drove me to town to telegraph to Ella I thought possibly the telegraph would be delivered immediately, and that she would in that way have time to get ready to start that day and reach here Sunday morning as the men thought at first that the funeral ought to be held Sunday, But we decided afterwards that it would be","a59d7cee6ac8a6a24584a7e0974f9340.jpg"],[28304,"as well to have it Monday.  However, Ella got there Sunday morning about daylight Uncle Edward came on the same train I had telegraphed him at the same time.  We held the funeral services at the house.  The unclear were Mr. Stanley, Elias Snyder, Mr. Patterson, Will unclear, Peter Reynolds, and John Lessender Henry Stanley was a great help to us as he is himself an undertaker having just returned to the farm recently, There is not much to say about Father's sickness more than I have already said.  Sunday the 2nd he helped with the work milking as usual in the evening.  One of the hands was to leave that night.  Father told him he might return the next morning, saying that he was not well and felt as through he might be going to have a spell of sickness.  The next morning he told one of the boys to get the breakfast, as he was not able to be around.  That day he was up and down and in a kind of","e1b953ce8f0a1eece2fdca8ccaec5280.jpg"],[28305,"stupor much of the time.  Tuesday he was some better.  Wednesday he was quite a little worse.  Thursday he was better again, and conversed some.  Friday morning he talked some to one or two callers.  Robert wrote to me Wednesday, the letter reached me Thursday noon.  The returning train started out at five minutes before one so I could not make it.  So I booked the Santa Fe going out at 4.43. unclear and reached here about twenty four hours later.  The doctor thinks the unclear was more than Father could endure, and that it was the cause of his sickness.  He had been working hard during the summer, and had lately been somewhat worried it appears by the hands, who were not inclined to unclear unclear work.  Heart=failure, the Doctor says, was the immediate cause of his death.  Dr Hayes had charge.  Monday unclear  It is raining this morning.  I have been","f687cbb7b59d5a634e3b1f4ad9047ba9.jpg"],[28306,"helping with the chores, and it has got to be nearly noon.  Andy, the man, is separating the milk, which takes about an hour, more or less.  The little house is quite comfortable- an immense improvement unclear the old cabin.  There are two rooms below and one above, which however could be made into two.  We occupy the loft for a bedroom, and Andy and another man when there is one sleeps on the floor downstairs Tomorrow I presume I shall see about bills for the sale.  We will give nine months tenure on sums over five dollars.  I believe that is customary.  At all events, I am not permitted to give longer time than that.  There are some things that were given to Father by you, and by Cousin M.A.R. and a few by us that will not be up up for sale.  We want you to write us what to do with the things you gave him.

Ella has been home now for a week.  We cannot tell whether she is going to get well under her present treatment or not.  Dr. Robinson thinks she will after some months.  The most alarming trouble is the sore in the neighborhood of her right ovary.  She has felt that since before the baby was born.  Dr Robinson says it is in the large intestine.  He thinks that the action of the intestine was impeded until at one unclear it became enlarged so as to form a kind of sack, and that it has in that way grown sore.  If that could be believed, our alarm would be greatly lessened.  But no relief has as yet come to that.  Otherwise she is better, though she is weak,","4e4c41511b5fe8dcf32807e8b167a786.jpg"],[28309,"and unable to sit up long at a time some days.

We had intended getting one this fall, but had finally decided we would have to give up the idea, on account of the expense.  But we had a chance to get a good cow for twenty dollars.

I hope we may now because a stable was recently built on our lot.  We think they have been going to lay.  We had a present of a hog, butchered last week.  It was from Dr. Cloud, whose wife's funeral I conducted a few weeks ago.  Mrs. unclear came and helped cut it up, and made sausage for us.

It was a pretty cold time for you Aunt Anna to have a severe cold, but it is very fortunate that you got better so soon.  Thirty-one degrees below zero is fearfully cold, even for unclear.

You can count on the severe weather being about half over now. We hardly mind the winters here. Indeed they are far more enjoyable than the summers.

Roberts is hardly critical enough as yet to understand the merit of Aunt Mary's poetry but if we can keep it for him, he may be some day. Ella writes hopefully from Chicago. She is given a colonic flushing every day, and she thinks her bowels are beginning to act. the Doctor says that that treatment is bound to bring them to act, so she wrote in her last received today. She seems to be taking very little medicine. All","af4aee7380e627a1ec65d1ae7bbea596.jpg"],[28319,"that she takes as I believe is Cascara pills. These are supposed to be strenghening to the bowels. She thinks that she will not have to undergo an operation. Her liver does not work just right, it seems, but her lungs and heart are sound. She has some bronchitis. She has not said anything about her stomach except that at the first examination a stomach pump was applied, and no undigested food was discovered. She has not said much about the pain in her side, except that it still troubles her. I think they consider it as Dr Robinson in Manhattan did, a distention of the large intestine at one point, which causes a kind of sack to be formed, but I am not sure that they have really committed themselves in regard to that trouble. Two doctors attend Ella - a greater","9bb5ec6ea0448869a6f8d2863e20abc0.jpg"],[28320,"and a lesser light. The former's name is Robinson, who comes two or three times a week.

She went the 20th of January reaching there the 21st and taking her first treatment the 22nd. The expense is 11.20 a week, which is 20% off, the discount being to minister's family. That includes room, board, and dressing. The Medical attention is besides that. We do not know what that will be. We will be able to meet the expense. We were ahead a very little at the end of our year here, which helped towards the Manhattan expense, which all told was about a hundred dollars - a half of which we had in the bank to begin with. To start on the","dfa370eb7c1686ffecc18093d814e44d.jpg"],[28321,"present trip.

I had designedly left something there in case some demand might arise that I did not for see. It proved that the demand was my own. then the church is owing us 30 besides 20 paid today, and the H. M. Society is indebted $25 to us. Then if Ella has to remain long, she will have some interest that she can use in April, and by that time, our field will have netted us something again over and above our necessary home expenses.

It was doubtless membranous croup, and not contagious, though Dr Drummington? regarded it contagious. Aunt Mary's letters received today. Hope to hear again soon\nWith love\nJ.E.

Wednesday last we became fearful that he might be in a critical condition. We called Dr. Cloud, who has been with us for the most part in sickness since we have been here. So far the favorable indications are pretty evenly balanced against the unfavorable. I have just telegraphed Dr. Drummington of Hazelton, a neighboring town, asking him to come for consultation. We hope there may be a favorable turn soon.

EVERETT, Pastor.\nKiowa, Kansas Jan 16 1899\nMy Dear Aunts: -\nWe have a favorable report of Roberts this morning, but we are still very anxious about him. Dr. Drummington came yesterday afternoon. He pronounced the disease diphtheria. Dr Cloud, however, calls it croup. However, both decided that Roberts would probably not live through the night. If he should they thought he might probably recover, He passed a better night than we feared he would. It is now past ten oclock, am, and he has rested nicely since about daylight, though without sleeping. But he slept nearly all night. Yesterday nearly all day he breathed very hard, and last night till about two-thirty. Today he breathes naturally. We are now hopeful, though we fear another night. We were greatly favored in having two ladies to watch with us last night who were very competent and helpful. We feel very thankful that our little boy is with us this morning. To be sure we presume he is in a very perilous condition yet, but have great hopes that he will recover. He would not take medicine last night, and part of it had to be forced into his mouth. Two doses were made to enter by stratagem. But through all his suffering he has been very","451c5fb17eaae18072f9755df3d1d16b.jpg"],[28395,"uncomplaining. Last night he said two or three times, \"I can't hardly stand it.\" But he has been very patient all the time.\nFriends are extremely kind, doing all that can be done. School is dismissed for today and tomorrow, and perhaps longer.\nA little girl died last week of the same trouble, and I believe one or two other cases are reported. I will try to write again tomorrow\nWith Love\nJ.E. Everett.\nP.S. I enclose a letter he wrote to his Aunties a few days ago, Zaidee guiding his hand. It was worded just as he wanted it. He was half-sick and exacting, and wanted it written as he said. -\nI am afraid we never acknowledged the Xmas gifts from you. They were very nice indeed, and greatly appreciated. The little fellow is very choice of his spoon, and Margaret will think a great deal of her cup I am sure when she gets old enough to understand about it.

He has had an extremely sick time, but he had in his favor good health to begin with, and I think, a strong constitution. Sunday Dr Cloud called about two o'clock P.M. and thought his little patient dying. He administered very strong medicine, sulphate of mercury, which produced vomiting, and gave relief. The same remedy was given during the night. Yesterday afternoon we were alarmed by his breathing becoming labored again. We were alone, and had to administer medicine forcibly, which was a task almost too severe for our nerves. But we accomplished it and with good results. Last night he gave us little uneasiness. He had one very severe paroxysm of coughing and unclear. We now have good hopes of his recovery.\nIf school reopens tomorrow, I may not write. If not I shall try to.\nWith Love -\nJ.E.

The manager told me that the New York State Education","df482d7521651e0c7ab8f2317f6f2306.jpg"],[28468,"Department keeps a list of approved colleges whose diplomas are accepted and she felt sure that the University of Minnesota is on the list but did not know about Washburn College.

I wish they might come to Syracuse but it is very difficult to get in here. Even those with the very best qualifications must have two years successful experience before teaching in Central. I should never have been accepted if I had not taught under our principal Mr. Alverson in Gourverneur. I am enclosing the address of the agency giving me the information but there are several others in this city just as good. The Fiske Agency has an office here conducted by Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller, acquaintances","f9da2c4d9482c1000c83ca1d5ffd7fa9.jpg"],[28469,"of mine. Of course Margaret will need testimonials from the places in which she has taught or permission to use names as references. it is quite probable that they may find it advisable to accept positions in smaller towns at first and work into what they want later.\nI am sorry that I have no photograph of myself at present but if you really want one I shall be glad to have the Gouverneur photographer finish one from my last negative taken in 1921.\nYou will notice my address is changed.

How did you find the Baby this time Mother? Has anything of moment or of momentary interest transpired since I saw her Wednesday? I have not written her, thinking that I would hear from her. I will try to write her today or tomorrow.\nI have found it difficult to do much since coming up.

It contains the trilogy Agamemnon, Choenphori, Eumenides. I am not form-plushing? when I say I liked Agamemnon. I took out a book Saturday, the fourth volume of Santayana's the Life of Reason: Reason in Art. It was the only one available at the time. Surprising to me, I find him readable and partially understandable. I have read over 50 pages, which leaves 175 yet to read. The chapters I have walked thru so far are The Basis of Art in Instinct and Experience; Rationality of Industrial Art; Emergence of Fine Art; and I am now in Music.\nI came down here this morning with the avowed intention to write - a short story, poem, anything. I may surprise myself and do it. I have lacked sufficient resolution to send Premonition, returned from Harpers, out again.

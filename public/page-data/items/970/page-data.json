The heathen Preacher, Wangomend, had also in their year came on from gorehgoshink, to see if he should be able to succeed in propagating his foolish doctrines; feel the Indian brethren bid him to go to their children and learn of them. \nToward the fall of their year, two valuable, worthy, and exemplary National Assistants? departed their life; the one John Papienhomb at Delaware: and the other Joshua of the Mohiccan Tribe. Both were at their respective places, Wardens of the Congregation, the former of Thornbrun, and the latter of Graden-hutten; Joshua was one of the first Indians baptized by the Brethren in 1742*.\nDisputes having arisen between Great Britain and her North American Colonies, and a Congress being appointed by the latter; there again appointed Commissioners, to convene the Northern and Western nations to a meeting at Pittsburgh for the purpose of explaining the nature of the disputes to them, -and giving them their advice.

There stated: that the commissioners, after first having informed them, that disputes had arisen between the King of England and the People of their country- and that their quarreling with each other could not affect them in any wise, provided they did not interfere, and take a part in it: next proceeded to state the cause from wheree the dispute had originated, calling the same a family dispute- a quarrel between a Parent and his Child- much after this manner (said they). Suppose a father has a little son whom he loves and indulges while young, but growing up to be a youth, begins to think of having some help from him- and making up a small pack, he bids him carry this for him. The boy cheerfully taken their pack up, following his father with it. The father finding the boy willing and obedient, continues in their way and as the boy grows stronger, is the father makes the pack in proportion larger, yet, as long as the boy is able to carry the pack, he does so without grumbling. At length however the boy having now arrived at manhood- while the father is making up the pack for him to carry, in earnes a person of an evil disposition, and learning for whom to carry a heavy pack- The father, listening rather to the bad adviser then -commanding- his own judment- and the feelings of","fdb2d833c20be9c8e5944e64a3fa8241.jpg"],[61872,"of a tender father; follows the advise of the hard hearted adviser, and makes up a heavy load for his son to carry. The son, now grown up examining the weigh of the load he is to carry: --- the parent in the words: \"Dear Father this pack is too heavy for me to carry; do may lighten it; I am willing to do what I can but am unable to carry this load.\" The fathers heart having by this time become hardened and the bad adviser calling to him: whip him if he is disobeys, and refuses to carry the pack, now in a peremptory tone orders his son to take up the pack and carry it off or he will whip him; and already taken up a stick to beat him.\"So!\" says the son \"am I to be served this for not doing what I am unable to do.\" Well- of enheatier avail nothing with you father? and if is to be decided by -blown-, whether or not I am able to carry a pack so heavy; then I have no other choice left me, but that of reniting your unreasonable demand, by my strength; and thees by striking each other learn who is the strongest.\" Such, (Indian reports stated) won the parable given there, for the purpose of explaining the nature of the dispute.\nThese further reported: that the commissioners, had told them, that as the dispute did not concern them, it would be highly wrong in them (the American people) were they to ask the aid of their Indian Brethren, in bringing","6bb9db444280b488513fb5b7bb3dc554.jpg"],[61873,"bringing the dispute between them and the Parent to a close. For by so doing they would be made parties to the quarrel, which might involve them in difficulties and dangers, particularly as it could not be foreseen, in where favour the quarrel would terminate. That were they to ask the assistance of their Brethren the Indians and they together should fail in gaining what they sought for: they would have to join the other side. That these fore they would advise them, to -- still untell the content should be over - be friends to both sides- not take up the Hatchet a gainsh either side- for, by taking the hatchet up to strike either side, they must infallibly create to themselves an enemy who should it so happen, that he became the Conqueror, would punish the,- take their land from them - \"And further:\" that as in the course of the war it might happen that their Brethren the Americans would not have it in their power to supply them with all that they might want: they: not having taken up arms against the British, would consequently be supplied from that side; with each Articles as they stood in need of- Finally, that their American Brethren sought their welfare and having land enough of their own, did not","0af1406bb73ac817d0b31bef141636a8.jpg"],[61874,"with to deprive them of their bed sought to secure their constant friend whip or brother who had sprung up together from one and the same soil- tht they wished to make them a great People, and that they would do so to every nation and People, that should take the advised herewith given the.

Lastly, (the aeporlem added) that in consequence of the good advise given them by their American Brethren; the Chist of the Delaware present at this Treaty had for themselves and in the Name of the whole Nation declared to the Commissioners: that they would remain neutral, during the contest between the Parent and the Son- and lift up the Hatchet against either side\"\nAbout this time, while a number of the Jenecca were at Pittsburgh; perhaps more for the purpose of learning the disposition of the western Nations but more particularly that of the Delawares with regard to the side they should take during the contest they had an opportunity of hearing Captain White Eyes, deliver \n\n the Jenecca Tribe of the 6 Nations in the most sealike Tribe of them,","b7afeb44b1ed92c3195db7a2e94815d1.jpg"],[61875,"143.\ndeliver his sentiments openly declaring in favour of the American People and their cause which so chagrined them, that they thought proper to offer a check to his proceedings by giving him in a haughty tone a [] intended to remind him who the Deleware Nation were in the Eye of the 6 Nations meaning that there had no will of their own but were subordinate to the 6 Nations when Captain White Ete long since tired of the language with his [[]] spirit and an air of disdain, [[]] and replied that he well knew that they, the 6 Nations, considered his nation as a conquered People and their [[]]- \"You say (said he) that you had conquered me\"*- that you had cut off my legs-had put a petticoat on me, giving me a hoe and corn pounder in my hands, saying now Woman! you [[]] henceforward shall be to plant-hoe corn and pound the same for bred for us Man and \"Warriors!\"- \"Look (continued White Eyes) at my Legs!

I feel very, very sorry, sorry that you are so disappointed in your school,\noutings, prospects & enjoyments. I feared that it would be so \nimport; for I know that much of your enjoyment last year\nat Morietta was in your persual & family friends. I was\nafraid you would miss them too much now. But I will tell\nyou how to do. You must \"grin & bear it.\" I know you can\ngrin well enough but whether you can bear it with a\ngood grace is another question. I wish I could see you\ngrin once. I'd grin back again & woo you, grin-to-grin\nfor a while I \"rekon\". Now chin up old hearty. I feel in\nreal cracking spirits. I have just been writing to Sarah,\n& that is always as good as a dose of exhilirating gas to\nme. I was real sober when I commenced, but slowly I grew\nbuoyant, til now I am through, I could sail away the clouds\nin a canoe made of moonshine & ponies, I am so light. Now my\nbrother, I am satisfied of one thing, that is, that the feelings I\ncherish for her are as deep, as the profoundest depths of the \nhuman soul. Dont you have one fear that when she is mine, my\nwhole life, strength, mind & heart will not be devoted to her happiness.\nI feel that I shall have but one thought, wish, aspiration\n& hope. That will be to make her happy. Our post acquaintoner\nhas not been pleasant as we could wish, but it has been occasional\nby her unequalable devotion to her departed our x the peculiar feelings\nthat has inspired in her. No devotee of religion cherishes anything\nwith a more profound respect that I regard thier feelings of her.\nShe is but slightly aware of the depth & strength of this respect in my\nheart. Her devotion to him is the grounds of my hopes in her.

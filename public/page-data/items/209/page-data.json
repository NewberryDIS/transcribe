I assure you the loneliness was not all on your side, for when I looked at your chair, on going into the choir, I felt quite melancholy, and when Mr Paull? took possession of it; I had serious ideas of pulling it from under him. Mr. Marshall was quite concerned when I told him you would not return until autumn, but smiled very significantly, and said, \"Oh! he cant stay away that long I know\", I only laughed and said perhaps not, innocent youth! he evidently thinks we are very devoted and our Julie entirely forgotten, I wonder if he forgets the time, he informed you the music would be improved if you would take a different look.

What do you suppose Julie talked to me about from before Christmas until the night she left me? ask her, if I ever complained of great fatigue. I never profess a friendship unless I feel it, and whatever interests my friends. of course I am with them, now do not forget what I say to you in this subject, if I had you beside me, I should look you in the eyes, and say. \"do you hear\"? very sharply (as you know I can) and then I am certain you would remember, I was dreadfully disappointed at not finding Julie. I was almost certain she would come, or at least send a letter, but not one word, I know nothing more than when I saw you, except that she is still at West River, and will meet Alex in Annapolis in about two weeks. they will then go to different watering places, and return about the first of September. This information, I dragged out of Mrs. Murray, Till tells me they blame me entirely for Jules fancy for you, funny is'nt it? My shoulders are not very broad, but I am willing to match my head against any of theirs, and I am determined to settle the Queen Bee, before I am done with her.

Should you go to the mountains, how long will you remain? your vision of Saturday night was correct at a quarter past nine, we stood round the fountain but Lizzy drank the Pineapple, like a man without even winking, confound Caufman? I would much rather have been without him, but I would'nt take his arm, though I was so lame from my sprained ankle, that I could scarcely limp along. I have been confined to the house for two or three days with it, but I am happy to say Richard is himself again. Mr. Paull? escorted Lizzy on Sunday night and offered his arm very kindly to me also, but I declined, and took up with my sister and Mr. Pannarck?, of course we went for mineral water and as it was a very warm evening, the poor fountain was drained, the ice consumed, and Mr. Townsend left fainting in a corner, from his great exertion in waiting on these horribly wicked Trinity church people","b392dca108c8ee6df76b33b12fb0921e.jpg"],[47142,"who always will come to drink on Sunday evenings.  I shant give your regards to Lizzy, because I do not intend telling her that we correspond.  She knows nothing of you and Julie, and of course could not understand why you should write to me any more that to her or anyone else, dont you think I am right. I will kiss little Sallie for you with great pleasure though she has the Hooping cough, and if I catch it in doing your bidding, you will have to come and nurse me through it. How you must have enjoyed your first hunt.  I only wish I could accept your invitation and go with you next time, though it should be in the humble situation of cook. I'll take that ride, through those pleasant  woods. Have you had another Pic Nic? We had such a pleasant afternoon only this day week too, why it seems an age since then, you must not shock your Grandmother by playing on Sunday, but go to church or write to me, all the same thing.  I thank you for your kindness in wishing I had your flowers, some one, I shant say who sent me a beautiful bouquet this morning which I am at present enjoying extravagantly. As it is very near dark and my letter must be in the office this evening in order to reach you tomorrow, I shall have to leave you without having said half I want to. Have you heard anything more of your quarrelsome friends? I entreat you, keep out of all trouble in future. You cannot imagine how very anxious I have been and still am about that horrible fight. I feel as though I should hear more of it. Oh! I beseech you do not be drawn into another if you can possibly avoid it.  How does Miss Chislett enjoy herself?  Lizzy came for me to go with her to the Post office, was the first I knew of her writing.  I hope Ellen will answer her letter, I was in the Cemetery this morning at the funeral of Dr. Stevenson, I saw Miss Sarah at her Piano as I passed the window, Lizzy & I still talk about Washington and the pleasure we had all through you and your family. I should like to send my love to your sisters, but as they too & Miss Chislett in particular would not understand how I came to write . it is better not.

I am almost baked, you ought to be very thankful that you are out of town, Your very acceptable letter I have this moment read, as my amiable brother has carried it in his jaket since yesterday morning. And now let me come at the Julie subject at once, I had a letter from her last week, and I think she is taken up with telling me how very warm it is, but just wait a moment I'll read her letter again and see, Yes she does say something else, she goes to church every morning at six and every evening at half past five, dont you wish we did, but Ah! I'm afraid any good days are over. She rose at half past three and took a ride on horseback, now that was sensible wasnt it?  really there is nothing in her note, for it is nothing more, but rest easy","51ce4bb4ea45ba0ccc228bd2750534f6.jpg"],[47145,"she is very well and weighs 125 pounds, think of that.  I have not the least idea of getting sick either, I never felt better in my life than I do just now, my trip to the country has done me a world of good, and as for my appetite, the rest of the family have no chance at all, and from Will it is so weak he can scarcely wallk, for want of something to eat, I clear the table before he gets started. I suppose you think this is not true very well, just come and see, Oh!  I have had a fine time for the last two weeks riding on horse back by moonlight looking for ghosts, which of course you know I believe in, andy quantity of nice Pic Nics, sociable ones like ours as Washington  romantic walks, reading interesting books in the woods, and on Fourth of July, we had fireworks of every description which I could have dispensed with, as I am not particularly attached to that style of amusement, but now all is over, and I shall roast here for at least three or four weeks as Father stated this morning for Cape May, and my sister on Monday , for Fayette, Mother and I will be alone, A. E. intended going on Friday, but was detained by Grace who was very sick for two or three days.  I did not see them as they left the day before I returned.  I do not know whether I","f64487e0fbd209b870ec1970372decb3.jpg"],[47146,"shall get back to Fayette of not, it depends a great deal upon the stay Father makes, as I could not persuade myself to leave mother just now, Mary Israel went to Bedford Springs this morning. Mrs Olden took tea with Mother and A. E. last Thursday but said nothing of Sallie's being very sick, but I shall go this evening and inquire particularly how she is. Lizzie Shaler staid all night with me the night before I went to Deer Creek, and I have not seen her since, she does not know I am at home. I changed my mind about your message to her, I delivered it; and read her a few sentences of your letter as I came to the sage conclusions that it did not make any difference whether she understood why we corresponded or not, but she has good sense when she chooses to use it.  So all's well, from charming friend Frederick I met the evening before I went to D. C. and he informed me that he started to pay me a visit a fes evenings before, but for some reason, did not reach the desired goal, my first impulse was to groan, but I was afraid he would think I took fits like his sister and rush to my rescue, so I controlled myself and said \"Ah! that was unfortunate,\" and upon the instant informed him that I would be out of town for two weeks. I hope by this time he is refreshing himself with the cool breezes of the mountains","962d80e7eb91811e9d244950f352fccc.jpg"],[47147,"You will miss unclear Chislett? very much when she leaves, I believe you said she would be home to day.  I took a hearty laugh over your description of Jacks arrival, but I thought you would bring Ellen home and I should se you, But dont come until you cannot help it for I assure you the heat is intolerable and you would wish yourself luck again as soon as we had our talk out.  I wont offend again by saying you only like me & write to me on Jule's account.  I wont indeed, I do it thoughtlessly.  I am so glad to hear there is no prospect of another fight: fro I assure you i wa very uneasy, I have scarcely a hope that you can read my writing for I am so careless about it.; I was just? shocked to hear that unclear had returned to his old ways , for though I feel but little interest in him I am always sorry to hear of any young man drinking.  I have not been to the Choir since I wrote, and do not know whether My Marshall has left or not; but Mr Murray's unclear is better and I presume she will continue to sing of course I shall go on Saturday night, but I promise you unclear shant take me home and there will be only two drinks of mineral water, Lizzy and your humble servant. So you are in love with Kate very well, just send me an invitation to the meddling.  I am sorry you are disappointed in your miniscul arrangements for the summer, as for the mountain it is no matter you might have ben bitten by a snake.  I did not see one, good luck, wasn't it. 3 o'clock, Just before dinner I had a visit from Lizzy who gave me all the nes. Mr Marshall has gone and he has invited Ginnie Ormsby into the choir to sing second, of course A. E. will go down stairs as if she is willing. I will use all my influence to present her singing with unclear, who might possible strike by chance one true note in a day, but she is not to come up until Mr Marshall returns and as she is to marry Dr Morgan, she'll soon drop off. so after all it's no matter, Your SAlly is much better, Lizzy says she is getting well, Henry Israel says you are to be here on Saturday evening, I wish I knew whether it was true.  if I though it I would not send this letter, but keep every thing to tell you, I want to ty and answer all your questions.  I did not ask Jull who told her, but I presume Mrs B. Oh! do you know that in telling me unclear Chislett? sent for something you left out the word, but from what wollows, I presume it was our daguerreotype she wanted. am I right? Rather rich isn't it: I suppose she want to have your","6cf8108524c6c65e8b9a65d1e6c29222.jpg"],[47148,"likeness painted perhaps she'll send it to me.  I wish I had the Message Bird. I shall miss it very much next Sunday for whilst I was in the country I had everything to  amuse me. One Sunday we had a sort of Pic Nic whilst the good ones were at church but the next one I took myself up and read my Prayer Book.  Why did'nt the little Dr go to see any body whilst he was in town. Will would have been so glad to have had a talk with him and Lizzy too. I dont speak for  myself as I was away. but both Liz & I took quite a fancy to him. Dont dream such horrible things about me any more, for if you dream I am to married it is a sign I shall die and vice versa.  I am not ready for either by any means, about as much in the humor for one as the other.  To day I insisted upon having diner on the back porch, which is covered with vines, and just as we sat down, bless us, but it did storm, the rain came pelting in.  I insisted upon unclear the rainy place and ate away.  I thought Will would have killed himself laughing at amy  unclear table That's what I get for being romantic and wishing to eat in our arbor.  To morrow there is to be a grand Pic Nic, to which I believe the whole of Allegheny country is inviter.  I have said NO!  I thank you, I unclear envy you, your flowers. many thanks for thinking of me, when you enjoy them so much yourself.  I wrote this morning to unclear before I got your letter.  As I have a letter to my sister to accomplish before tea time , I must stop for the present.  Oh!  I am almost melted.  I wish I could go to sleep, but I must write, or she will think she is terribly neglected.

When I told them in the choir what I had done, they were quite offended but I told Annie if she had come to rehearsal it would have been different, so we sang the Psalm and Hymn, but oh! the evening,!! there was glory, there was fame!!!! Mr Paull, induced Mr Fleming to come, and unclear insisted upon singing the chants, Annie seemed to wish it, and I gave in, to my sorrow for such a time, you never saw. The Gloria in excelsis and first chant went well enough, but in, \"Praise the Lord,\" someone behind me got the words wrong which sounded so funny, that I laughed out, and started Annie, you will scarcely believe it, but she shook and laughed until I thought she would drop, of course we could'nt sing and laugh both","2cadae13ba5d12067c91689efb2ce30c.jpg"],[47153,"so the laugh had it, and for a good while Mr Fleming had it all inserted above the evening, I mean back to the line to himself, he was a great blessing to us I can tell you, for we should have gone entirely to pieces, if it had not been for him, I intend to send him a note of thanks through Henry Israel. Such a ridiculous scene you can scarcely imagine, it was infinitely worse than that renowned Friday. unclear had a Mr. Cook there too, who I dont doubt thought we were all crazy. Ah! it was great fun, and oh! how I wish for you if you had only come last Saturday, all this would not have happened, I am just screaming and laughing now at the recollection of the scene. I felt very sorry for Annie, she is so good and was dreadfully disinterested at even smiling in church, after it was over I think she took a small cry to herself. I was laughing so hard I could scarcely see, but I thought she was in distress. The instanant church was out I rushed down the stairs to get rid of my ancient enemy unclear and catch Mrs Hilden? who was writing for me, and I have not seen any of my fellow sinners since. After this fuss I almost made up my mind to","d91aaf5363e934641265b76ef75b504f.jpg"],[47154,"start for Fayette on Saturday and get rid of all choir proceedings until Mr. Marshall returns but now I begin to draw back, and think I wont leave until Father comes. We have heard from him at Cape May, he was very sick at Hollidaysburg but is better again, and writes in good spirits. We have had several letters from sister at Fayette, she says it is delightful up there and begs us to come, I think I shall go, but not for some time yet, I hope the Chisletts will be home again before I leave as I dont want to know them any better than I do. I could not keep Lizzy from spending the day. she was particularly invited, and her Mother insisted upon her going, but she would not stay all night, and has entirely given up the idea of spending a week with them. Ellen is much mistaken if she thinks Liz has taken, forgive and forget for her unclear, as from her present humor, I do not think she will do either very soon, though you must not expose I am influencing her, for I have merely impressed it upon her mind that she must be careful what she says before them, and when she came in from the Cemetery on Wednesday evening, she came & told me, she was so glad that I had plead with her to take care  she said, as she was pumped (to use an elegant expression) about what she knew of the fight in Washington, and everything they could think of, but as she told me all that passed, I think Lizzy came off with flying colours. Miss Chislett rather talked that night at Mrs Shalers? as though they knew all about your fuss after the concert, but it is not so, they only found out there was some kind of a fuss, but are not even sure that you were in it; for Lizzy says Ellen questioned her as to what time you left us, after the concert & c with 2 vertical lines below e with 2 vertical lines below. but she says luckily the questions were too particular. if she had generalized there would have been a tight pull for the truth, and I think she is convinced that we know nothing of it; if she","b159ec8f6491707d43d01b12ab60e31b.jpg"],[47155,"5.\nasks me, I'll let her know very soon, that no matter what I had heard, she certainly would get the benefit of it.

Dr A. had gone to Brighton, so I went to Dr Wilson, opposite Dr Snyder, a very nice little man and excellent surgeon, he came down and examined it, recommended poultices and said he would return on Saturday and see how it looked then; according to promise he came, laid it open, punched it all round with a long silver instrument, and hurt me not a little. but I looked out the window and did not feel at all sick, but no needle did he find, so I am still at the poultices, but it is decidedly better and I think in a fair way of getting well, notwithstanding the non appearance of the","0293c5c9aa07b74d40e552caa1f7d162.jpg"],[47157,"needle, I felt very like writing to you on Sunday, but Mrs. Olden came for me in the afternoon to go to church, whish I declined, but persuaded her to stay with me, so we made ourselves comfortable, and talked all afternoon, did your ears burn? Sarah wanted to know if I thought there was anything between you and unclear, the question rather startled me but of course I was much surprised and wanted to know what made her think that. well she could not tell exactly, but she had got the idea into her head, and then unclear went away systeriously, at such an unpleasant season of the year, she was convinced there was some reason for it. I laughed at the idea, said I supposed Jule wanted a trip, I was perfectly astonished for I did not know any one. but unclear suspected there was any reason for Jules going away, and I set that down to he quick eyes of love, which could penetrate the walls of the Tower of London, Sarah's questions were very innocently asked and because she took and interest in you, but she little thought how near she came to the truth.

Before I forget it, let me tell you that if you ever say that my name is Hannah again I'll cut your acquaintance. so I look like Hannah? would you suppose it. Ah! shame now it begins with H, but for heavens sake dont think it's Hannah, What object could unclearhave in starting the report of Mr Wills' death, I cannot see, now if it had been you, I could imagine some reason, as if you were killed off, there would be a better chance for other people.

Thaler told Lizzy long ago that Mr. Paull was engaged, every body seems to know it. the rehearsal took refuge from the storm at Mr Thalers on Saturday night; and I can tell you we had a pretty heavy one. Hail stones as large as walnuts, constant lightning, altogether it was quite alarming to scury people. I for my part enjoyed it very much, but it has done considerable damage in the neighborhood. That horse accident was terrible indeed, poor young girl, I feel so sorry for her, and hope she may recover. I forgot to tell you of Frank Finneys death, he died whilst I was at Deer Creek.

The Fayette season was almost over when I went and as I took a most violent cold, which in that cold climate only increased daily, I thought home the best place and accordingly started, on Tuesday afternoon, spent the night in Uniontown & reached Pittsburgh on Wednesday afternoon, during the evening my travelling companion Miss Leech, proposed we should start in the morning for Brighton. I agreed, and our trunks left down stairs, in readiness, Father and Mother proposed joining the party and here we are, except the old lady & gentleman who returned in the 2 o'clock train.

On the unclear man subject I cannot be touched, as he has pestered me into the dislike I have taken towards him, but the coffee, I grant you. I did take a cup the evening I took sick but have not touched it since. I should be very well if I could get rid of this cold, which I took through not fault of my own, as at Fayette they put one to sleep in damp sheets, enough to kill a strong man, to say nothing of a sick mortal like myself. I did not discover it, but Miss Leech, told me in the morning that such was the fact, of course it will take some time for the","2a181a20189b9b4366056ff6f88271f3.jpg"],[47163,"effects to wear off. I dont think Fayette paid for the trouble of going. I have this cold, A. E. was quite ill Grace & Dick both took whooping cough, what do you think? I did not see Kate Hopkins, except a glimpse just as she was starting home, I was very sorry , as I wanted to know her, and meant to be as sociable and clever as I knew how, even before I got your lecture on stiffness, which indeed I dont think i deserve, except where I take a dislike, do I? I begin to think you know me pretty well, I was in one of my nervous humors when I wrote the last long letter. (for the others were only notes) and as miserable as I could be, though I hoped it would not show itself in my letter, I was indifferent to every body, and every thing but I am better of that and hope to be restored to my usual feelings before I see you.

I hope the excitement will not make Ma sick again. she has been better for a few days than she was. she has been better since we heard from Frank. We had a letter from him on Monday written on Thursday after the fight at Williamsburg. He was safe and well, very busy among the wounded. He says the loss was terrible on both sides, and that it was wonderful that our men were not entirely cut to pieces, as the","448819edc92a34b24c53b88af83969b5.jpg"],[47307,"enemy greatly outnumbered them and were so strongly entrenched.

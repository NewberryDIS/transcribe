I did not go to tea until after dark and when I cam out of the house after tea it was very dark and raining so that I found it difficult to find the gate, but when once on the sidewalk I thought I was all right, but for some reason or another, I started to run, perhaps","2bb5b9363cc844be62b30d51570b661c.jpg"],[36893,"it was because I disliked to be out in the rain and darkness.

It shows very plainly the effect of gossiping.  If this course is persisted in by the disaffected I fear it will lead to still more trouble.  But because a certain few cannot rule they are becoming amost frantic.  We have been trying to reconcile matters but it is very evident none of us are wise enough to do that in our own strength.  Our only hope is in fervent prayer that each one of us did possess brotherly","1942335e5a6ac5588499a46d7839500b.jpg"],[37009,"love that would forbid us to speak evil of one another; and that each one might pray in the words of the Psamist, \"Set a watch, O Lord, before my month; keep the door of my life.\"  Pray for us dear sister that we may have wisdom to act prudently and trust in God who maketh all things work together for the good of them who love him.

Well, I have set out to write you a long letter but how well I shall succeed remains to be told.  You have certainly furnished me with questions, which if well answered will help fill this sheet.  I will try to answer them as well as I can.  I did not read Jennie Prichard's letter as I had an opportunity to hand it to her before I had read it.\nYou have perhaps heard of the death of Morris Lewis ere this.  He died while west in Iowa at the house of Rev. Mr. Rowlands, formerly of Collinsville, after a sickness of about two weeks of first Lung Feaver which terminated in Quick","d59d3945f524d3df42f2b6f9fce7dccf.jpg"],[37016,"Consumption.  He died a week ago last Saturday.  His family did not hear of his illness until a dispatch came last Monday Morning that he was very sick and requesting his wife to come out to him.  Another dispatch came about noon saying that he was dead and that his remains were on their way home.  Mrs Lewis of course did not start.  The news was very shocking to her and she felt it very keenly.  The body reached here Friday Morning and the funeral was held in the Pres. Ch in the P.M.  How loudly this speaks to us -- \"For health prepare for death.\"  Yes we should learn to listen to these teachings of God's providence and profit by them.\nSarah is to commence her school tomorrow.  They came after her today and she has","1b1d0f63ba3cef1576c8f46fe8d2810d.jpg"],[37017,"gone.  Her school is about ten miles from here, four miles west of Martinsburg up on Lug Hill.  I hope and trust she will like teaching.  She wished me to tell you to expect an answer to your letter soon as she did not consider that little note she sent you an answer to yours but if you saw fit to answer that she would not object.  I am not bording there now as they do not intend to keep any borders while Sarah is away.  I have got back again to Mrs. Van Konghuet's.  I listened to our excellent sermon from Mr.Persons this P.M.  Text Matt 14:46.  \"the pearle of great price.\"  He has but one Sabbath more here unless something is done this week to hire him for another year.  If he goes I fear we will have no pastor this summer, as","90ed295b92cc70a1f31a790917b6b832.jpg"],[37018,"three fourths of the church are very anxious to have him stay and a great many will not be willing to support another man if the few are allowed to rule Mr. P. out.  I have thought that it would be reconciling matters somewhat to let Mr. P. go and get another minister but now I see that would be trying to please everybody and thereby pleasing nobody in reality.  I hope and trust that he may be retained.\nI should think by your letter that you had been having a clearing up time in your portfolio answering all the letters that had been long neglected.  My portfolio needs the same kind of \"cleaning out.\"  I am glad that the Mr.... Sugar suited.  I paid 35 cts. Ex. Chg's.  We have more but it would not be profitable to send a dollars worth alone.

I do not know who should keep the book of Degree membership in your lodge but should think the W.S.  In our lodge the W.D.S. keeps it as there is no F.S. in a Degree Lodge.  Formerly there were three Degrees but one degree has been dispensed with and now the Initiatory Degree is styled the first, Fidelity the second and that of Charity the third.  The numbing of the degrees were however is somewhat misunderstood perhaps by","73b674607505d4ed05cafc2437953321.jpg"],[37020,"all as the ritual books of the degrees are numbered first and second, but after the next session of the Grand Lodge in Sept at Poughkeepsie this will probably be arranged.

I wish inform you, but I must candidly say, I don't know.  This, as well as a good many other prints is a little misty with us.  My opinion is that the blank you sent is intended for a lodge where there is no Degree Temple connected with it and that it is to be filled out b the W. Treas.of Sub. Lodge when a applies for and pays for a degree; and this is a sufficient certificate to any D. Templar of whatever Degree Temple that the person has applied and paid for said degree.  The record is kept on the left end of the blank which is left in the book by the W.S. when the degree is inferred.  This blank could be rolled in your","82a18be815545032604c62c7fec63653.jpg"],[37034,"Lodge by the W. Treas. discarding the left-end, which it appears to me does not amount to any thing.

None must have any farther intercourse with their wives till the war was concluded, shortly before starting on an expedition the priest collected all the warriors into the council house, He then took a post, about three feet long, painted red, and set it between the white seats and the door, covered the upper end with a fawn's skin, and on this placed his diamond stone. Then standing between the post and the door with his fan towards the diamond, and also towards the ark?, standing in the holy place, back of the white seats. He prayed to an old person in the east and an old star for aid. He then called upon a very great man to shield them from their enemies. Having done this, he ordered the warriors to march by the post, on which lay the diamond; and if they were to be successful, and return safe, the diamond, it is said, sparkled, and sent for a brilliant light, which struck them as they passed; but on those who would not return safe, in case they went to the war, the diamond did not shine. Such, of course, were dismissed and sent home. \nNow fire was then made and put into the ark? for the war.

But when the people of the Town were Liernd? so scattered as not to be able to hear his voice, he raised the war whoop, which was immediately caught by all the warriors who heard it, and reached in every part of the town. Each warrior on raising the war whoop, started for the place of rendervous, i.e the house of the war priest, who, on Their arrival immediately sounded the war trumpet (of the Thigh bone of a crane) and pitched battle. \nBut suppose another nation sent a challenge, or made a declaration of war, The news of this ? to the captain of the host, or the so consulted his seven counsellors & principal war priest, returned answer that he would must? the nation thus challenging them, and immediately dispatched his warriors to the ? war priest: and he again his, and thus runners were were on the wing night & day till each war priest, on recieving the message, & starting his runner to the town, ? called his men by a loud talk, or by the war whoop, & immediately set forward on.

This new fire, in the ark, was used during the whole expedition. The first day of this march they passed (and probaly? ? more or less during the first seven days) and on the seventh night they kept a vigil, when, by various ceremonies they were purified, & equipped for the war, After this they had only to consult the priest to know how and when they were to attack their enemies, and how many they were to kill. The priest place the red post, fawn skin, diamond, and ark, before him, as in the council house, and fixing his eyes on the ark, prayed as before: and then, partly by means of the diamond, and partly by heads, gave his instructions, and oracles. Having approached near the enemy, all halted. The priest first advanced, and addressed the warriors, ? to trust in God, and not be afraid, assuring them that, if God pleased He would bring all back in safety. Then the head warrior came forward, and addressed his men, in substance, as follows. - If any of you have left a young woman whom you intended to marry, and are troubled about her, now return. If any of you have left a wife, and are fearful that some other man will sleep with her, now return home. If any of you have left property of any kind, about which you are troubled, now return, and take care of it.

If we conquer our enemies, it will be because God fights for us: and if we return in safety, it will be God who will preserve us. Therefore put your trust in God. The light is his, and he can make it light about you. Each war priest had from 50 to a 100 men under his direct command. (The war flag being hoisted) seven from one company stepped forward, towards the fire, one of them put a war club down before them, & then all the seven commenced the war song. The first verse of which was, yo wi hi, hi yo wi ye, four times repeated. After they had sung on verse, a certain man came forward, and took up the war club & marched back & forth with it, while the seven raised the war whoop. And so on through the other six versus. This ceremony was performed successively by seven men out of each company i.e. town. This being performed, the A Te' que yo hi or war dance commenced, ? This each had his principal weapon raised in his right hand; and all formed a circle round the fire, and (turn ?)","8e1a55a1535aa5c1d5ffe25e39e1e2b2.jpg"],[70712,"28 Warfare Or.? 537\nand afraid of the enemy, now return home. After this all who retained their position in the army, were supposed to be bold, unembarrassed, and efficient warriors, and therefore they generally engaged with great confidence & fierceness in the fight. During the contest the priest stands back, unless when he sees the warriors giving way, and then goes forward with great fury, & either conquors or dies. The conflict being ended, they set their fans towards home, but not hastily nor disorderly. Before arriving at the town where they resided, a messenger was sent forward to give notice of their approach, and of their intention to be at a certain place, at a given time. To that place therefore the people repaired at the specified time. to the warriors approached, two men, followed by the women, advanced towards them, commencing a hymn in honour of their valour and warlike deeds. Then the women caught the hymn, and went forward chanting their praise. I have one verse of a hymn ancient by sung on such occasions, + but it is not ? understood. Each warriors delivered his spoil to his wife, or nearest female relative, who took it home, while the warriors continued their march to the town house, where they were met by the resident priests, and all the people to express their joy in a dance. After this was over, and after the warriors had returned home they associated with their wives as usual, but not before. + Hi yo ya yu we - four times repeated.","2b49d64b583102469cbb481893ba2c6f.jpg"],[70713,"538 29\nWhen a direct conflict or fair open battle was intended, the place of halting previous to the battle was the place from which the warriors were to start. Therefore after address of the priest, + the other's head warrior, all being rowdy for the engagement, the trumpet was blown, by a person selected. This trumpet was made of the thigh bone of a large kind of cranes, and was sometimes a foot & half long. This made a shrill, but loud noise, i.e. might be heard a great distance. The trupmt being blown, the warriors immediately raised the war whoop, and sprung for the battle. They ran so as to form two wings, as if to enclose the enemy, which the priest for the war directly not the priest of the contending tribe, & either killed or was killed, while the doctor stayed behind. Thomas Smith But the general method of the Cherokees was to set an ambush for their enemies so as to form an acute angle, Drawing of acute angle and send out a few men, that their enemies might suppose they had but few to contend with, till they found themselves unexpectedly surrounded. Many stratagems were used to draw the enemy into danger.

Some placing their diamond in due form, & praying for assistance, and, it is said, the warrior, or warriors, moving round in it. If they went quite round so as to return to the place from where they started in the diamond, they would return safe: but if they stopped on the way round & vanished, they were to die. So also with regard to persons going off on any other business. Some had a peculiar kind of very thin stones, of a whitish colour, these they took to a stream of water, prayed to the beings named above, and then threw the stones on the water. If they swam off some distance, and then returned to the shore before sinking, all would be well. But if they sunk before they reached the shore, the person, or persons one whose behalf they were used would die, & not return. The stones also, when a person or persons were to die, turned, it is said, to a bloody colour. During the day, all concerned, fasted, except as they drank some of the water of conjuration from the creek. Others again had a small, but very curious trough, holding about a gill, filled with water. In this they put two grains, resembling grains of powder.","af988dac0be87d8212e0c32b17327d85.jpg"]],"transcount":8,"percentTranscribed":5,"date":[],"category":"Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

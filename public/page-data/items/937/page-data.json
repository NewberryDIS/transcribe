Crossing the Mississippi river at Burlington in the evening of October 14th, 1840, arriving at my journeys end.  Burlington at that time was quite a small town with less than two thousand inhabitants.  The principal business was done on upper Main Street.  The Territorial Officers. Governor Chambers and Secretary \"Stull\" lived in and occupied the house on the west side of upper Main Street between Court and High, now owned by the Harris family and well known as the Harris boarding house.  It was head quarters","8fc3746a31903fde7291b95606953438.jpg"],[58304,"2\nfor the transaction of the Government and Territorial business which gave upper Main Street the appearance of the business portion of the town.  I was only nineteen years of age when I arrived here.  I felt as though I had considerable wild oats to sow and was very proud of my horse that had carried me through to Iowa.  He had proved himself to be of everlasting endurance and speed.  During the winter of 1840 I would occasionally go out in the country some five or six miles to visit my early made friend Wm. F. Johnson and spend a few days in hunting wolves.  Johnson was very fond of hunting.  He and his brother inlaws Parrots, kept a pack of hounds and was always willing and ready to mount his horse and with his tin horn call up his dogs and start for the prairie between","2135f286f9bf1a08da5138177388c998.jpg"],[58305,"3\nMiddletown and New London which was thinly settled and would soon scare up a wolf or two for the sport of enjoying the chase.  The baying of the houjds as they strike the trale was very exciteing to both the hunters and horses as we started in hot pursuit.  We paid no attention to the cornfields and fences but kept right on after the dogs and game.  about the time the dogs would capture and pounce on the wolf.  You might distinguish the voice of Johnson for at least one mile off urging his dogs to hold on.  He scarcely ever let a snowfall go by without giving chase to either a fox, wolf or deer.  My curiosity was very much excited about the wolves, as I had never seen one until my arrival in Iowa.  In traveling through Illinois to Iowa, I often herd them howling of a night around some of the farm houses.","cfd8d02e47cadd075600b187e18582be.jpg"],[58306,"4\nbut I was not in Iowa a great while before I killed the first one I ever saw.  It was the first snow fall. I was going out on the agency road and on the wild prairie where the Desmoines County fair grounds is now located.  I discovered one a trotting along off to my right.  I at once put whip to my horse and gave chase and soon overhauled him.  The snow being deep in was to the wolf disadvantage.  And I urged my horse over him tramping and knocking him down with his feet as he would pass over him and by the time I could check my horse up and turn around, the wolf would be up and running another direction but I would soon overhaul him.  Each time my horse would tramp him down with his feet and the wolf soon became tired and worn out.","02acb85d4ecc59751189831c084897f5.jpg"],[58307,"5\nAs I had no other mode of warfare, I unbuckled my stirrup leather from the saddle which had an iron stirrup attached.  Then rideing over him once more and knocking him down, I jumped off my horse and beat his brains out with the stirrup.  I then mounted my horse with the wolf prize and brought him in to McLeash's livery stable on upper Main Street where afterwards Luke Palmer build his Grand Opera House.  Since destroyed by fire June 19th, 1873, and will hereafter contain the Desmoines County Court House which will change the appearance very much from what it was when I first came to Burlington in 1840, and at that time the whole territory of this great State only extended some sixty miles west of the Mississippi river.  Fairfield was the extreme western County town, bordering on the Indian territory and but a short distance from the Sac and Fox Agency.","ee726d599e136d289974faf1fc6b236d.jpg"],[58308,"6\nNow called \"Agency City\" this agency for the \"Sac\" and \"Fox\" nation was established by Genl J.W. Street, his son-in-law \"Buck\" was in charge of the Indian Agency and was the acting Indian Agent of this tribe of Indians in 1840.  Joseph Smart and John Goodell were regular employed by the Government as Interpretors for this band of Indians.  Each of them was living with a Squaw Wife and had so lived for some years and from that fact became very familiar with the Indian dialect.  When the United States Government was makeing there annual payment to the SAC and Fox tribes at the Agency in the fall of 1841, my curiosity was so great that I mounted my horse and went up to see the manner in which the Indians received their annuitys.","6038e4bc145732bc440ac6a9ae5397d2.jpg"],[58309,"7\nWhile there I engaged my services to J.P. Eddy, Indian trader, as clerk in his tradeing house in the Fox village on the Desmoines river, now called Eddyville.  There was two other young men that had been in his employ for sometime before and could speak the dialect fluently by the name of Wm. Janes and David Mudge and by there assistance I soon done my own interpreting and was quite as well informed in there dialect as my associates.  After spending the winter at the tradeing post, I returned down to Burlington to pay some taxes that was due and spent several days in the city.  Among the young men of whom I was formerly acquainted with and the inquiries were many and great in regard to the Indians.  Just before I left the tradeing post for Burlington in the Spring of 1842, the Indians was","13e73a501b8b55e4ecd5f7fe498400df.jpg"],[58310,"8\nintending to have a grand Buffalo hunt and most of the clerks and traders intended to go along.  Quite a party of young men in Burlington was anxious to take a trip of that kind and see and learn something of the Indian character.  I promising to let them know what time the Indians would start after I got back to my tradeing post.  \nA long in the last of May 1842, the grass was in good condition for their ponys to subsist on.  I notified the Burlington party to be on hands if they wanted to go along a day or two before starting time came.  They was four gentlemen arrived at our store on horseback with a extra pack horse with tent and provisions, armed and equiped for the Buffalo hunt.\nAmong that party, was two lawyers, one merchant and a gentleman of leisure","84a13421dd03d843e411b606edf8475d.jpg"],[58311,"9\nViz John G. Breackenridge, N.T. Huggins atty at law, Dickerson Merchant. Baltzer gentleman of leisure.  All four of the above parties are now dead.  John C. Breakenridge lived to be Vice President of the United States.\nThe starting point for this grand hunt was from the village of Mish-E-Ka-Mah-quet, Chief of the Foxes.  Now called \"Eddyville\".\nOld \"Keokick\" Chief of the \"Sacs\" soon arrived with his tribe from Ottumwa and camped just below the Fox village in close proximity.  So that the two old head chiefs could collect all of there head men and braves together and hold council.  So as to prepare for the hunt.  The village was a live with Indians and great joy seemed to fill them with as much enthusiasm and pleasure as any class of people on Earth","2245393ece20a38caed93138d0badd02.jpg"],[58312,"10\nThey would meet evry evening and have a grand pow wow and war dance.  Hundreds would join in the ring and yell, whoop and sing and go around in the circule in all kind of style, gesticulating, pantomimes, representing characters of birds, wild beast and in fact all kind of animals.  To form this dance one fellow would take his drum out and set down on the ground and begin to sing and hum and beat time until some eight or ten would come and set down and join in the music.  Then you would see the Indians begin to yell and go around the circle for hours at a time keeping the night hideous with the war whoop.\nThe Squaws never join in with the men.  They always dance","3392db6306b9da775e7266a8a7f9e38e.jpg"],[58313,"11\nby themselves and it is called the \"Squaw dance.\"  The men take no part in that dance.  It is quite a novelty to see fifty to a hundred squaws dancing around in a circle one behind the other.  They are equally as musical and interesting as the men.\nAfter two or three days of feasting and fasting, then came the \"Pow-Wow\" or \"big talk\" dancing being over.  Then orders were issued by the head chiefs Keokick and Mish-E-Ka-Mah-quet to be ready to start on the hunt at such a time.\nSo one fine morning early in June 1842 could be seen starting from the village where Eddyville now stands a perfect cavalcade of Indians consisting of men, squaws, pap-poose, dogs, tents, cooking utensils etc all mounted on Indian Ponys.  Starting","04881f4dab4db1a150f79c696fdc9b69.jpg"],[58314,"12\nalong up the banks of the Desmoines river following along the skirt of that river a couple of days and then struck out on the divideing ridge between Desmoines and Skunk rivers and continued between those rivers for a number of days and the hunters would traverse on the different streams and kill all the game that was necessary to live on.  About the time we would be going in to camp of and evening you could see the hunters come straggling in to camp from evry direction with deer, turkeys and other game swung over there horse and makeing for there camp only traveled 10 to 12 miles a day so hunters could hunt.\nThe white men generally pitched there tents off to one side of the main camping ground.  The Burlington party had a tent that just held the four in there party, the provisions that they","1ac6daa86344883ed60f18dc0675e080.jpg"],[58315,"13\nHad laid in so bountifully when they left Burlington was supposed by them to last through the hunt. They had a good supply of sugar, coffee, Boston crackers, hard tack, tea, cheese, pepper, salt and flour and other nicnacks. The pack horse was well ladened. We? the clerks of the post knew, it was not worthwhile to lay in any supplies of that character from the fact that the Indians was such great beggars that it would not last very long and, well knew, if they could not get it by begging, they would watch the opportunity and steal it. They begged considerable from the Burlington party the first day or two, and about the third day stole what was left at night. The next morning they came in to our camp and said that the confounded \"red skins\" had taken all of these provisions and wanted","e6ce1511dfab0963da8be4bfc4a673e1.jpg"],[58316,"14\nto know what they must do about it.  We told them as it was customary with the Indian to steal, they would have to do a we were doing.  Come down to the Indian mode of living and beg it from them as they was very good at divideing with the whites maw, sucatash or dried corn and beans cooked with the game that they chanced to kill through the day.  The clerks that knew the \"Indians\" would go around evry evening to the different camps and whenever were found that they had killed a deer or elk or anything else we would have a divide enough for the white man camps.\nAs we was nearing the head waters of Skunk River, which is located in Hamilton County, we was just far enough out in the western wilds for our tribe of Indians to be carefull","f4edc6fa6eae6931720d5aee3ee51bdf.jpg"],[58317,"15\nand on the lookout for other stragling bands of Sioux Indians.  At about this point our head chiefs and warriors had a regular \"Pow-wow\" or Council evry night and kept a strong picket guard out.  About daylight evry morning, quite a number of scouts would be sent far in advance of our hunting party and they would return in to camp evry night and report to the grand council any discoveries they might chance to make.\nOne evening just after we had gone in to camp, some scouts came in under full headway and evry one was excited to know what was up but the report would not be made to anyone until the Council publicly announced it.  We of course knew that they had discovered signs of the Sioux Indians or Buffalo from the","3e12cf2e22aace2566dcdce8002256ef.jpg"],[58318,"16\nmanner in which they acted in comeing through the camps.  they never halted until they rode up to the Old \"Chiefs\" camp and it was but a short time until the town crier was going through the wick-e-ups calling the head men or braves in to the council.  Then we that understood the language spoken would go in to the council and hear the results of the scouts.\nAnd to our satisfaction we found we was close to the Buffalo. they had discovered a very large drove some fifteen miles beyond in the valley where there was a regular \"Buffalo wallow\".  The scouts were sent back to keep watch of them until the \"Indians\" all came the next day.  That night evryone that had a gun paid particular attention to see that","6ae6fe5da84639f5299fe163c72c67e4.jpg"],[58319,"17\nhe had it in good order for the grand charge that was to be made on the Buffalo the next day.  in the morning the Old Chiefs ordered the town cryer to go through the wickeups and notify evryone that he must not go beyond the foot of a high role that could be seen some fifteen miles off.  As the Buffalo was just over beyond the high rolle and evryone must stop at the foot until the whole party should arrive and then arraingements would be made to give each one an eaqual chance to make the grand charge on the herd of Buffalo and at the same time the white people would be celebrating the 4th day of July 1842 running Buffalo.  We arrived at the above named spot about ten o'clock in the forenoon.  We would crawl up on our hands and knees and peep over in the valley and see thousands of","3c897684c5f24121e5c18803107ccdeb.jpg"],[58320,"18\nBuffalo feeding about two miles off.  First thing done was to pick out a good place to pitch our wigwams and prepare for a few days camping.  By the time that was done our horses got rested and was ready for the chase which was about noon.  In comeing that fifteen miles my horse \"Grey Eagle\" proved he had two much speed and endurance for any of the Indian horses which was a great disappointment to some of them.  The great brave \"Nish-E-Es-Kick,\" son of the noted old warrior \"Black-hawk\" and one other noted brave \"Ne-kote-wee-Nah\".  Those two Indians hunted Buffalo with theire bow and arrows and they were particular friends of mine and they was very fond of a fleet horse.  Before the charge was made on the \"Buffalo\" they was very anxioius to swap horses with me or buy mine but I could not swap.","5782f98d75c876e32adfa7b8757c712c.jpg"],[58321,"19\non such an occassion.  \"Grey Eagle\" had the bottom, and speed, to keep in the lead, while running that fifteen miles.  They was twelve hundred Indian ponys and horses in the race.  The whole party was very restless. about two o'clock the signal was given, and the line formed all along the base of the ridge, which was about two mile in length.\nIn forming the line, the two warriors \"Nish-E-Es-Kick\" and \"Ne-Kote-Wee-Nah.\" Came along and dropped in by my side.  they wanted to see my horse, \"Grey Eagle,\" run.  Each of them had a fox skin swung over his shoulders filled with arrows. and I was anxious to see them use the \"Bow\".  The line being completed and the signal to advance being given it was a beautiful sight, to look along, and see so many on horseback, and the different colored blankets, give it a picturesque sight.  they was the \"Red,\"","485707fc1aff8811073438bfa47ba9b7.jpg"],[58322,"20\nwhite, blue and green.  Waiveing on horseback arriving at the top of the ridge the \"Buffalo\" scented us, and Started fairley making the earth tremble.  the Indians went pell-mell, down amongst them and the crack of the rifle was herd in evry direction. but the sureest and best way of killing was the bow and arrow.  It would not take more than four or five arrows. to bring down a buffalo.  and it was done so quick.  and as soon as he would fall, they would go for another.  we would ride up as close as the herder would go to a \"Buffalo\" about sixty or seventy five feet and it was the most beautiful sight I ever had seen.  to see the arrow, dart in to the side of the Buffalo. almost the full length. and then see the blood. coming poureing over the","4c1675de04f2ca7f192c321dac3b6678.jpg"],[58323,"21\nEnd. and about three of them generally brot him down and he would fall dead and then we would pass on for another. the herd was getting scattered in evry direction. the Indians on the slow \"ponies,\" would stop and prepare the ones shot, for transporting in to camp. In a very short-time the sport ended. and you could cast your eyes over the prairie and see the Buffalo shot, laying in many different directions, in a circle of two or three miles around. and a half a dozen Indians, at each one prepareing him for the camp, the \"Indians\" had a very peculiar idea, about prepareing the Buffalo killed in this manner.  the first-thing done was to tie some red ribbon, in the forehead between the horns, and then circule arround him, shakeing the medicine bag over his head, nd \"Pow-wow-ing\" to the \"Great Spirit.\"","6ae2de55bc612eef7d7b47813f1b8d0f.jpg"],[58324,"22\nand asking the Spirit to not be angry with them for the wholesale slaughter, as it was the only way they could do to keep there people from starveing.  after the pow-wow was gone over the first thing done, was to cut off the tip end of the toung, and then they was satisfied that the Evil-spirit of the Buffalo had departed  you dare not laugh or make sport while they are going through this performance, because they would get very angry with you. they consider it very Sacred with them, and perform the ceremony with the same earnest convictions of a revival class leader, in some of the church gatherings.\nIn a few hours the \"Buffalo\" had disappeared going off towards the \"Neutral Ground\"","dc5896861ee35529e36592e7caa0d167.jpg"],[58325,"23\nbeing near sun down, and about five miles from camp, the little party of white men came together, and dismounted for a rest, and watched the movements of the Indians, Scattered for miles around, in clusters, or small grupes about Each Buffalo, killed, preparing him for the camp. We come to the conclusion that it was a grand sight, that would pay for the trip itsself.  This days sport ended, with the killing of thirty head of Buffalo and all returned back to camp just after sun set, and the loaded horses was taken in charge by the Squaws, and unloaded, then spanceled and turned, loose to graze.  At evry \"wick-E-up\" squaws could be seen activity, prepareing the Buffalo meat in small strips, ready to kiln dry, to preserve it for future use which required several days, after it","45381a1564e77904f0d3dc5fe8b1620c.jpg"],[58326,"was thoroughly dried, it was ground or beat up to a fine powder and then packed in hide pouches for easy transporteing. for Six or Seven days dureing the progress of meat cureing we hunted that portion of country for twenty miles around among the numerous Small Lakes dotted all through the prairies full of fish, Geese, and ducks and plenty of Deer and Elk. \nThe meat being cured and packed away in Sacks, the next move was to follow up the Buffalo that went off in the direction of the \"Neutral Grounds\"which lay in the extreme North Western part of the territory. The \"Neutral Ground\" as it was known by, was a strip of land belonging or controlled by the \"United States which Seperated the different tribes of Indians that was not friendly towards Each Other, and consequently,","a1ef6dac90e8e7496b0b419b7a9d1894.jpg"],[58327,"25\nIt being a famous hunting place and the wild game of all kinds was abundant in and around this strip of \"Neutral Ground\".  The different tribes of Indians was very shy about making much of a stay in that locality, as they was great danger of meeting, hunting partys, of stragling warriors, of some of the different tribes and \"scalping\" or hair lifting, would be the order of the day.\nThe Sioux, Winnebago and SAC and Foxes, generally visited that noted spot for game, and wer very hostile to each other, and many a war party, had previously met on those hunting grounds, and dispatched one another very willingly.\nThe natural consequence was that our Indians, was very cautious, and held consultation or Pow-Wow, evry night with all the chiefs and warriors, of the hunting party, to guard against an attach or surprise of their deadly foe, or Sioux Indians.","c3483f023d2b2153f076f2d9f388d0e6.jpg"],[58328,"26\nthe Scouting party was kept out far in advance, and members of them, would return into camp evry night and report what, if any discoveries was made, of either the enemy or game.\nIn traveling through this vast extent of prairie near the head waters of Skunk river were found a great many stry Buffalo.  Some cows with there calves feeding, around the numerous small lakes dotted all through the prairie.\nIn passing along close by one of the small lakes wee discovered a fine alf about six weeks old standing near the center of a lake, about two hundred and fifty yards in length, and about fifty or sixty in width, the party of white men thought they would have some sport to themselves, and would capture the calf alive.  they was not over forty or fifty Indians close by us","ecc2feb10d39ca6f687ed94f5166e586.jpg"],[58329,"27\nat the time, so wee started after him with the intention of surrounding him, and drawing in on him, he took through the lake, the party came to a halt, wee noticed the Indians yelling and going around either end of the lake.

Baltzer said as he was two heavy to ride fast and did not care to run Buffalo but he would gather in the young game and start a menagerie. they wer tied up at his tent that night, and the white men, seemed to enjoy the little fellows company and seemed anxious to find out, if they was a possibility to get them back to Burlington. It only showed they had no knowledge or conception of the Indian nature or disposition, but when day light come next morning, the annimals had disappeared and no o ne ever knew.  Excepting some two","1493cd4b46508881a5fd894eb5fd86df.jpg"],[58331,"29\nor three mischieveous Indians, they could never sleep and let such a chance to steal go by.  It was amuseing to hear Breakenridge and Baltzer giveing there opinions of the infernal \"Red Skins.\"  Oh If they only had the rascals down to Burlington, they would learn them to steal, but that was a good ways off, so they concluded to let the menagerie business alone.\nWee found excelent sport on this hunting Expedition they was not a day but wee would see droves of Elk, plenty of Deer and Wolves and Scattered Buffalo, the \"Neutral Ground\" afforded plenty of all kinds of game.\nOne night about Eight oclock Several of the Scouts came in to camp with there ponies looking as though they had been run almost to death they","226f122b14c0ed8fbb45a165ac8f0151.jpg"],[58332,"30\ncould scarcely stand for panting and blowing, they had run them about twenty miles.\nIt was but a few moments after their arrival until the \"Town Cryer,\" or as you might say \"Marshall,\" was going through the \"wick-E-up\" notifying the braves, and head warriors to meet for a grand Council.\nIn less than no time you could see the old \"warriors\" going in to the old \"Chiefs\" wig-wam from every direction and as our crowd of whites felt some what interested, three of us that understood the language went in to the Council, to hear the report made by the Scouts, and wee soon learned that the Enemy, the Sioux was in large numbers, and not a great ways off it was more of a war party, than a hunting party, from the fact they had","e178d68787f05b347771d48ad4c6f99f.jpg"],[58333,"31\nno women and children along with them.  after Counciling and speechmakeing for an hour or two, the conclusion came that was to get up and \"puck-a-chee\" in less than no time our whole band of Indians was on the double quick, in a Southwest direction, at sun rise the next morning wee had traveled about thirty miles, and camped on one of the branches of the Desmoines river, and camped two days and hunted that Section of country, and made another down the river twenty-five miles and camped again.

I take the liberty to reply. W.L. CHAPLIN goes. He leaves this city the last of this month, and will be in Washington the 1st of December, when the session commences. Mr. Leavitt, we are informed, does not go; Mr. C. will probably be the only man on whom the Liberty Party can rely for an exposition of the doings of that body.\nShall they make the most of his mission? That they may do so, we have at a great expense and risk enlarged the Patriot, so that in size it surpasses any paper, political or religious, published for any party or any sect in the State of New-York, west of New-York city. This has been done that Mr. C. may have full scope for his observations in its columns, and its readers at the same time be furnished with the doings of the State Legislature, while local and general news, as well as miscellaneous reading, can be also given in abundance, without interfering with its leading object, the advocacy of Liberty Principles. To meet the outlay, and to scatter wide into every district of this State the reports which Mr. C. will make weekly, we want TWO THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS FOR THE SESSION, at a DOLLAR EACH. The session will hold at least seven months, probably longer. Whatever its term be, six months or eight - it will not fall under or go over these - we will take subscribers at a Dollar each, more or less, at one Post-Office - cash invariably in advance.\nLiberty men well know how dark and mysterious to them were the District of Columbia and the Halls of Congress, till Joshua Leavitt first bearded the Slave Power in its den, and seated himself as a Sentinel for Freedom under its terrible gaze. Since that day, how much light and knowledge have come to us! Of all the instrumentalities we have ever used, no one has been more invaluable than that of maintaining a Reporter at Washington. At this time of day, when the conflict thickens, when Freedom lifts her head up cheerily, when Slavery hears the humming of \"the people's voice,\" as it gathers to the rescue of the Constitution and the Country, shall Liberty men, for want of spirit and self-denial, allow to ebb the flood tide which bears to victory those who trust to its bosom? Never! no, never!\nWell, then, my good friend, out of two hundred picked men, you are one of whom we ask the labor and toil of sending us ten subscribers for the session. Will you do it? Will you try? If you try and cannot get ten, get what you can and send them on. Whether one or twenty, the price is a Dollar a copy. But we rely on you for ten copies at least. Come, comrade, brush up your armor, and in the strength and faith of a true heart, devote yourself to this work for a day or two, and send us the results. What you do, should not be delayed. Your list ought to be entered so as to commence with the session, and that is at hand. You can as well do it now as by and by, and a little better.\nOne word more. In your efforts, do not apply to Liberty men alone to subscribe. Try others. You will with much less difficulty than you imagine, obtain men who will take the Patriot. Remember, also, that the Press is to be our lever. By it we must conquer. Let us hear from you soon. Do not delay the application, as the interest will be much increased by commencing with the session.\nRespectfully and truly yours,\nJ. C. JACKSON.\nAlbany, Nov. 20, 1845.","cbc4c1370f7f9fb4910686936ebfd060.jpg"]],"transcount":6,"percentTranscribed":3,"date":[1845,1874],"category":"Family papers; Letters (Correspondence); Women","title":"Robert Everett and Elizabeth Roberts Everett letters [in English and Welsh], 1845-1874"}}}

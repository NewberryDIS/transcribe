This gives one an excuse for writing which you see I am not slow to accept. I thank you for remembering me with the paper. I was much interested in the review of Cousins Eddie's book \"unclear in Verse\" and the sketch of his life.

I met his son Roberts at Oberlin last summer when we were visiting John and Azia and thought him such a fine young man. We had a lovely visit there. Oberlin is a beautiful place.

Had a large audience in \nthe morning, as they wanted to \nhear the \"new minister.\" In the \nevening there was the usual \naudience of about 60.

Feb. 11, 1886\nDear Aunt Mary;-\nIt has been so long since \nwe have heard from you, that I thought I must \nwrite.  How are you prospering this cold winter, \nand what do you find to busy yourself about?\nWe have now been here nearly nine months, \nand have no reason to complain of our treatment\nso far.  I have exchanged six times with different \nministers.  At Crown Point I found a lady, \na member of Mr. Rossiter's church, who was\nstopping there for the summer.  She was the d\ndaughter of Mr. McDougal, I think.  Yesterday\nI had a call from another of your old friends,\nRev. Mr. Jones of Saratoga.  He knew Grandpa\nEverett very well, and has preached in his p\npulpit.  He is a very successful pastor.\nLast Sunday I spent at Hague, where I\nsupplied the first year I was in the seminary.\nThey were glad to see me, and I had a full\nhouse Sunday.  Returned home Monday night. \nI wish you could come and make us a visit.\nWe should be very glad to see you.  At Christmas \ntime we had a tree in the church, and on\nit were about $20. worth of presents for the \npastor and his wife.  We have put $56. worth \nof new books into the S.S. library since we\ncame here.  Next week Wednesday is to be our\ndonation.  They usually raise from $50. to\n$75. then.  I have quite a bad cough now, \nbut got some \"Phos.\" from the doctor here,\nand find it helps it.  We have had it very\ncold, ther. 23 below zero, but it is now\nquite warm, and our sleighing is spoiled.\nHow do you like the work on my type-writer?","c043d480a12f41f8bff5e59aab46e9e7.jpg"],[31531,"It is the Hall, and I got it for about half-\nprice.

Our church has been rather cold \nsome of the time, as the heating arrangements\nare hardly sufficient.  We are holding prayer\nmeetings now around at the houses.  S.S. and\nSunday congregations keep up pretty well.\nThe people have sent in pork, sausage,\nchickens, &c, so as to supply us pretty well \nwith meat during the winter.  They also have\npainted the parsonage.  We have some new \nsinging books which we use in S.S. and prayer-\nmeeting.  I have made me a sled with which to draw\nin wood from the barn to the house.\nI raised plenty of apples, squashes, &c in\nthe garden last summer.

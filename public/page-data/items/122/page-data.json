It is showery today, so that fire feels good. Have only just built it though, 11. A.M. Yesterday was a lovely day & I washed: the first time for me to get the tubs, boiler, wringer and c out.\nHad washed a little [underlined] at a time, before but this time went into is with jest [zest?] & had a good time. Every thing came smoothly & I enjoyed it right well. Left a few","b9231f680d59d9e115a5b86ffe42447d.jpg"],[29540,"things on the grass, as they were not quite dry. Early this morning I heard a little rumbling of thunder & jumped into my clothes pretty quick & ran out & snatched them off the grass. (They had dried in the night) also took in an old carpet that I had washed & put on the grass last Saturday & it was nice & dry.\nYesterday besides washing I took in hand the garret window, puttied it last evening & set it in without fastening [underlined]. thinking that we were to have settled pleasant weather now! and it would do till morning anyway. So throwing down my clean clothes I rushed up stairs. Patter, patter","4d1e1617e07e8df5675ef4ce648edf47.jpg"],[29541,"came the large drops on the roof as I hurried through the garret & drove in a couple of nails as the quickest way to secure the window. The shower was not severe after all. without even wind enough to blow in that window so loosely set in. It rains now very gently with no electrical display here (thought I saw a distant flash as I wrote that.) was probably mistaken. Have turned around & am seated on the hearth with paper on chair. Guess what I had for a wash day dinner yesterday. Fried bacon, onions, egg, Applesauce. & c. cucumbers [underlined] Jane keeps me in cucumbers & chocolate. Do you","8c494c5819b92a4844a68364e39ddf0c.jpg"],[29547,"433 W. 34th St. NY.\nMarch 22, 1889?\nDear Friends,\nThinking you might like to see a bit of Mary's writing I utilize this sheet that I found on the table. She is sleeping on the sofa so I am as good as alone. This is a dreary wet day and she has but a little while ago come in. She brought a large piece of fresh gingerbread and some molasses candy, given her by the family of one of her patients. Last evening she had half a loaf of fresh home made bread and during the week two loaves came from different patients - We have found a bakery very near where we can get a loaf of bread","c0f9d2b476e3c843c5373ab67a381ec7.jpg"],[29548,"a cake of our own making, based for 1 ct a loaf, so we shall do nicely now. We have been baking a loaf once a week at Mrs. Jones'. It will be pleasanter not to trouble her. She is very kind & she often asks for you all by name - and speaks with pleasure of her visit up there.\nI am sorry you sent the butter to D.W. Lewis. Did you not have Ambler's address. The card is I think in the little red-box in the study bureau. Let us know as you progress with the other tub if you wish us to try to see it Will not William be able to get some money from his father soon, now that they are selling spring butter? It must be unpleasant for him to see so short. I wish you Anna had more so that the bills need","839109b0c1b0b53623360b8b35a3243d.jpg"],[29549,"not trouble you, When Eddie begins to collect I hope it will be better if not, we must get some somewhere and pay everybody. Have Laura and Gardine? said a word about paying for that bed? They promised it during the winter, what will have you to pay April 1? Ought I to send John Eddie some to pay his way home?\nI have just written to brother Eddie. Had a letter from him this morning, He speaks well of John Eddie. I am glad he is such a good boy and I hope we will be able give him a good chance again in school. - Mary feels more encouraged about Sarah tho' she does not weigh so much as you! Does she take Phos. Mary thinks that should be taken in water faithfully for her hoarseness. Mary asks does she lose the pitch while singing? Write again","595855a33624de318435bf3a19e9c2c9.jpg"],[29550,"particularly and persevere all of you with oranges. You ought to finish that box and have another before the season is over. Ask Wm?, if they do not save on Kimpey's medicine. How many had you just eaten, Anna, before being weighed? Do they keep nicely.\nWe got a German Student-lamp day before yesterday and find it such a comfort. We had only a side lamp befor and it did not give good light. Our lamp is wicked - large size and is just lovely as graceful & pretty as you please. I would like to know where Sara's hoarseness sticks if it is worse towards evening & mornings, also if in singing she loses the pitch as professional singers do. I am afraid I am spoiling Jennie's good letter but she will not sold. Do you know who wrote this?","eb82a9f118f710972700e8889f16c01f.jpg"],[29608,"230 W. 33d St.\nN.Y. Jan 24/85\nDear Dr;\nYours of Sept. 26 is just rec'd. It seems that it came just as I was coming to N.Y. but before my arrival, by some mistake the book & letter were forwarded to Remsen. The book was returned to me, but the letter, by another mistake was mislaid. A few days since my sister came across it","2acf8df10353d20bb3778a00d9f64378.jpg"],[29609,"unopened among a pile of letters which had been laid aside. I supposed you had not deigned me any notice except to hand my order to the publisher, for which I thank you sincerely.\nIt really seems better to be scolded a little than not to be noticed at all - You say it is ten years since you loaned me the books I hardly realized that it was so long. During those ten years, ten members of our family (all adults but","a124799fe83a1255fc10a9496bf53209.jpg"],[29610,"one) have passed over the river; among them Father, Mother, three sisters & one brother. \nYou said you did not expect to see the books again. There you misjudged me, for one principle was carefully instilled into our minds. & that was to use borrowed articles carefully and return them in as good condition as when received. The keeping of them has troubled me much, but I can add nothing more to my excuse. Are they injured any? I observed","94d357da6020441d6a120dd33bb10ae4.jpg"],[29611,"some blots, but do not know whether they were there when I received them. I am ready to make any reparation in my power, if injury has been done. Have never been able to read them much owing to circumstances already mentioned. Am thankful that the judge of all the earth knows all.\nTrusting that you and family are well & prospering I remain\nYours sincerely\nMary H. Everett","da45eda16154290891d48c64c9551f76.jpg"],[29612,"New York\nApril 24/85\nDear Docter,\nWill you kindly send me the receipt for the eight dollars ($8.00) paid you on Wed. eve, to make up Benefit deficit? As you are usually so prompt in business affairs, I think this must have slipped your mind!\nYours sincerely\nMary H. Everett\nTreas.","c6b07ef0dae41bd0c6cb2086ae4b6175.jpg"],[29618,"Remsen N.Y. July 11, 1906\nMy Dear Niece;\nI was so very thankful for your letter and Roberts; which came more than a week ago! and they have been in my mind ever since, though my letter-writing faculties have seemed to be on the wane of late, cards being more in evidence. I hope you had my card, acknowledging your letters, also my letter sent to the General Office before yours came to me. I hope you are comfortably settled by this time, and that you have been able to get help with the washing & c. How is it with the colored woman who used to help you in that line? It is such a help to have a lift with the heavier jobs. It seems good to think of you being all together, that is all but the Father of the family, who must be \"all alonesome\" as Eva (now Elizabeth) used to say. Out in that Western region, but if we all try to make the best of it \"all things will work together for good.\" in the end. It is such a comfort to know that Our Father knows it all and he sympathizes with us and can help us through. Does Howard continue his reporting on the Journal,","00278098d76e5d58e07d672350641e9c.jpg"],[29619,"(2.)\nand does he still enjoy it? Did the job as Timekeeper on Railroad fall through, or is it still in prospect? I think Howard shows commendable energy in seeking something remunerative to do, does he not? How did Zaidee succeed in Eureka? Do her eyes trouble her still? Is she stronger than when in College & is she at home now? I must reply to Roberts' letter soon, if not in this. He is a nice correspondent. Is not this Margaret's birthday? 8 years old. I can hardly realize that she is such a big girl. Four years ago today we came to this house. I think it was the 11th & not the 10th. The rose bushes in front of the house were in bloom then, and they did look so pretty, and cheering. One bush, the dark red one, nearest the parlor windows, to the left of the path, has been in bloom over a week & is now fading; the one opposite, on the right of the unclear, with pink roses, is just showing how pretty it can be, but will not bloom so freely as the dark red one. The two near the sidewalk, are smaller and will hardly give us a rose this year. They are lighter, one almost white. They were not so well covered last winter with the warm white mantle  as were those nearer the house, and so do not thrive so well this summer.","75af3a57c292277ec5e523381cb322af.jpg"],[29620,"(3.)\nI do not know what to advise as to buying a house in Topeka. There are a good many things to consider. It would be very nice to have the amount paid for rent go towards securing a home. especially if there were probability that you could remain to educate the children, and if it would be all clear gain. How are the taxes in Topeka. Brother John's were very high. But perhaps ministers are not taxed. They are not here. Father was exempt, but as soon as he was gone, Mother was assessed. It seemed hard in her old age and bereavement, but such was the law. Does one become responsible for taxes as soon as the first payment is made? Then repairs are to be considered. In buying a house one wants to be sure that much of that would not be called for right away. We had to commence shingling the first day after entering, and the expense of repairing has been very great. If you buy, look sharp to the condition of the premises. Is the cellar damp or dry? How is the roof? Are the rooms in such shape as to be convenient, and as you wish to have them remain? Is the location convenient to the schools, so that car fares would be at a minimum? I think","f59fa8feda546389e5d91f2907446953.jpg"],[29621,"(4.)\nyou are convenient to Mr. Sheldon's church, where you are now. Is it not nice to be in the same block as you were, and near old acquaintances and friends? Much less lonely than if you were in an entirely different part of the city. Your rent, it seems is two dollars more than, in the other house. Is it a larger house and more convenient? Is there any garden? and did those that were there before you, leaving anything growing for you? When we came here we had a few potatoes, peas, beets, raspberries & c ready for us, and as the man said, he could not take his garden with him! I have not written to discourage you at all, but to give you the benefit of my experience and observations. Must leave my letter to Roberts for another time, with my love to him, to the little 8 year old girl, and you all. I was 8 years old when we first came to Steuben.\nFarewell, farewell, please write soon to your loving\nAunt Mary.\nYour rent does not seem high for a city.","8a5040b8a0c69d2d13d641ee44a64aca.jpg"],[29631,"South Hadley, Feb 25\nMy dear Ellen;\nI cannot tell you how much I was pleased to receive a letter from you.

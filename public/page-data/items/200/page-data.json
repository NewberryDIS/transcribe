Prophecy every where seems to indicate that the time of the Messiah's kingdom would be marked by great instability - owing partly to the increase of spiritual light it would bring, and partly to the opposition it would arouse. And the facts in the case seem to fulfill the prophecy. The rapid changes - diversity of sentiment - superstitious confusion - Spiritualistic vaguery - unhinging of Creeds Convulsions in the moral, spiritual and political worlds - in a word the universal unrest indicates that we are in the midst of the Messiahs \"times\". His kingdom is launched amid Shifting scenes - and the greatÂ ? is What is it that is to act as","ec56905ffdc5dc03e62698f19932bb2c.jpg"],[45151,"its fortifying power or strength of salvation? What is it that is prescribed as sufficient to protect it from the specious power of false theories? We are told that wisdom and knowledge are to do this important work\". That is, intelligence and learning are essential factors which are to enter into the permanency of Messianic institutions and so to preserve the former of truth is subduing the world to Christ.\nIt is sometimes asserted that the Bible disparages education. This, certainly is nowhere expressed. If the Bible had been written in the 19th Century it could not have better indicated the modern Estimate put upon the importance of mutual discipline and learning. It speaks against false science and false philosophy but every where encourages and stimulates the search after truth. All kinds of truth are inter-related and all belong to God. He does not array one","cbbd5770641638d00b93f70befd0a418.jpg"],[45152,"truth against another. He only puts each class in its proper place - Religious truth comes first - then afterwards Science.. \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God\" and then add other things - Religious truth - or the \"fear of the Lord- is the beginning of wisdom\" - not the end of it. The apostle Peter says \"Besides all this, giving all diligence, add to your faith, virtue, that is, \"Conform your life to your convictions\" - that is virtue. and next to this add knowledge - the knowledge of God in all departments of truth. Real knowledge consists in ascertaining the thoughts of God. The facts of Chemistry, of Astronomy, and of all Sciences are just as much the thoughts of God as the facts of Sin, of death or of redemption. The Bible does not pretend to cover all this ground - it only starts us on the road. To know God in His spiritual nature - His will - His","7e533f7eb421b79532e2b7f4324e1d64.jpg"],[45153,"holiness, His justice - His love - This is the key to all other truth.\nPresident Robinson, of Brown University, has recently said that the unclear of the Bible as a book is that though it ranges over a period of 18 centuries and though shadows of divers civilisations rest on its pages, as of Egypt and Babylon, and later of Greece and Rome - all contributing to it, yet notwithstanding this the writers of the Bible never turned from their object which was to bring men back to God and reveal God to man. This being accomplished a truth was unlocked to man which he could use in securing all other necessary knowledge. Thus the Bible is the beginning of necessary knowledge but not the End of it.\nThe history of religious thought is another proof that the Bible is favorable to learning. \"All the great institutions of learning up to the present day have had their origin in Christianity. The church has been the","181b8fa7bd1d8a76182510fda90d8169.jpg"],[45154,"founder of schools, colleges, and Universities. The genius of the gospel is to stimulate to all forms of discovery. When the Bible was locked up in Romish Cloisters the\nworld went into the dark ages.\" When Protestantism rescued it, its light full.\nThe relation of Baptists to the Education of the prudence in the South.\nThis will appear the more plainly if we consider first. Some general principles.","e27157b42237a16674d5185fa1f8c0f5.jpg"],[45155,"founder of schools, colleges, and Universities. The genuis of the gospel is to stimulate to all forms of discovery. When the Bible was locked up in Romish Cloisters the\nworld went into the dark ages.\" When Protestantism rescued it, its light fell upon the world like the rising of the Sun at midnight. The Bible then is not averse to Education. Religion and learning go hand in hand. They are Essentially one. A true Education covers both. Any acquaintance with God in his spiritual nature and in his works constitutes the \"Wisdom and knowledge\" which are prescribed to render stable the church of God.\nAnd here let it be observed that the truth of this scripture statement is confirmed in a Signal manner by the Element of permanence in the institutions of learning themselves. Humanly speaking no institutions of the world live like schools of higher learning. The colleges of Oxford and Cambridge have outlined the dynasties of Tudors and Stuarts. The Monarchy might perish forever, and these would flourish in immortal youth. Harvard and Yale, and Brown and Columbia, and Nassan Hall, and the University of Pennsylvania survived the Revolution, and Southern Colleges are the first to come forth from the Calamities of the Rebellion.\nSuch facts are suggestive and lead to the inquiry which we shall consider this morning. Whether or not the permanence and officiency of a Christian denomination is largely conditioned upon the Educational facilities which it affords.","5aef8e24273423ddb8e4090cadb0900a.jpg"],[45156,"1. In the solution of this question we bring the fact of the rapid growth of general intelligence. There is no ultimate standard of knowledge in this world. \"Many are running to and fro and knowledge is being increased.\" The denomination that does not grow with the ever increasing intelligence of the age will very soon lose its power, and go out of Existence. The Education of Ministers is not enough. Mind must meet mind among the masses. Another recent utterance of one of our greatest religious teachers of this age is in joint. We may say what we will of the power of ore faith and piety in Every age, but cultivated intellect has always had an advantage over uncultivated. Diciplined mind asks no favors in the defence of its positions, and it has always been found that cultivated minds attract cultivated minds, and, in the End, sway and lead the uncultivated. In all communities civilisations","b2ff2fb41ac02ed7245fcb32ddbc5b65.jpg"],[45157,"and religion alike receive their shaping and type from the cultivated. All great movements are eventually carried forward, by Educated men. There may be sudden Ebullitions and initial movements of highest significance which have their own origin with the ignorant and unlearned, but the organising powers whether in politics, religion, or science; the organising powers, that give them form and controlling Energy are always the cultivated minds that are attracted to them. These command attention and respect. Men take a new paper regardless of the doctrinal or religious belief of the Editor. It has been said that men will have the latest and most authentic news of unclear go to the mouth of hell for it. If you have an Enlightened and vigorous newspaper Edited by an Educated demon, and","d5a32fde3738c50d90452d8302ca6903.jpg"],[45158,"issued out of the gate of perdition, and an unenlightened and meakly one edited by an ignorant saint, and issued out of the gate of heaven, men will take the former and despise the latter. The same principle holds good in religious matters. The society or Church which does not give heed to these facts, may effect to lose it efficiency.\nIntelligent Conviction is the product of the schools. Not only is deep conviction of truth held necessary but intelligent conviction. Not only Earnestness but enlightenment, not only zeal but knowledge. What is bigotry but strong conviction without the basis of knowledge. What is superstition but a theory unsupported by facts, what is a fanaticism but great earnestness in the absence of enlightenment. All these are brighting in them, reactionary influences. In this day of advanced culture and thought men weigh theories not in the scale of","3ae4699b2844915de9d9a63fb0ff4091.jpg"],[45159,"sincerely and zeal but in the balances of real knowledge. A man is not right because he is earnest. There may be great power exented for a time by a denomination which depends upon the furver which it excites, but it is as apt to be zealous in the wrong as in the truth and it will come finally to lose its hold upon the thought of the age and digenerate to the unthinking and illiterate. \n3 The purity of a denomination depends largely upon the fortifying power of Education.\n\"Mental cultivation is not sanctification but it is a condition favorable to it. The Christian lad who loves his book will not be so anxious for the society of boys on the street. The laboring man who has become interested in reading and thinking will not need to seek entertainment around public corners and hotel steps.","4733303d2261a3dea7d727dc495e325b.jpg"],[45160,"If the Education of the people is favorable to the purity of the Church, who does not believe that purity is power. Make any denomination free from corruption and you enhance its power accordingly and that this is the tendency of a true education no one will gainsay.\n4 Again, the increasing potency of false doctrines demands increasing facilities for scholarship. No one who is careful in observing the signs of the times can fail to discover the attempt to amass the weight of scholarship on the side of infidelity. The opposers of religion grow bold when they can point to a scholar who says that the facts of science contradict the Bible. That will be a sad end in the history of the world when it becomes universally acknowledged that scholarship stands against the Christian religion. What then shall be done? Laugh at the infidel? That will show your weakness","5a760efe1bf1445697caf7389023f3af.jpg"],[45161,"Tell him that your religion is a matter of faith and not of knowledge? That would be to admit a falsehood. Religion is based upon fact as well as faith, and no fact of nature can stand against the facts of redemption. No, the only consistent way to conquer inifidelity is to meet scholarship with scholarship reasoning with reasoning, culture with culture, logic with logic and literature with literature. Let the christian hold the balance of power. To meet the men who so boldly assert that the facts of science disprove the Biblical account of Creation, raise up an Agassiz or a Hugh Miller to prove that what are claimed as facts are not facts but jumped at conclusions. That what is claimed as science is not science, but only would be science. Against a Stauss and Renan put a host of men like Christlieb. Hovey - Huchett conant. What has given to Unitarianism so much power in this","333300b0e3fe424a0d24edfaa490fd51.jpg"],[45162,"country is the fact that it gained the balance of power in Harvard University and sent out to advocate its poison and fill its pulpits men of culture. And infidelitty once met and conquered does not suffice. Its potency is in its power to change base. It climbs the ladder of learning still higher that it may regain what it has lost. So it has been chased through 18 Centuries and has been defeated each time upon its own ground. It is a simple thing to say that God will take care of his truth and his church. That is but begging the question at issue. We believe indeed that God will care for his truth and that in doing it he will use the means adapted to the End. God will not work a miracle to do what a simple instrummentaly will do without it. So far in the history of his church he has","3c5cb425d893fa46a58b63ec074a10db.jpg"],[45163,"raised up men of talent and learning equal to meet all the poopsers of his truth. The agency which he has blessed in the past we have good reason to believe he will bless in the future. And what is true of the leaders in controversy is true of all. The masses of Christians should be able to meet the masses of unbelievers. Now the denomination that is not equal to this talk must lose in the same proportion its power to win for Christ.\n5 But there are some special reasons why \"the proposition with which we started out is specially true of) Baptists shoiudl fortify. No denomination has had a more rapid growth during the last Century than ours. Our prosperity in numbers and wealth has far exceeded our Educational facilities. We cannot go much farther without fear of loss. Intrenchment is needed. We must Educate as well","b7c5e0779affe1f6a384af909f50a1de.jpg"],[45164,"as Evangelise, teach as well as make disciples, grow internally as well as numerically. Take in texture and strength as well as spread ourselves like the oak.\" In 1776 we had only 25,000 members in our denomination. Today we have over 1,800,000 an increase greater than that of the population of this Country and it is believed greater than that of any other denomination. At the beginning of this Century we were only one twentieth as great as the Congregationalists and now we are five times greater, and our increase during the last year alone is six times the amount of our Entire membership in 1776. We speak of these things not boastingly but only to inspire gratitude. On the other hand we have at present under Baptist direction 10 Theological Sem., 35 Colleges and universities, and 60 academics, in the place of one college &","a77b3668c5413ff49740cc611a27d2f6.jpg"],[45165,"two schools a century ago. The yearly supply of Theological graduates does not exceed 400. The number of preachers on our lists is only about 13,000 with more than 20,000 Churches to supply. Here is a sad deficiency. A century ago it might be met by uneducated men to day it cannot. Men will not preach without an Education and churches would not hear them if they would. The fact is, we are fast out growing our facilities to educate and equip.\nLet it be understood, however, that we are not lacking in representative scholars. It has been recently affirmed by one of our foremost Educators that, it is admitted by all real scholars that Biblical learning and the higher Biblical criticism is altogether on our side. That two if not three of the foremost Biblical scholars in this country are Baptists. That it is admitted by all real Bible scholars of both Europe and America","6fe52927e848c5685954d3d63078efdc.jpg"],[45166,"that our mode of baptism was the primitive one and that there was no infant baptism in the primitive church that the first Christians received baptism only on profession of personal faith in X, and that there are no traces of Either Episcopacy or Papacy in the New Testament. These are the facts in the Case. They are not disputed by impartial Scholars. We can summon for our support, therefore, the Biblical learning of the World. But the simple fact that we have this advantage today does not assure us of it for all time. Truth will remain the same to all Eternity but the ability to maintain it may be lost through neglect our ability will depend upon our thoroughness of Education.","05745b02e8ce99cccca843af35e705d7.jpg"],[45167,"6 Another special reason why Baptists should fortify by Education is because of the advanced doctrinal position which they hold.\nThey are, as they have ever been, pioneers in the field of doctrine. \"Searching for new truth as well as treasuring the old, and hence like all leaders of opinion become the speckled bird which all the birds pick at. Catholics and Protestants alike are constantly at issue with them.\" Fort the doctrines of soul, liberty, the independency of Church government, the immersion of believers only, and restricted communion, we have been hunted & persecuted at one time or another as though we were wild beasts. Nor is the time of persecution passed by. The thumb screw and whipping post have faded away in the distance, But other methods of proscription are in use which require a greater heroism","5c786b450333e2ee06a9329458826847.jpg"],[45168,"to endure than Even they. Denunsiative and cowardly caricature are used instead.\nOur peculiar form of Church government which Emphasises and hence Exposes the individual so much renders it necessary to fortify by the diffusion of culture. Republics find it necessary in order to permanence and safety to diffuse to the greatest possible degree intelligence and morality, otherwise they would degenerate into general anarchy. A Republican government can Exist only in an Enlightened country. Hence the Education of the masses is so strongly insisted on in our land. So the Baptist denomination requires the same safeguards. The anarchy here and confusion which crops out here and there in our churches is mostly the result of narrow and undisciplined minds. In giving all the people a voice in church affairs we have","f4e20fa62588a9ba36e49946d43570a1.jpg"],[45169,"put ourselves under the unclear heaviest bonds to see that they have an Education also.\nTaking this things in to account holding. To primitive truth, which others ignore,\nand the independency of our church government. There is no other denomination of Christians on Earth that have a great need of a thorough sholarship among the membership, as a fortifying power as the Baptist denomination.\n\n7 And another thought that naturally follows is this, the competitive influences o other denominations require us to Educate. The denomination that educates most thoroughly, other things being Equal, will wield the greatest power in a community. Things go by reputation. A great point is gained where a man achieves the reputation of being scholarly. So with a denomination, the church society that moves most in the Circles of the Educated and Cultured may expect to Exent the greatest power in drawing this class to its fold.","6094765c36a454f5e305b9fdc625b2e4.jpg"],[45170,"Nothing else will compensate for it. \"Birds of a feather will flock together.\" On the other hand let a christian society take no notice of the higher class of monuments where cultured people operate refuse to spend their time on money to further its interests, may well wonder and ought to be astonished that so few cultured and wealthy persons are received into its Communion. The greater the number of Educated persons a denomination furnishes for positions of public trust and honor the greater will be its prestige and power. The friends of such men, respecting them for their mental attainments will be more ready to accept their opinions on religious matters. Holding the doctrines we do as Baptists and especially insisting upon them as we do, we should aim to prepare our men and see that they fill offices of honor and trust. School","b689f3a83d55a84b4496b5bb9e949b07.jpg"],[45171,"Boards, Professorships, Editorial offices, high places in the legal and medical professions, and legislative halls are open to the best men, and should be occupied by Christian men. \"We want more Josephs and Daniels in the land.\" The Baptist denomination should at least be wide awake enough to furnish its full share of such men, if it does not it will suffer. A scotchman was asked why so many scotch lawyers, physicians, and other scholars came to London and other cities outside their own land. Said he \"Auld Scotland raises so much brain she can afford to Export.\" So there is no good reason why we should not train up scholarly young men enough not only to fill positions of trust in our own denomination, but when demands are made for Educated men in Secular positions or in other denominations they might be found in abundance in Baptist Circles.","27d679ef2d3a8f2093e02dd3c0546532.jpg"],[45172,"Other Christians denominations are wide awake upon this subject, their veins have been set forth even with greater Emphasis from their standpoints than we have Expressed ours today. Their institutions of learning are regareded as the bulwark of their faith. With keen foresight into the future they have discovered the great condition of their permanent success, and have accordingly set about the work of planting self sustaining institutions of learning all over our land. But a few years ago our Methodist and Presbyterian brethren made a centeinnial offering to their schools of nearly 8 millions of dollars each. That was grand. We commend them for it. Give to them our youth to educate and what would be the result? and what ought to be the result? If they Educate our children we ought not to grumble if our Children turn into their fold. And then what?","35bced7ab518b935977607c0ed877a18.jpg"],[45173,"The weakening and decay of what we believe to be the New Testament Church and then what? The wanton betrayal of our trust, the truth as it was delivered to the Saints. And then what? The judgement will answer. X\nIt would be needless to go into a discussion here as to the necessity of Schools of higher learning as they are called in distinction from common schools on high Schools. It must be easily inferred from what has already been said that the Common schools alone would by no means meet the demands of the case. No more than the strength and wisdom of the lad are equal to the demands of mature life. Common schools are to colleges what the primary grade is to the high school. They may have answered once but they will not grow. To do away with colleges and universities would reverse the wheel of civilisation for more than a century. Standards of Scholarship, new discoveries, triumphs, over false theories, and the formulating of new ones, together with theological training all have their place","dbcbe54509128ee82b89d526e45a36fc.jpg"],[45174,"in schools of higher learning. The more important question is are denominational schools a necessity? The answer to this lies in part in the fact that the very large majority of all the higher Schools of learning are under some denominational control. The experience of Christian teachers in our state Universities is to the End that the influence of Such schools upon the Christian Character is not the most favorable. The purely and distinctively secular character of the school is exalted out of its place. \"It is good for a young man to know that learning and mental development are not all that he needs. Learning must hold a high place in the regard of Every Student but when it takes the highest place it is a usurper, and needs to be dethroned. One of the tendencies in a college Endorned in the interests of learning and religion","c8d600c7ac977431c3f19c9a4a5a4a49.jpg"],[45175,"=A gray elder of the pioneer times was once addressing a graduating class. \"My young brethren,\" said he, \"learning is good and I am glad that you have it. Latin is good, and so is Greek and Hebrew; only, brethren take care and not put them where the Jews put them - over the head of Jesus.\" With this precaution we need not fear that human culture can do too much in the service of our Lord and his Christ.\"\ncombined is to keep learning in its true place as subordinate to religion And this is never to the disadvantage of learning in the End. Out of its right place it becomes distorted *It is good for the student to be constantly impressed with the truth that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom. That his highest allegiance is to duty and to God. Denominational schools are the only ones that can be relied on to produce this result. Again it is mostly from these schools that we receive our additions to the ministry. The majority of students decide upon the profession they will follow after Entering college. The atmosphere surrounding them their determines their choice. If that is purely Secular a sicular calling is most apt to be the choice. A writer suffering to the influence \"of the institution of Hamilton new York says. Can you tell me how much of the growth and prosperity of the churches in New York and all the west have defended","9c20509e8830d38d23cfc32576530e9c.jpg"],[45176,"on the labors of the men who chose the ministry through its influence?

That they were wise is the verdict of history which no man can dispute. And what is true of the Baptists of New York is true of the Baptists of all New England. Their growth and prosperity has depended essentially on the schools at Providence. Waterville Newton Hamilton and Rochester.\nBesides it were enough to say that all denominations agree in this and so are at work Establishing and Endowing their schools. And shall we be behind? The history of crossing denominational lives is this.

And just so they talk with reference to us, and justly too, for observation confirms the vein.\nBut one other thought and we will close the subject. It is a query with some why these schools are not self sustaining already, and why so great a demand should be made to further Endow them. The query is very Easily answered. In the first place the most of these schools are in debt, the current income not being equal to the Expenses. In the next place it costs a great deal of money to build and equip an institution of learning. At the national Baptist Educational Convention held in 1870 estimates were made of the cost and Equipment","6772e09a4f7fac2ab0e66401db3d4ea4.jpg"],[45178,"of an academy and an average College, or seek an academy and College as are needed in these times. The figures were as follows. For an Academy, its buildings, grounds. The beginning of its library, and the beginning of its aparatis it would require $50,000. Then $50,000 more should be added from which an income might be received to pay the salaries of teachers, reserving the income from students for necessary repairs and improvement.\nIn the case of a College, its grounds, buildings of moderate architecture, beginning of a scientific collection, library, apparatus, &c must cost not less than $250,000. I am speaking now of a first class College such as the times demand and which the Baptists deserve. The salaries of ten instructors, the incidental Expenses, cost of lectures after deducting a","5bd596c61e4eea7e985357319cbbcf51.jpg"],[45179,"fair sum from the tuition of Students will reach the amount of $830,000 per amum. To cover this amount and keep clear from debt would require an invested Endowment of $400,000 at 7 per ct interest. This would make the complete outfit worth about $650,000. If these figures seem large, they are no larger than the facts demand. The rent condition of our institutions is far different from this representation. Their buildings are incomplete, libraries and apparatus are incomplete, Endowments are incomplete, consequently tuition is high, and teachers are poorly paid. (Close)\n\"It is then no untimely or unnecessary project which is now being put into operation. That the Baptist denomination should signalise the closing of the Century by a general effort to place these institutions on a sufficient and secure basis for the future.

The Sabbath\ncomes with a mass of other related questions\nnow being pressed upon us from infidel\nquarters, and must be Solved by the\nChristian public upon their appeal to \nthe word of God, and the requirements of \nhuman Nature. That we may share\nthis responsibility understandingly, let\nus take a comprehensive view of the\nsubject.\nI And, first, let us glance at the history\nof the Sabbath.\nThis is naturally divided into three periods.\nThe first is the pre-Mosaic period. This began\nin Eden. God gave to the race at its very\nbeginning two great institutions, Marriage\nand the Sabbath. The first was the foundation of the\nSocial relations among men, and the second\nwas designed to regulate these relations as to \nperiods of labor, rest, and worship.\nThe first mention we have of the Sabbath is found\nin Gen. 2. Chap. Thus the heavens and the\nEarth were finished, and all the host of them,","947611866a6320e60e1ec506211b4b95.jpg"],[45245,"3\nAnd on the 7th day God Ended his work\nwhich He had made. And he rested on the 7th\nday from all his work wh. he had made.\nAnd God blessed the 7th day and Sanctified it,\nbecause that in it he had rested from all\nhis work wh. God created and made.\nThis passage closes up the account of Creation\nand follows immediately upon the account\nof mans introduction into the world. The Sab.\nmust therefore have been designed for man in its\ngeneric sense. It could not have been given to one\nparticular tribe or class more than another.\nIt belonged to the whole race, Through Every age\n& in every cline. For Man God Sanctified\nit, or set it apart from a Common to a\nsacred use. And the reason he gives is that\nhe himself rested on the 7th day from all\nhis work! Here is Gods example giving before\nthe race giving to his requirement the highest\npossible degree of Significance. It was an\nExact prototype of that of Christ when he stood","7879fda5c8727329cb78c910d3d6a552.jpg"],[45246,"4.\nbefore John the Baptiser on the Banks of the\nJordan and said; \"This it becometh us\nto fulfill all righteousness.\" Six days of work\nand one of rest was the proportion of time\nfor secular and Sacred Employments fixed\nso long as time should Exist. The patriarchs\nseem to have adhered Strictly to this order.\nWe read, however, not so much of the Sab.\nas we do of the seventh division of time\nfor sacred purposes. A few instances will\nillustrate this, as well as to show that the Sab\nin reality was observed by them. In the\naccount given of Cain and Abel there occurs\nthis passage; \"In process of time it came\nto pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the\nground an offering to the Lord.\" The Expression\n\"In process of time\" is more correctly translated\nin the margin, as \"at the end of days, or\n\"at the cutting off of days.\" Thay marked a division of time. Now, that this refers\nto the Sabbath is inferred from the fact that\nwe have no account of any other division\nof time having been introduced, and that\nit is a very natural expression to indicate","0e72d9f76e7767cc1681ce339fc0af7b.jpg"],[45247,"5.\nthe end of a week. Besides, as the Lord had\nset apart the 7th as the only day for worship\nwe must conclude that these two brothers bro't \ntheir offerings for that purpose on that\nday. The same division of time was observed\nalso by Noah, both before Entering into\nthe ark and while he was confined there.\nThe Israelites, after leaving Egypt, but before\nreaching Sinai, seem to have observed the\nsame arrangement. God was about\nto supply their hunger with manna. He speaks\nof the Sab. as though its observance was a\nthing familiar to them, and instructs them\nto gather twice as much manna on the 6th\nas on any other day. Thus providing for\nthe Sab. They were also reproved for not\nhelping it as though they ought to have\nunderstood it as a command. But the\nHebrews were evidently not the only keepers\nof the Sab. in Early times. There are authentic\nrecords among the classics & everywhere\nwhich go to prove that the observance","dba6b3257e9970193a59ce4db52e0c8b.jpg"],[45248,"6.\nof a 7th day was practiced among the\nGreeks and Romans and the northern\nnatives of Europe, for purposes more or less\nreligious. And these traces go so far back\nas to make it Evident that their 7th day was\na relic or a perversion of the paradisiacal\nSab. These Statements are sufficient at\nleast to prove that there was a pre-Mosaic Sab.\nand if so, then the Sab. was originally\ndesigned to be universal and cannot\nbe abrogated on the plea that it was only\ngiven to the Jews, and therefore was local\nand temporary.\nThe Second period or Mosaic Sabbath began\nwith the giving of the law on Sinai. This\nwas not a new Sabbath. It was the recognition \nand insertion of the original Sabbath among the\nten more precepts which Christ, and all\nthe world, have regarded as of perpetual\nand universal obligation. The very wording\nof the Command \"Remember the Sab. day\nto keep it holy indicated its previous","99a834355dd4f07f644d8190fa2296c2.jpg"],[45249,"7.\nHow can we remember a thing wh near had an existence\ninstitution. It was now taken up and\nenforced men, not only with the same\nreasons given, that God rested one nat day, but with new motives, and\nwith added rites, according to the Circumstances\nof the Israelites as Gods chosen people. It\nis said that the Mosaic Sab. is only a Ceremonial\nlaw and binding only upon the\nJews. \nBut the Sab. is no more Ceremonial in its \nEssential nature than is any other of the ten\nCommandments. It existed in principle as\na moral precept from the beginning of the\nrace. All there is of a local or temporary\ncharacter about any of them is the Super added\nrites, and penalties for their non-observance.\nFor instance, God set the Sab. as a particular\nsign to distinguish the Jews from the idolatrous\nnations surrounding them, and as a memorial\nfor their deliverance from bondage,\nand as a penalty he made its violation","5c4d2fa15aec6be35eb6ab7e3570d60b.jpg"],[45250,"8.\npunishable with death. The same punishment precisely\nwas attached to adultery, and murder,\nand each violation of the decalogue had its penalty. But\nthese specific features of those 10 laws passed\naway when the Jewish nation ceased to be.\nNot so, however, with the obligation to observe\nthe precepts underlying these outer Signs.\nThe obligation to keep the Sab. and the law\nof Chastity will remain alike sacred as long as\nthe world stands. \"Ceremonies may find\ntheir fulfillment, Nations may perish, languages\nmay become dead letters, the moral\nand social worlds be turned upside down\nyet will these 10 laws of equal weight in\nGods balance, written with Gods finger\non tablets of Stone amid tokens of light\nand judgment remain indellibly fixed\nas Gods stand and for man to live by.\"\nBut the mere idea of rest from toil was\nbut a small part of the required Sab. observance.\nGod blessed and Sanctified the\nday. Nothing Else can be made of this but\nthat it was to be remembered as a holy day","ee635b6e439d402dbb8b8742aa7664c6.jpg"],[45251,"9.\na day of holy convocation\" as the Jews called\nit. They interpreted it to mean a day\nfor the worship of God, for the reading of\nthe Scriptures, for the instruction of families\nand for holy Meditation. And this custom\nwas unvarying with the Jews, except during the Exiles\nuntil Christ came \"who also as his\ncustom was went into the Synagogue on\nthe Sab. day and stood up to read. His\ninstructions to his disciples also indicated\nthe mode in which it was to be afterward\nkept by specifying what things it was\nlawful to do on Sab. days and what\nit was not lawful to do. So that\nworship as the prime idea was connected\nwith the Sab. from Adam to Moses\nfrom Moses to Christ and through him\nis linked to the Christian dispensation.\nThe Christian Sab. is New in its nature\nthe same as the Mosaic Sab. The main","10cde32acf4ff055938cac3bdac257f5.jpg"],[45252,"10.\ndifferences being, first, that all that\nwas peculiar to the Jews as a separate people\nwith their shadows of good things to come\nhave passed away and we have\na purer Sabbath and a purer worship\nEven as the Spirit is better than the letter.\nThe second change is in the day on\nwhich it occurs. It is not claimed\nby any one to my knowledge that there\nis any Expressed Scripture command for the\nkeeping of the first day of the week as the Sab.\nNor is there need of any authority command more than we\nhave. The example of Christ and his\nApostles and after them the Early disciples\nwho, with isolated exceptions, kept only\nthe first day is sufficient authority for\nany who are not determined to ride a\nhobby. There is no evidence addressed\nyet to show that if the world were in the\nhands of the 7th day advocates the Millenium\nwould come any the sooner. Nor is there\nany potency in the argument, that if all\nChristians kept the 7th day the \"world would","743ed4461c0e24cdbc7aad1dd2c6a611.jpg"],[45253,"11.\nkeep it too.\" Besides, there is no clear Scripture\nauthority for the 7th day view of the Sab.\nas the Christians Sab. The 4th commandment \ndoes not say to remember the Seventh day,\nbut the Sab. day. Now the \"Sabbath\" does not\nmean 7, it means rest. And if in Gods\nprovidence, he should change this rest \nday from the original 7th to the 1st, 4th,\nor 5th it would yet be the Sabbath\nand would not invalidate the force of\nthe command to remember it, in the least,\ninasmuch as he is Lord also of the Sab.\nBut this is just what the Scriptures indicate\nthat God has done in changing it from\nthe 7th day to the 1st. Christ was as much\nLord of the Old T. as he is of the New and\nvice versa. It was Christ who stood forth\nin the morning of creation and spoke\nworlds into being, who talked with Adam\nin Eden and with Moses on the Mount.\nand who was meant when the prophets","15a54e6d3a148486f1235161a5c8815a.jpg"],[45254,"12.\nof old stood up before the people with their\nMessage prefaced by tokens of Authority,\n\"O Israel, Hear the word of the Lord\", \"For in\nthe beginning was the word and the word\nwas with God and the word was God.\nAll things were made by him and without\nhim was not anything made that was\nmade. He must then have made the Sabbath.\nIf it was he who rested from\nhis work of creation on the 7th day and\nblessed it, need it surprise us, or lead\nus to vain questioning, if, when he finishes\nhis new creation by his resurrection from\nthe dead he rests upon that day and\nhallows it? And did he not sanctify it?\nRead Hebrews 4:9, carefully. There remaineth\ntherefore a rest to the people of\nGod. The word rest is the original word for Sab.\nFor he that is entered into his rest (Sab) He also\nhath ceased from his own works as God\ndid from his. The argument here is plain\nand conclusive. As God had a Sabbath\nafter finishing his work of Creation. So\nChrist as mediator, had a Sabbath following the completion","92084c6554c63c8568b20b895c52c5a7.jpg"],[45255,"13.\nof his redemptive work. The change of dispensation\ndid not obliterate the Sabbath but changed the day.\nThere remaineth therefore a Sab. to the people\nof God, and it will continue \nuntil the type is lost in the heavenly\nand eternal rest. But Christ's rest day was the 1st instead of the 7th\nAnd should we have\neven a third dispensation and the work\nof that should cease any other day and\nanother Sabbath be instituted neither would\nthat at all abrogate or modify the command\nRemember the Sabbath day to keep \nit holy. But, here, let us notice for the\nsake of clearing away all possible doubts,\nthe fact that the Jewish Christians who seemed\nto find it hard work to give up Moses\nat first kept the 7th day as well as the 1st,\nand this instance is by the 7th day advocates to prove, that the\nfirst day was only a memorial of X's\nresurrection while the 7th day was still to \nbe observed as the Sab. But the Apostles\nseemed to have taught otherwise. In Col. 2:\n16,17 you will find what they say about it.\nThe Colossians were troubled with Judaism","a4020b847ec7edb1bac7f6947b10f351.jpg"],[45256,"14.\nteachers, while professing allegiance to X\nthey held fast also to the minute customs of\nthe law. This involved them in much dissension.\nAmong other questions of difficulty\nwas that of the Sab. Which day should be\nkept, or should they keep both. The Apostle\nPaul in Setting this difficulty declared\nthat the disciples of Jesus were not longer\nunder obligation to keep the Seventh day\nnor any of the old appointed holy days,\n\"Let no man judge you in respect of\"\nthese things. That is, let no one enforce upon\nyour consciences the keeping of those days\nyou are now under law to Christ. And\nthe reason he assigns for that course is\nthat they were the shadow of things to come\nof which Christ was the body or substance.\nIt is plain then, that if the moral precept\nwhich is perpetually binding does not\nspecify the day, only as the rest day,\nand the disciples of Christ were under","63ec93bb10c0183c566a06870cd79399.jpg"],[45257,"15.\nno obligation to keep the 7th after his\nresurrection, and he and his Apostles and\nthe Early Christians kept only the 1st day\nthat the Sabbath of the Christian dispensation\nis the first day of the week.\nII The Christian Sabbath comes down to us\ntherefore vested with all the authority of God.\nRemember the Sab. day to keep it holy refers\nto no other day that that on which we worship.\nWhen God Explicitly says remember it is\npresumption to forget. But aside from\nall expressed teaching upon this point,\nthe Sabbath authenticates itself as coming\nfrom God. Even if men throw away\nthe Bible, as some do, there is clear Evidence\nof the divine origin of the Sab.\nEx Pres. Hopkins of Williams College Says;\nRegarding man as sinful, taking\nhim as we now find him, in Every country\nwhere the Sab. is unknown, the very conception\nof a holy Sabbath would have been\nimpossible.

He could neither\nhave decided rightly the proportion of time\nto be set apart, nor have guarded the\nsanctity of the day by penalties. Man could\nnot have so associated the Sab. with the\ngrandest ideas made known by Rev.\nor possible to thought, as the creation of\nthe world. The resurrection of Christ, the\noutpouring of the Spirit and the rest of a\nholy heaven. He could not have made\nit span the arch from the beginning to \nthe consummation of all things.\nWe need not stay longer upon this\npart, and have dwelt upon it to such\nlength only for the purpose of restating\nand presenting in a fresh form the","59c7c856195a14059a74d969d7c970c4.jpg"],[45259,"17.\ngrounds upon which rest the authority\nand permanence of our Sabbath.\nIII The next step brings us to the great\npurpose of the Sabbath.\nAnd first how does this purpose stand\nrelated to God, or for what, as concerns\nhimself did God ordain the Sab? What\nbenefit does he receive by it? The answer\nis given in the first mention made of\nthe Sab.

In\nother words are we not responsible\nto God for all that makes us different\nfrom what He designed us to be?

And if sin did not involve\nhumiliation, and the acknowledgement\nof guilt, This doctrine, of accountability for belief would \ninstantly be inserted in every mans Creed.\nIV It is attested by divine revelation.\nThe Bible testimony to this subject is\npeculiar, yet emphatic. Responsibility for\nbelief is not in so many words a revealed truth. The Bible\nevery where takes it for granted. It does\nnot undertake to demonstrate fundamental,\nor intuitive truths. It may state but it no where attempts to\nprove moral axious. It does not state \nthat sin is wrong. Every body knows it\nwithout being told. We may not always know that certain\nacts are sinful, but when told\nwe know that they are wrong.\nIt does not prove that love","7efbc7d32816d8c46f8d59da22ff1d7a.jpg"],[45329,"31\nis right. A voice from the inner consciousness\nanswers us of this fact. It is never\nquestioned. These being taken for granted,\nthe Bible exhorts upon them. Responsibility\nfor belief is a moral axiom, which the\nBible has not undertaken to prove. It \nis taken for granted the same as any\nother fact of consciousness. Assuming\nthat every man believes in the existence\nof God it exhorts us to love and obey\nHim. It forewarns us of the fearful \nconsequences of disobedience by assuring\nus that \"God will bring every work\ninto judgement, with every secret thing,\nwhether it be good or whether it be evil.\";\nthat \"Every man shall give account of\nhimself to God.\" Noice the phraseology, \"Every\nwork\", \"Every secret thing\", \"give account of \nhimself\" expressions which including the whole man. Thoughts","d7dbe9154040352e0880b975adcbc73d.jpg"],[45330,"32\nbeliefs, acts. The record of the first sin\nillustrates this responsibility. The question\nwith Adam and Eve was whether they\nshould believe God or Satan. God\nhad said if ye eat of the fruit, ye shall\ndie. Satan said ye shall not surely die.\nThey took the responsibility of believing\nthe latter, and were expelled from Eden.\nSo God has ever treated the race,\nand held it accountable for not believing\nHim. The history of the Jews furnish\nabundant illustrations. When Christ came,\nhe did not begin His work by arguing\nthe question of responsibility for believing\nin Him. He acted upon the basis that they\nknew they were responsible, and had\nsufficient evidence to accept of Him\nas the Messiah, if they would. Yes, if they\nwould.

First, if we are responsible for having a belief at all\nwe are under obligation to have a right\nbelief. The Atheist, Materialist, Pantheist,\nand Rationalist, are not excused\nbecause they do not profess to believe\nin the existence of God, or in the revelation\nof God to man. If they were, then\nwe should have this strange state of\nmoral affairs. Those who believe a\nthing are responsible for it,\nand those who do not believe it are\nnot responsible. \"For what if they do not'.","729ec98b6dbfd47329af8fe7a8df587c.jpg"],[45333,"35\nbelieve, shall their unbelief make the\nfaith of God without effect? God forbid,\nyea, let God be true but every man\na liar.\"\nAnd this obligation extends not only to the\nquestion of salvation, but to all questions\nof christian discipleship. The \"cant\" \nexpression, \"that is matters not what we believe\nif we are only christians,\" meets with\nrebuke, as it ought. Shall the disciple say\nto his Lord, \"I have believed to the saving\nof my soul, and now my responsibility\nis at an end, I may believe in all\nother matters as I please? Is he at \nliberty to investigate evidence of truth\nonly in matters of Salvation and not in\nmatters of Christian life, of church fellowship,\nand of Christian ordinances? Does\nit look well for Christians to hold the","a43a59ec2957e40ccff67ff5f04e795a.jpg"],[45334,"36\nunbeliever to strict account for not believing\nin Christ, and yet ever plead for liberty\namong themselves at the expense of exact\nobedience to Christ's commands? If the\nargument which we have used to\nday applies at all, it applies at his point.\n2. If we are under obligation to have a\nright belief, we are bound to contend\nfor it when it is assailed.\nThere is no logic sounder than this, and\nyet there are plenty of people who will\nnot abide it. They will stand up for\ntheir politics, they will contend for their\nideas of science, they will fight unto\ndeath for principles of government, but\nwhen they come to matters of religion\nthey run like cowards, or stand ever\nready to proclaim a truce.

The\nreverse of this is the truth. I shall not stop to prove\nthat God has a providential government. The Bible\nand human consciousness agree, at times,\nat least, in this. The Prophet assumes it when\nhe says \"For when thy judgments are in the Earth\nthe inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness\".\nAnd the Psalmist responds to the truth of it from the depths of his \nconsciousness \"I know, O Lord, that thy judgments are\nright and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me\".\nnaturalism hides away its head when brought\nto face such events as occupy our minds this \nevening.

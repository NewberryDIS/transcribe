I am especially thankful to you for writing. I am rejoiced to hear that your health is a little better. I am very sorry for mother to think of her feebleness, and suffering, - her that used to be so active. I supposed from your letters she is gaining a little. I wish very often I could send something to help her. I hope my dear John Eddie will do all he can to help and seriously think of trying to be as possible a burden. I am quite in the dark as to how you are going to get along in your changed circumstances. I wish I could write that I am prospering.","549128b28d6a09e01797036411479219.jpg"],[35580,"My health seems to be pretty good. But I am not strong.

The last I received from you was from Rome.  I sometimes feel as if I had real occasion for gratitude for your letters, as I am so poor a correspondent in return.  I suppose Jenny is in New York, or has she returned?  Has Mary got home again?  I am glad to hear by Jennie's last letter that Mary's health is improving some.  Is it Homeopathy she is studying or Allopathy?  I hope Anna tries to keep up good courage - \"A merry heart doeth good like medicine,\" and sometimes a good deal more than medicine.  It is discouraging to have poor health dragging me down so long,","7ccf0ae0285b7a16e9c55768ab04359b.jpg"],[35614,"but I find getting discouraged doesn't help the matter any.\nThe weather here is getting pleasant.  Farmers are commencing or about to commence their Spring's work.  The nights are cool, and the ground freezes some, but it thaws out days and the land is getting dry.  I think we shall put in some oats next week.  \"The time of the singing of birds has come and the voice of the turtle (prairie chicken?) is heard in the land.\"  How beautiful the correspondence between Nature and the human soul.  My life's circle is a very small one here, but I frequently have occasion for joy and even gratitude in the bounty with which Nature and Nature's Author ministers to all the springs of enjoyment which we open in our minds.  I remember once President Green, as I was working in his garden (I was under a fruit tree) told me to stop and listen to the harmonious","b67ade35847ca27e4449d3868b39f4fb.jpg"],[35615,"sighing of the wind in the leafy tree.  It was the first time I had ever noticed that harmonious natural melody.  But it gave me many pleasant moments afterwards to listen to that whispered sighing, the notes never discordant or out of tune.  I like to watch the coming to life of my orchard in Spring.  The bare tree is pleasant to look on, the limbs all cunningly fashioned, seemingly the same kind of sticks stuck all over the tree, but if you look at it carefully you will see that no two shoots are exactly alike; and then you will notice that trees bearing different kinds of apples differ in general aspect - the family resemblance is different; some tend to make erect shoots, others send out wide spreading arms, as if they had a human feeling and wanted to put their fruit where it would be most tempting; and the drooping ones, mind, have the most","7e6b3a86a4af1e9642798624f2047b9b.jpg"],[35616,"fruit on.  I like to watch the first stirrings of life - the mysterious swelling of the buds, and a mystery it is which all science has not yet explained.  There is a large bud, that bud had got a blossom in it!  We could tell that certainly now if we should pick it off and cut across it we would see the future blossom all carefully folded and tucked in in the heart of the little bud.  But let us wait tranquilly, as nature tranquilly waits, and it will slowly (all too slowly for our impatience) swell and swell and swell, till by and by, as you go to observe it again there is a beautiful tinge of red on its tip.  Now your heart swells towards it! And then at last it busts out into real flowers, five, six, or seven of them.  And there is the first start towards an apple.  How much we have got before the fruit, if we will only take it.","5e0af4a18ad5ba6db65a64e1bdea42eb.jpg"],[35698,"Osawatomie Feb 7. 1885\nDear sister Jennie\nYours of Feb 2 was received day before yesterday. I was very glad to hear from you again. And you wrote last. I find it a good deal harder to write than I used to. I can not very well write after night. And my performance in writing, as in a good many other things, does not keep pace with my intentions. When I get a letter, I think I will answer it immediately. But immediately means too often to-morrow, and the tomorrows recede. When it comes it is to day, and it is to-morrow I will write. So I have revealed my weakness.\nWe have had a very cold winter","c9fdeafe335837ba2e5e42dd8aa78ecb.jpg"],[35699,"from Dec. 14 till within about a week. with a few days intermission early in this month. Now the snow is nearly all gone, and it is spring-like, with an April sun, and very little frost nights. It is very muddy. It is a half days journey almost to go to the post office & back, as we have to go by the bridge and the going is so bad.\nMy health is better than common, but of course am failing in strength. I generally lie down for an hour or two after dinner, but am around enough after night to make up for it. My life is uneventful. I have 41 head of cattle to look after cows and heifers and last spring heifer calves, - and eight head of horses. If I could see some at a reasonable price I would send you some money. Feed for stock is scarce. I have to buy, and will have to buy","20177c2b87d2e407d7db5fc5243b3c1c.jpg"],[35700,"some more. When feeding time is over and spring work begins perhaps it will be easier to sell. How are you getting along in money matters? How is Mary doing in New York? Does she practice any - in addition to her college duties?\nI am sorry to hear that Anna is poorly. I find Lactopeptine a great and indispensable help. Sometimes I take it continuously after every meal. Now I only take it occasionally. I find it a help to digestion, and in keeping the bowels regular, when I need it.\nI find my memory failing, and causing me trouble and slowness in work. I frequently go twice for two things (for instance to the milk room) when I ought to have done both errands together. Are you troubled that way? How is your hearing? The sight of my right is getting very dim, both for long","f22538c2c6ab72d8012973361b21a3ae.jpg"],[35701,"and short distances. The other eye keeps good. I found this out lately by breaking the left glass in my spectacles. It is the right side on which I am deafest. But I have no right to complain. I am writing this without glasses, and can read in the same way fine print day times, if necessary. \nIt is sad to hear of the death of old friends like John Roberts unclear. Was he long sick? He must have been considerably over threescore and ten.\nRemember me kindly to Mr. R.W. Prichard. Does he stay on the place another year?\nI must close with much love to you both from your brother\nJohn R Everett","76427c07d42a60471fb1bb522c460fbc.jpg"]],"transcount":11,"percentTranscribed":8,"date":[1850,1895],"category":"Family papers; Letters (Correspondence); Women","title":"John Roberts Everett and Sarah Colgrove Everett letters, 1850s-1895"}}}

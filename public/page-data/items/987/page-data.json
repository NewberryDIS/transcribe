I went to Galveston Texas, where my greatest pleasure was to watch the great, big waves splash on the wide, sea beach. \nUpon leaving there, I went to Vinita Indian Territory, to visit my old friend Mrs. Ida Bluejacket Wade. TO say that I enjoyed my visit with her is putting it mildly. She spoke very highly of you, and I think she is one of the sweetest little women living; she","ed91d2baef7d455269f868daa734b976.jpg"],[63453,"certainly deserve the comfortable house she has, and her husband who is one of Vinita's most prominent men may well be proud of her. Tho. I do not hear from Luzeua, I trust she is getting on nicely. I hope you are realizing your desires and are encouraged by your success.\nYours sincerely,\nEmily E. Peake.","bb6a98405d00abc72c82f7bf93876b1b.jpg"],[63454,"Mesa, Arizona. May 19 1912,\nDear Cousin,\nYours of 12th was gladly received, and will now answer it soon while I have time.\nI had received Georges & Yuma Frank's letter which was sent in my care. I told Georges all what you had said in the letter. But I did not get to see Yuma Frank about it so I let him have the letter to read it to him.\nYes I am always anxious to know what is going on in Washington about us Indian wheather sic they are going to move us or not.\nI had to tell George and Chas not to answer Mrs. Grey's letter. I know she was wanting to much from us trib. I hope whose that are helping you will stick together and do all you can to help us not to remove the Indian from McDowall, Because I heard the Indians say that if we are to move a way from our","a0daf11101ab652ec0dc939dc636683d.jpg"],[63455,"home Mc Dowall. to Salb River. They would go in the mountains to live, like they use to years ago.\nThey all are anxiously waiting to hear what is going on in Washington D.C.\nYes I shall see Julia when school is out which will be in June, and then I shall ask her whether she rec'd the letter or not.\nI shall be very glad to get the beads and will you please sent a fine neddles sic to work with?

It is not marked personal or private. He had my ? natures in his hands for two weeks in Feb'y & March 1903 less than twenty months prior to his letter and I only withdrew it on his urgency by letter telegram and personal conference that it was my duty to the Dept. How does this compare with his present statement that my standing would be better had I resigned three years ago?\nHe read a peepmca? paper at Mohonk and the inclosed extracts are copied from that","5f90812d65f18653674274d80c2c0e0e.jpg"],[63478,"3\npaper written at the same time as your letter.

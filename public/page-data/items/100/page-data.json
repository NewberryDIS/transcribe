We have been home since Friday, as I believe Jennie wrote you. Came just in time, as it was an unusually warm and lovely day ‑ and it has rained some every day since. Today or this P.M. it is snowing quite hard. Esther and little Frankie are with us yet, and are a great deal of company. Our girl, Sadie Parry, came today, a little girl about 13 or so I should think. I am gaining quite nicely I think — if I do not have another spell, think I shall get along.\n\nwritten sideways across top of page look for one pretty often when I go down to N.Y. I wonder how tall Gracie is now & whether she has quite forgotten us. When have you seen Mrs. ?. ? unclear —my love to her also Mrs. Winston We will bring some of the unclear with us — Shall I send one or two copies by mail?  Much love — I hope you will not stop writing now A. is a little better I have a letter near finished for J.

My head still pains me a good deal at times, especially when I get tired [symbol: upward carat] with throbbing and dizziness sometimes I am in hopes that it will be better as I get stronger. Have been taking China & Acorn — think it helps me. Have been feeling quite smart today, and walking about the house a good deal, but do not try to do [underlined] any thing hardly yet. Yesterday I did not feel so strong.\nRobbie began his school today so we will not be likely to send with him to the village quite so often as before. If he goes down tonight he has promised to let us know that we may send this with","61f53dc19824c804ac9bd649ad79a061.jpg"],[25015,"him — It was quite a disappointment for me not to be able to go down today but the roads must be very muddy. We are very thankful that Anna is gaining. We try not to worry about what we shall do next year or even this winter. It is a great relief to have some help. It will make it so much easier for us to get ready to leave — if indeed we do get away from here this winter. Yesterday Ellen Davies and her husband were here also Mr. and Mrs. Prichard — they took dinner with us and made quite a little stay — the rain began just as we were ready to sit to the table and that kept them a little longer with us. Mrs. Jones, bobin, and Lizzie Davies also called on their way from church, and Mr. & Mrs. G. Griffith — so you see we are not neglected.\nWe had a splendid long letter","ea6ba7ead2434e106559c5523d0c887c.jpg"],[25016,"from John Eddie, Saturday. He enjoys himself there — tho' he says every time that if we say so he will come right home. We think as we are not staying here this winter he had better remain with his father till we come back here. He is a member of the Literary Society and had just been elected President — an office which continues one month. His father's ^ health is about as usual, his shoulder no better! Do you think it is rheumatism?\nRobbie has a little molatto boy working for him —a kind bright,— active boy. He reads a little and I have promised to look up a book for him. I will give him a testament —and perhaps I can find something else that he can read. — I have not had time to look much. — Give much love to Mrs. Jones — I am glad she boards with David — tell Mary and Gracie they may","5de31a0425705f291436cc481f2c205e.jpg"],[25017,"[sideways across the top] ought to be with Edward some are on account of the books. — I believe this cold snap has taken my courage someway and you must make allowances. Please write often. Sometimes I wish all New Yorkers were well — I am thankful they do not keep you so long that you could find no time to write. Accept much love from both of us — your sister Jennie Everett\nHome, Remsin, Nov. 14 '82\nMy Dear Sister,\nYours of the 11th was received by us this morning and we thank you so much for your faithfulness in writing — your letters coming so often now cheer us and keep us company! and the cards and other pretty things are duly appreciated — we enjoy them ourselves, and they help us entertain our company! The cat that you sent in the time table is just lovely — so is the head you sent in the letter — we had no cat! Wonder if the mice will fear this one! —\nWe had quite a fall of snow yesterday and the night was raw and cold. The cows have been in all day today the first time this season","0d06fcb891aff6902e3e4dd5ea126cbb.jpg"],[25018,"as it has been freezing all day and the snow covers the ground. Sadie Perry, a little girl of about 12 or 13, came yesterday P.M. just before the rain changed to snow. We hope she will be contented to stay while we need her help and company. Her parents live in Jim Powell's new house — and they have quite a large family nine in all. The baby was Sadie's especial charge and she misses her most. She never has lived out before. Jane Esther and Frankie helped us put up the coal stove in the sitting room this morning — as Esther said it would be so much better for Anna and we find it very comfortable indeed — it is the stove we had in the parlor last winter. We also burn coal in the cook stove in the kitchen, so we keep the house warm. G. G. came for Esther & Frankie very soon after we had finished with the","61246febf378b014c3c08c30a31f38b1.jpg"],[25019,"stove and took them away before dinner. It seems more lonely without them. Frankie was so full of life — she kept skipping in to the bedroom to tell Anna what progress we were making and just what we were doing. This made the time not seem nearly so long, tho' poor child it was 11 a.m. before she was dressed and at dinner time she said it seemed as tho' she could not get warm anywhere — but when I opened the oven doors, she changed her tune! It is nicely warm now even in the bedroom. A. has been writing three pages of a letter to Mate this evening and gives me [[underlined][one]] page to fill! She is resting now on the sofa. May Ann brought little Lewis over this afternoon to visit us, and after awhile Libbie came too and we had a pleasant time with them. Mary Ann and Ikie have gone to the village tonight so we hope they will find something for us in the post office — I was sorry not to have had this letter ready to send. Anna","cb7ae6123b0934fbb23a2d83fa89451b.jpg"],[25020,"keeps on with the acorn and china — she takes them in water. She has not taken any of Dr Wiggins pills since coming home — her bowels troubled her and so she stopped and as you say the acorn and china act on the liver, I think she trusts to them. It is a week today since she had the last attack of nose bleed — We hope she will have no more. Her head troubles her a good deal all the time and she does not gain her strength very fast. He lies down most of the time — We hope the cold weather has not come to stay and that she will get strong enough to make you the proposed visit. — We are very glad to know you have heard from Edward as it is our first news from him since he reached Iowa City — two weeks or a little less ago. I must write to La Crosse — hoping to send to Remsen tomorrow. We had a pleasant time in Glyn, but not just as you imagine. Anna was very feeble and Mrs. P. quite timid about my leaving her lest she might have an attack while I was gone. So I did not have much running around — yet they were all very, very kind to us and we hardly know how to repay them. They would not make any bill! Neither would Jane Ester — She was here from Friday to Tuesday and Frankie too! Perhaps you can help us think of something — You ought to see baby's likeness. He is laughing and it is just splendid = Condl's\nand Charlie's are good too, but not quite so good. Write to Mate that she may not forget you while she has some left! Ellen Davies came in just as we were going to sit to dinner. She had just eaten at Robbie's so would not partake with us. It is sunny today and thaws a little now at noon. You say nothing about having us make you a visit this fall. Would it be a great disappointment if we do not go this fall? A. is not strong enough for us to make any great plans of going, and she feels that we","b104654341546a81b2800cc8abb80e22.jpg"],[25106,"all excepting John.

Then the mason came and as we could not keep the man any longer John Eddie had to do his best to wait on him.The second day he unfortunately let fall a large stone against the mason's fingers, hurting them pretty badly so that he had to leave. Afterwards his father came to finish and John Eddie in mixing mortar spattered lime into his own eye. Anna and Sarah got it out as well as they could and washed the eye with sweet milk.

It has been very painful. Dr Williams has been afraid from the first that it was cancer. She has suffered intensely and it has changed very fast lately so that Dr William said he must have some one to counsel with. He and Dr. Guiteau were there Monday of this week. On account of her age and feebleness they do not think it advisable  to cut it out and they give no encouragement. She is very patient and quiet, she says she does not suffer so much as she had done.

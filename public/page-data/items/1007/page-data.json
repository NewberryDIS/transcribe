She told me what you said about moving Regimental Headquarters to Gibson. If you find it necessary to stay there permanently of course it would be best. I don't care about being the Adjutant of the regiment any great length of time for any of the other Field Officers. I don't believe, however, we shall ever find as desirable a cavaly post for our regiment as this is at present, and therefore unless the work you have to do down there is going to be permanent, I don't believe it best to drop this post or to give an officer of another regiment a chance to come in here and command a part of yours if it can be helped. \nYou know best what you have to","4a4d2d02c74ed1f569ea3d44eae268ba.jpg"],[66294,"do at Gibson and if you are going to stay there, I don't want to stay here. \nThe new warehouse will have the roof on and floor in by Saturday or Monday night and I shall then put the new store in there as they arrive. They are coming in now very fast. I have received invoices of everything shipped and my estimates have been filled complete.\nThe McKibbin, Walsh, Pratt clique are as usual hostile and treacherous. I suggest to you it would be a good idea to burst it up. I think the Major might be made useful, if he is of any use anywhere, at the end of the track or some such place, and Walsh has only about 15 men in his company, I think it would be a good plan to send he and his officers with the few men they have to Senita Junction or some such place, where they would have a chance to recruit. They leave no opportunity unturned to say something which sounds detrimental to you and everybody about you. McKibbin keeps himself as usual as full as the","ac443b1d86f42ea90e96ccb8a3efe9df.jpg"],[66295,"rum he can get will make him. If he should, by any accident, fall in command here, he would doubtless displace me as a.c.s. &c by Pratt and I am satisfied that Pratt is trying to create dissatisfaction among those who are willing to listen to him, which that end in view. You have lots of friends here and they are the most useful officers on the post, and the actions of these other parties cannot help leaking out occasionally, so that I can see which way the cat jumps, though they are very smooth in my presence. I think Pratt, from his actions, thinks he will pull through all right with the Court and if he does, is fool enough to think he has gained a victory, after all his trouble, and I think it would be a good idea to put? him where he would have something else to do besides criticise his com'd'g, officer's actions, and where he would be harmless as any note. He is a sneak of the first water. I write at length on this subject because I think now is the time, while you","33638597371cc4d8dc9ccd283d698c5b.jpg"],[66296,"are changing companies to smash the clique.

T.  Sept. 3d 1874\nDear General,\n\n                         Your two last letters of August 10th and 21st are at hand.      The cause of our folks not hearing from me, was because one or two mail bags were sent from here to Caddo and returned here without being opened and my letters were delayed.  I always write home once a week or oftener.  Through the newspapers you have doubtless, by this time, heard of our little row at the Wichita Agency.  Gen'l. Davidson heard that a band of Noconis under Big Red Food who belong here and should have come in here before Aug. 3d & enrolled themselves, had slipped into the Wichita Agency and squatted alongside of the Peneteghkas.  He determined to go and arrest them and bring them here. We started at 10 o'clock","d10e2612cd0531dd316040a830adff53.jpg"],[66298,"at night with 4 cos. of the reg't. (C, H, E, &L) and reached the Agency at 12 the next day.  The Peneteghkas were camped just to the left of the Crossing of the Washita on the north side and these Noconis next to them.  We crossed the river & formed line and sent for Big Red Food & the other headmen of that band.  Red Food was right there and another fellow called Black Duck, which were all the men there who owned to being Noconis.  Their camp, however, consisted of about sixty lodges.  Gen'l. Davidson told Red Food that he had not come in to be enrolled at the proper time, that he was known to have been on the war path and that he must surrender his arms and go with him band back to Ft. Sill.  He agreed to do it, after earnest persuasion from Tosawa & Esetoyet, and I was sent with Morrison's Company dismounted, into the camp to receive the arms.  When I got there, they surrendered","06322242cc751722d548b60f1634de08.jpg"],[66299,"three old pistols and an old carbine, when a question arose about bows & arrows.  I sent back to Gen'l. D. to know if he wanted these given up, & also about packing the camp, as he had said before, he intended to stand back with the outfit that night.  He sent word back to me to take up Bows & Knives and that the camp must be ready to move in two hours.  Red Food then said he would not give up his Bows & arrows or Knives and that he would not go to Fort Sill.  He wanted to parley and make some other arrangement with me.  I told him I could make no arrangement and that he must go back and see the Comd'g. officer again.  In the meantime 50 or 100 Indians of all tribes gathered around on their horses and the thing looked squally.  I succeeded in getting him part way back","af26ed31570d97db3f456115d4fb4d67.jpg"],[66300,"when suddenly with a yell, he jumped his horse through the guard, who all fired on him, and ran like lightning.  The men think they wounded him but dont know.  We mounted the command and started into the Noconi camps when a party of Kiowas fired upon our rear from the Indian Commissary Building.  (You will remember it as Shirley's store when we were there in 1871 or 72.)  We dismounted and Little's company charged the building and drove them out.  We had some more scattered skirmishing during the day and again the next morning, but with no serious results.  We had three [strike] four men wounded and about six horses.  Horace Jones' horse Dan, was wounded and died that night.  My horse was also slightly wounded in the neck.  We got the friendly Indians who belong there, back again into their agency & leaving 4 companies there, returned to this post, after an absence of a week","74809adff2d8e458e52b7cb9119e79f2.jpg"],[66301,"2\n\n    The weather was fearfully hot especially on the days of the fight and we all came near being overcome with the heat.  One man died from the heat, on the return trip.    Col. Baird Inspector Gen'l. from Chicago arrived here two days ago, and this morning reviewed and inspected us mounted.  Night before last Gen'l. Augur with his son Jake and Capt Comly (Ordnance Dept.) arrived from Griffin, under escort of two companies 9th Cav'y.  I believe he intends to stay here until we start in the field, which will not now, I think, be before the 15 or 18th.\n  The programme is this, and I accidentally saw a copy of Mackenzie's letter of instructions the contents of which are probably not known to anybody else here.  He left Griffin some days ago with 8 cos. cavalry & 5 of Infantry for his","36673070748338b50b2c882fc44f3f14.jpg"],[66302,"old supply camp on the Double Mtn Fork of the Brazos.  He expects to get away from there about the 15 or 18th of this Month.  He skirts up along the edge of the Stoked Plains to about the head of the Red river, thence down it or the north or Salt Fork and so on to Fort Sill.  A Column of six cos. of Cavalry & two of Infantry under Lt. Col. Buell 11th Inf. has already left Griffin and I understand since our row at the Wichita Agency, is coming here.  It was intended to act between here and Mackenzie's Column and is under Mackenzie's order's. We leave here about the 15th with 7 cos. cavalry & 3 of Infantry, march to the Wichita Agency, thence up the Washita and perhaps across to the head of North Fork Red river as circumstances dictate.  Mackenzie's orders are, to come in to Fort Sill, and upon his arrival here assume entire","d1bd98eaccff20da22bd82983083ef41.jpg"],[66303,"control of Indian Affairs until he hears from Department H. Qrs.  This I know as I say it in a rough draft of his instructions.  I don't think Davidson knows this, but it virtually gives Mackenzie the control of the entire Campaign so far as this Department is concerned.\n\n   I wish you were here right now, I think the 10th Cavalry would stand a better chance to get credit for what it does; besides I don't consider Mackenzie a very safe man to conduct a large campaign or to control indian affairs.  He knows nothing of the routine of indian business on this reservation or at this post.\n   I forget to tell you, We have a small portion of the Kiowas here under Kicking Bird and his brother Son of the Sun, the balance are out & fought us at the Agency.  Kicking Bird tried to control the tribe for peace but could not do it.  then we have the","0b9200000dbba5fbe2880a4bededc3bc.jpg"],[66304,"most of the Yamparicas here; one band under Esenanica, came in since the enrolling, met us at Cache creek as we returned from the Wichita Agency and surrendered their arms.  The surrender did not amount to much, only seven old pistols & two old muzzle loading rifles having been given up.  But still it is an entering wedge.\n\n   Since the last turn of events, our supply camp on Otter Creek is broken up and everything is brought in.\n   Big Red Food is the Indian whom you will remember had a row with a soldier at the sutler store and struck him with his Tomahawk, and whom I arrested by your order.\n   We burned up his camp about sixty lodges & all their traps, but preserved the feneteghka ? intact.             During the fight, the Kiowas murdered six citizens whom they found out in the vicinity of the Agency.  Among these was Osborne a white man & son in law of Black Beaver.","b8ee229850bb039960506dae1bf8ec80.jpg"],[66305,"It was issue day when we reached the Agency and the Caddo's, Wichitas & the whole outfit were in there.  Just before the firing occurred, I knew from appearances there was going to be a row and I told Tosawa, & Wanloope of the Caddos, to get their people away from there.  If they had not have do so, there would undoubtedly have been some of these friendly bands killed by our fire.  As it was, the Kiowas fired on the Caddos and burned some of their houses.\n\n    Schofield is expected back here every day, and in case he arrives before we leave, is to have command of the Cavalry on the expedition; for you must know Davidson has organized his command, (7 cos. cav. & 3 of Inf.) into a brigade.

He claims to have killed 3 Indians whose bodies he got and captured 1400 ponies, mules & colts, about 1000 of which he had shot & kept the balance.\n\n    Sheridan is between here and Caddo and expected in tomorrow.\n    Davidson has made a strong recommendation to Augur for the establishment of a catonment on McClellan Creek, to consist of about 12 companies, Cavalry & infantry.  He made this recommendation in a letter to Augur while we were out, and which has not yet reached him as he left here before it arrived.","3c96548871e27a2cf1519d94ded6084c.jpg"],[66321,"He undoubtedly intends to make the same recommendation to Sheridan and urge it in such a way that he Davidson will perhaps be ordered to establish it, as he has nine companies now here available, though badly broken down.  He hopes by this to establish Hd.

Sill his command independent of you.\n\n   He asked me, while we were on the march how I thought you would like to establish a catonment on McClellan Creek.  I told him I thought you would approve of it in connection with Fort Sill as a base, as it was only part and parcel of a recommendation of yours so long ago as 1871, when you made an expedition to that country, as the means of breaking up the illicit Mexican trade and of controlling Indians on the Staked Plains","bc73c34841f57e365b1ab2812f3ee1c6.jpg"],[66322,"SLW  1874-10-15    237 [circled]     [all in pencil]\nand the head of Red river\n\n    I think you can readily see the game.

Pepoon committed suicide day before yesterday in camp near this place, by shooting himself through the head.  It was a cool deliberate act.  He quietly went into his tent, laid down on his cot, held the pistol to his head with one hand and pulled the trigger with the other.  The report was deadened so that he [strike] it was not discovered for more than an hour afterwards, when he was sent for to come to dinner; although at the time it occurred perhaps a dozen officers were in and around their tents on the same line with his.

I have been intimate with him lately, perhaps more so than any other officer","ee88be6feec548fb01e33906464758c0.jpg"],[66324,"and have noticed in him at times extreme mental depression; little petty troubles or annoyances, official or otherwise would cast him down in spirits to a fearful extent.

This last I tell, not from a desire to circulate it, but because I want [strike] think you ought to know it.\n\n    Well we are fast preparing for another expedition.  Sheridan has ordered us to march on the 21st.  We take about the same troops we had before, minus the dead horses and mules we left on the road.  We take 25 days rations and half forage and are going in about the same direction we did before, hoping to reach the breaks of Red river on our supplies, if we do not meet bands of Indians returning this way before we get there.

I told him I would assist him all I could and do my best to render the expedition a success; but he has not hot the elements of success in him.  He marches too slow and dallies away his time, sits down all night withing a mile of a stream to be bridged and looses two or three hours the next morning in bridging it and flatters himself that while he is waiting for his stock is getting fat on the damned poor grazing we find, while of course they are getting weaker every day we stay out, and of course the only way to do, is to make the dash while they are fat and strong and get back before they get dead poor.","2848587b75f49372ae63165032e83869.jpg"],[66326,"[ in pencil]   Woodward 1874-10-18      255\nI have just returned from poor Pepoon's funeral.  it was very solemn and impressive.\n\n    Sheridan is still here.

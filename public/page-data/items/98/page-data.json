It was such a treat to receive one from my father. Dear father, I thank you very much for your sacrifice of those precious moments spent in writing that well commenced family letter. Oh! that the others had been so faithful, then indeed it would almost seem as though I had seen all our pleasant family circle at my own loved home. That \"ancient scrap\" as you call it has however furnished me with a very pleasant chat with my father and mother and a short one with Sarah my sister. The regulations of our school I have already learned to love, not not only as being necessary but as the best that could be formed for a school of this size and character. There have been instances of girls here becoming sick in consequence of receiving food from their friends or purchasing, and therefor they made a rule in relation to it, so it has been with the other requirments of this nature; they have formed them as the case required, for example, our dining hall has been rather noisy before sitting down to the table and after rising while we were going out, Miss Whitman requested the young ladies several times to be more quiet, but this had on effect; so a new regulation was added to the others, that we should not speak at all after entering the dining hall until we sit down nor at all after rising from table. I suppose I should say in connection with this that when we go to table we all stand back of our own chairs until the tardy bell strikes, which is a sign for us all to be in our places, and then Miss Whitman makes","06de4cdf8eba070f213c117a87aaaee1.jpg"],[24743,"the first move, so you see we may not speak before the benediction is pronounced. I was very glad to hear that you had such an interesting meeting on the first day of 1850. My father's subject, mother told me in her letter, I think must have been very interesting, how I should love to have been there and heard him, even though I could not understand all he might say. Those maps which you mention I think will be a great acquition to your missionary meetings they have them at this church and they add much to the interest and the people get a much better knowledge of the mission fields. We have not had a missionary meeting this three or four weeks At our last we heard a letter from Miss Fisk, (who is graduate of this sem.) and is now in a mission school in Persia. It was was a very interesting letter. there was quite a revival in that school. Miss Hazen our assistant preceptress is going there next fall or rather she leaves this sem. then and it is not yet determined how soon after that she shall start. She is to be married to Mr. Stoddard who has been a missionary there among the Nestorians. I heard him preach one sabbath he is a very interesting preacher and seems very devoted to his labors, but I fear he can not live long, he lookes very poorly. - I must close soon for I may not \"cramp mothers part in a little corner.\" I have about 14 dollars now I shall need 30 to pay my tuition. They are very anxious that we should all have our money ready to pay the first monday of next term I should very glad if you could send me some by that time. We have to pay $1,20 a gallon for oil. It is provided for us here in the sem. we are not allowed to get it at the stores. Wood also is very high. I fear you will think I have been very extravagant with my money but I have","f7dcba5bb869174d4745682b877b068f.jpg"],[24744,"been as careful as I knew how. I should be very happy if my father would write to me again. I hope if ever I go home again that I shall be a better daughter than I have been for now I know better the value of a father than ever I did before. With much love\nI remain your aff. daughter Jane.\nSat evening\nDear Mother:\nIt is with pleasure that I address you in answer to your welcome letter. I thank you many times for devoting that new years day to writing to me. It was so pleasant hear from father and mother the same time. I was very sorry to hear that Sarah was no better. I do hope that Dr. Fitch will be able to help her. How long since Dr. Gittean has ceased to attend her? Did he consider her case as hopeless or did he think all the time that he could help her? I wish I could pass this next vacation with her, but this may not be and I am content to do that which is for the best. I do not think I should be homesick at all if Sarah was only getting well. It often seems strange to me, how I could ever summon courage to come so far to school and leave her so sick at home. I would write to her to night but my time is so far spent that I fear I cannot. I shall surely write next tuesday evening, if God permits. Tell her to keep up courage as well as she can. I wish Mary could be at home with her, I fear she is very lonely. Tell Gwen that I am very thankful to her for coming to keep my sister company and I shall ever love her for it. I hope Sarah's head will soon be better. Does it affect her eyes any? When next you write please tell as particularly as you can about her. I was glad to hear that Lewis' health is improving, hope he","395dbc2c306db5a5e240060b5250edef.jpg"],[24745,"has not entirely forgotten his sister Jane. I hope to write to him next vacation and to John also, I have had so little time that I have not done it before. I suppose Lewis has seen my letters that I have sent home so he has no doubts as to my existance. I had not heard of John's promotion. I hope he still remembers his ancient friends. How is Henry's health now I hope he has not forgotten that his name is one of the \"letter-writing society\" if he is rather remiss in writing. I wish John would join our league, I should be most happy to number my eldest brother among my regular corespondents & Lewis too dont you think he would add his name? I received a letter from Robert last tuesday eve. and also one from Elizabeth and Mary, I had quite a feast that night as you may well suppose. I have not answered Roberts yet. I was writing to Mary & Elizabeth when the letters came so I answered theirs. I do not think I shall be able to get a cloak, I think I had better get a thick sack which will answer the purpose pretty well, I can make that myself, it is almost imposible to get anyone to sew for me unless I got to Northhampton or Springfield which will cost me about $1.00 to go and return. I think I must get me a thick dress this vacation. They have very cold winters here and I must prepare for it. I think I shall get me some corse yarn to knit me some over-socks to walk in that my ancles may not get wet and some cruel to knit something to wear on my neck and also ears, dont you think I had better? Your asking me to favor you with a knowledge of how much my journey cost me reminds me that I have told you nothing about it. The fare form Utica here was $6,42 1/2 I will tell something about my journey when I write to Sarah next tuesday. Tomorrow is to be communion sabbath in this church.

Sem., June 24, 1850.\nDear Father;\nI was very glad to get that $5 which you sent last week, you ask about how much more I shall need. Brother Robert sent me a gold $5 piece a few weeks ago, which will be quite a help to me now, I have, counting that, on hand nearly $14 and though I cannot tell how much my sickness will cost me for I am not yet strong enough to wait on myself and? every thing, I think I shall need no more at present. It is quite doubtful whether I shall be able to study much this week. I hope to make up my lost lesson in philosophy so as to finish that this year I do not think it best to attempt any more. Next week thursday, we expect to commence our unclear in preperation for examination, and if I can attend to all my reviews I hope I can finish here in an other year, if my health is good. Do not feel anxious about me as I am getting better, though my strength seems pretty long in returning. I went to the stable last friday morn but as it tired me some Harriet thought I had wait a little before I go again. I went to meeting last evening (our meetings are in the sem. sat. eve)","ab4968a583089e8b13f2ad9f1c3a0dc1.jpg"],[24754,"so you see I am much better. Expect to take a walk out this afternoon. I have not been much sick and think it very strange how I lost any strength so?; perhaps it was because I did not exercise it. Last thurs. eve, the night I received your letter, Rev. Dr. Pour, who has been a missionary to Ceylon? 30 years and expects own to return, lectured in the sem. hall to the young ladies, I was very sorry not to be able to attend. They say he was very interesting. \"His text was, come thou with us, and we will do thee good.\" I have not heard a great deal about what he said, but one thing Hattie told me I thought I must relate to father. He said that there was only one class of females in Ceylon? who ever learned to read, they were called the dancing girls and they read in order to learn the songs. They never married and were regarded as the wives of the gods. They frequently steal children and educate them for dancing girls. He mentioned, this as one instance, a young girl who had charge of a white babe carried it out one day and the babe went to sleep, she laid it down in the shade and steped the other side of the bushes to pick some berries, while she was gone the dancing girls found the child and stole it. Great search was made for the babe but without success. Five or six years afterwards a friend told the mother that her child was at such a No. in a certain street, she immediately ordered her carriage and went to find it. When she drove up to the gate she saw several children","936591b9b6e8ff3c4b674e1bb8b52ce8.jpg"],[24755,"in the yard playing and a white child was with them which she knew to be her's. The child, as soon as she saw a white person, ran screaming into the house and clung about her dark mother's neck, for she had been taught that the white woman was a thief and the dark woman her mother. And now, said Dr. Pour, \"do you wish me to tell you what it is to be a missionary? it is to take that child and teach it who its mother is, and who is the thief. Satan is the dark person who has stolen these people from their Heavenly Father, and we want you to come with us, and help lead them to their Father, and convince? them that Satan is the thief.\" The rest of the sheet I suppose belongs to Mary. Please write again soon, you hardly how how much good even a few lines do me, with much love from your daughter.\nDearest Mary: I was very very happy to hear from you, and the next night I received a letter from Robert and both together made me so joyful that I hardly knew what to do with myself. I wanted to answer you that very night, but Harriet laughed at me because I had sent one that morning. I was sorry that you all felt so bad about my being ill as I have not been very sick. I hardly knew as I ought to tell you any thing about it, but Anne Gates said if I did not, she would. I am glad that you are all so well, but I fear Sarah does not im prove as fast as she ought, I wish she would take example of me and get well quick. A? person when sick is almost sure to be down spirited now and then, and I know how to pity Sarah when she feels so, I would much rather have the head ache or even tooth ache.","1792524dd5aab0000ca05b4625fdd2b1.jpg"],[24756,"When I get down hearted I sieze my pen and begin a letter to some of you and am soon cured. I would have given any thing could I have recalled the first part of my last letter when I found the effect of my other on Sarah, I did not think I had put anything in that like sadness. Tell her not to cry over this, for if she does I shall fear to write any more. I fell a great deal better than I did this morning when I wrote father's part. Only 38 more d before I start for home, three cheers for that time, then Sarah if you cry-- I had almost a mind to say you should get no kiss. Straw- berries are beginning to get ripe, I wish I could go out and gathe some and send them to Sarah, I know they would do her good. I have thought of something that I shall make her when I go home for a change, I will give her all the time till I come, to guess what it is. There has been quite an excitement here the past week, I told you in my last that three young ladies had been sent home. This was but the beginning of the troubles four more have gone and it is feared that others must leave before order and quietness can be restored. The teachers all have a very hard time and some of them are almost sick. As Miss Whitman and Miss Hazen are both absent the trustees have examined the cases of the unclear ladies and they decide their fate. I cannot tell you what their offence is as it is a long story I will leave that till I come home. They seem to have no regard for the teachers, themselves or any one else. I have not heard so much about it as I should had I been well but I know enough to be astonished that girls could conduct so, had it happened in Amherst College there would no be so much wonder. -- This is a very pleasant day, not so warm as if has been, yesterday it rained quite hard all morning and cooled the air I think.

I fear you think me very extravagant, but indeed, I strive to be as frugal as possible. I have not become nearly so strong as I was before being sick, and I have been obliged to hire my washing all the time since I was first sick. This will cost about $2. We all, I think I told you, are re- quired to work an hour every day and half an hour more wednesday. We must keep an account of how long we work, and if we do more than this they pay us for the plus time at the close of the year, if lefs? we must pay the for what we are minus. It will be nine weeks, when the term closes, since I have worked any, and I shall therefore have to pay for 59 hours (as the half hour of wed's is called an hour) the price is 3 or 4 cents an hour I think 4 but am not quite certain. Some say the Dr. charges $1 a visit and he has been to see me 7 times in all. I have been to ride 5 times for which I must pay 50 cents. I do not know whether I must pay any thing for having my meals brought to my room so long, if I do I should not think it would be much. I have now on hand $18 which I fear will not be enough.

I am regaining my health slowly- I am able to go into one review and shall have one examination I spoke to Miss Chapin about coming back next year. She thought I will have no difficulty to graduate if I have good health. Miss Whitman is not here. Miss Hazen returned the first of this week. I must close now lest I keep this from going this morn.

Other visitors have done so, and should not I? Other writers have had their journals published and given to the world, but I do not aspire to this. I do not want mine to go outside of me home circle. I shall write just as the thoughts occur; but I wish I could write them down as easily as they come. This is a beginning- not very extensive.

As morning dawned, a striking and beautiful scene presented itself, as the first streaks of daylight appeared behind us in the East, dimming at once the brightness of the stars, the lofty masses ? of mountains gradually lost their distinctiveness.  First the bright reflection of the snow faded away leaving a dim shadowy form looming through the gloomy twilight ? -- Soon however as the light increased the outline became clearer and more defined, but leaving word the mass word still cloudy and indistinct.  The outline of the ridges, the peaks and valleys became more and more exposed, until suddently the upper limb [[?] of the bright orb of day appearing upon the horizon of the plains, tinged the edges of the mountains with a golden hue and at once brought into sight the colossal figure of the mountains themselves, now clearly drawn against the clear blue sky.  Now the summits of the lofty peaks became distinct & the ragged outline of the chain, those nearest to us fringed with snow weighed pines, The sun bursting out at length in all its power & majesty threw its glittering beams upon the walls of snow which throwing back the reflection dazzled the eyes until they were unable longer to look upon the glorious picture.\nOften as I have seen the sun rise in many diferent parts of the world, I never have been so struck with the natural beauty of such a scene, as this morning.  I well remember the feeling of gratitude nay devotion to nature for providing so joyeous a spectacle to her children, which took possession of me.  My whole heart felt an elasticity I have seldom since experienced, and struck with the universal feeling I remember asking myself, Truly this after all is devotion, and so it was, and is, and the heart and not the lips is a universal prayer."},{"pageid":64443,"pagefilename":"9c71b2fac697159c6424c1c98474fd61.jpg","transcription":"upper right corner: 3\nWith the world for our cathedral and nature for an altar, what meretricious aid do we require to stir up in ouur hearts sensations of awe or devotion.

On one side rises abruptly the rocky sides of the mountain against which the well laden baggage frequently rubs and jostles, on the other some thousand feet of perpendicular descent, at the bottom of which rushed headlong amongst falling masses of snow and icicles of huge dimensions, though hardly”bergs”, a roaring torrent, its bed choked with rocks, over which we could occasionally discern a  string of loping wolves following on our flank.  In most places, between the track and the precipice, there was a ledge of snow of some 4 or 5 feet broad, beyond this “facilis discensus averni”.  In rounding a corner, the leading macho would strike his well secured load against an abutting angle of the rock.  In an instant slipping by the force off his legs, down he would thud on the ledge of snow with his head over the side, enjoying the view of the “gentle descent” below.\nHere, perfectly aware of the insecurity of his position and taking in at one glance of his brown expressive eye, the critical juncture, for in his struggles to rise with his back encumbered, the chances were less than even he would topple over.

In a few minutes, the track was filled and the sagacity of our mules alone could discover the line or path.  It was impossible to see before one the length of an arrow, and we could only advance at a snails pace.  At length we were brought to a halt, the leading mule refusing to advance a step.

Yet attached to the Polish Lancers.  right margin: 1\nAfter a few days spent in San Sebastian, I determined upon commencing my journey into Navarre, to join, if possible, the French Legion which I understood was to be met with either in that province or in Lower Aragon.\nHere I concluded the purchase of a horse and mule, paying of course for my whistle.  I also secured the services of an Aragonese as a servant, one Manuel Arteiza, as big a rascal as his country ever produced, but an excellent criado, and honest I do believe to me, although at war with the rest of the world. My intention had been to have gone round by Santanda & Bilboa, and so by the Ebro and Logroño into Aragon or Navarre.* A foul wind, which had lasted many days and promised to continue foul as many more, however prevented the Chasse-Marées from putting to sea.  I therefore lost patience and started off one morning at daylight by Passages and word to Bayonne.  From there skirting the Pyrennees, I passed Toulouse, Pau, & Oleron i.e., Oloron, from which last place I provided myself with a guide and extra mule, in order to cross the somewhat hazardous pass of Urdos into Spain.  An unusually severe winter & great quantities of snow rendered the passage exceedingly difficult, and I was strongly urge to wait for more favorable weather.  This however with my usual obstinacy, only determined me the more strongly to proceed, and one evening I found myself and caravan halting at the miserable Inn in Urdos which is the last civilized halting place, before entering the pass of the mountains.  Here we heard alarming accounts of the difficulties we were to enter upon in the morning.  The paths, bad enough in all times, were now completely blocked & hidden by snow, the least deviation from them would perhaps bring us down a precipice.  The wolves also were down from the mountains in great numbers, and many tales of devoured travellers and other horrors, were poured into our ears.  Manuel, scratched his head, opened his mouth, ejaculating Jesus Maria — Jesus Maria while my Oleron guide, albeit an old draughter, and used to the Mountain passes all his life, shrugged his shoulders, and it required an extra dollar or two to induce him to undertake the journey.\nA bota of brandy was added to our stock and other creature comforts provided, and leaving directions to Manuel to call me an hour before daylight, I turned in.\nNext morning when I rose, I found the guide and Manuel preparing the chocolate and frying some ham and eggs.  The people of the house snoring in their different beds in the kitchen from one of which the daughter of the house, too lazy to rise, was pointing out the locale of the different articles required.  Into her hands as she lay half asleep, I was requested to pay the cuenta, and with a mumbled prayer for our safety  from the old landlord & landlady in one corner we sallied out.\nIt was a piercingly cold morning, the sky clear and bright with countless stars.

When he had placed the mule between himself and the danger, whatever it was, he gasped out in faltering accents, the following disjointed explanation:\nJesus Maria: Jesus Maria, viene la hora ultima, perdoneme, Santa Viergen.  The last hour is approaching, pardon me, Holy Virgin — Ya ha venido el demonio, alante el qui quiere verlo.  The devil has already come for us, let.

Por dios, Caballero, habla con el, word, for God sake sir, speak to him, somos Christianos todos, we are all Christians tell him.\nThe ridiculous fright of Miguel was so exquisitely absurd that I thought I should have rolled off my mule with laughter.  He was beating the snow with his feet in short  jerks, turning round and round, bemoaning his hard fate, and uttering a sentence every now and then of an ave Maria, or pater noster.  His companions, were speechless with fright, or frozen into dumbness by the unexpected announcement of the arrival of the old gentleman..\nAs however I saw that something must have caused the sudden fright of the mule as well as Miguel, I dismounted from my mule, and wading through the snow crept under the belly of the leading mule, for I was unable to pass, and advanced a few yards before him.\nThe track here was gradually ascending, and here and there a mass of rock almost filled up the narrow path.

Miguel however declared that we were within a short distance of a hut, which was the residence of a family of those unfortunate outcasts known in the Pyrenees as Cagots.  Nor was he wrong, for in a few minutes we heard a shout, and answering it by a lusty holloa, we soon had the satisfaction of seeing a man wading through the snow staff in hand along the track we wished to proceed.\nThrough Miguel I understood, for the Cagot’s basque was perfectly unintelligible to me, that the hut was within two hundred yards of us, and that we should be obliged to put up there for the night, it being perfectly impossible either to advance or retreat.\nLed by our guide, we turned an angle of the rock and came upon a small level plateau where under the shelving rock, which seemed to threaten momentary distruction we dismounted at the door of the Cagot hut. \nSuch a hut.

From the necks of every individual save the younger children, the hideous goître depended in disgusting flakes.  There seemed however no lack of provisions, for a newly killed bear hung from a beam near the fire, and the children were picking off pieces of the fat and stealthily carrying them to their mouths, whilst two enormous gaunt lank sided hogs roamed at will amongst the children and a sow with young about her was lying on her side before the fire, one child feeding it while another was drawing from its teats that sustenance denied by its sickly emaciated mother.\nThe filth everywhere apparent beggars discription, and on entering I looked in vain for a nook or corner where I might esconce myself apart from the poor disgusting objects which surrounded me.

This tree always prefers ridges of high land, and a lighter or sandier soil, than is found in the lower lands.  Here the game is always plentiful, the deer loving to browse on the young saplings, the wild turkey feeding on the nuts, and the bears generally choosing the hollow of a beech tree wherein to ensconce themselves during the rigours of winter.  The beech is also the chosen quarters of the black squirrel, which little animal often varies the venison or bears meat dinner of the Indian or White hunter.\nArriving on this creek after several days journey from Lake Erie on the banks of which we had followed our fall hunt, we fixed upon a space of about fifty square yards of crossed out: elevated open ground, formed by the sudden bend of the creeks and surrounded by a wall of lofty beech tress.

We presently heard the snapping of twigs, and noise of some animal bounding over the brittle twigs, and soon three deer leaped across our path, a fine buck leading at a tremendous pace.  To cock my rifle, & let drive at him, was the work of an instant, but I had the mortification of seeing the hairs fly from his back by the word, but the deer bound off unhurt.\nAn Indian soon emerged from the shadow of the trees, and approaching, we at once knew him to be a Pottawatomie, by his paint and particularly by a above the next word, the number \"2\" peculiar kind of turban which is much worn by this people.\nHe told us, that many of his people were out in the woods but from the unpropitious state of the weather had been as unfortunate as ourselves in not killing game, that many of them were nearly perishing from want of food, & that he himself had been 2 days without other food than a few frozen acorns.\nHe had shot at the deer, which passed us, but they were running, he imagined, before wolves, and too rapidly to give him a chance of hitting one.  However, he told us that he had seen some raccoon tracks not far off, and he might perhaps succeed in finding & killing one of these animals.  The anticipation of roasted 'coon, soon put us on the track, and following our Pottawatomie guide a short distance through the woods, he pointed to a log, at the top of which there was still a little snow, and where the luckless raccoon had imprinted his not to be mistaken track.  However, the ground was so intensely frozen, that on leaving the log, no traces of our game was perceptible even to an Indian eye, and dispersing, we sought a long time in vain, in different directions, for any evidence of the fugitive.  At length a shout from one of the Indian boys proclaimed his success and following the sound to a lofty hickory, we found the boy carefully examining the bark of the tree,"},{"pageid":64483,"pagefilename":"ead4ef2dd008e01dba3b8d89492afad8.jpg","transcription":"4\nwhere sure enough, we percieved the marks left by the animal's nails whilst climbing up the trunk.\nA brace of axes were soon thudding into the body of the tree; and presently a warning shake of its lofty head cautioned us to stand clear of its fall, when at first with a graceful bow it inclined towards the surrounding trees, quickly losing its center of gravity down it crashed to the ground, stripping limbs & bark from others in its descent, bringing with it a perfect wreck of branches.  As soon as it was down we rushed to the fallen trunk, from which, as soon as it touched the ground, bolted a fine fat raccoon.

In a short time another fine fat fellow was drawn from a hole in the tree, and quickly dispatched, and before five minutes were over, one was already divested of his jacket, and broiling over a fire, which one of the party had promptly kindled.  It required neither bread nor salt to flavour this meal, which after a fast of 36 hours was opportune enough; and to which it may be imagined we did ample justice; as the well picked bones testified after our repast.

However little credit can be attached to the character of an Indian given by one of a different tribe, for an hereditary enmity or rather jealousy is characteristic of these peoples, whose different tribes have been naturally born enemies from time immemorial.  Knowing this, I did not listen with much attention to the following remarks of Peshigo Peshwego, who after proceeding some way in silence, commenced an abrupt harangue to me on the Pottawatomie character.\nMaybe, he began, you like these peoples.

We reached our intended halting place about sunset, devoured the other raccoon, and rolled up in our blankets before the fire.  As the snow would render the hunting excellent, I was anxious to return to our camp, but the Indians were determined to wait until the Great Spirit was propitious, so finding they were not be induced, the next morning before daylight, I shouldered my cross and returned alone to the shanty.  I was in sight of it when I came upon the tracks of three deer, which had passed only a few minutes before, and though the daylight was fast waning, I followed them until the track led me to a ridge of beech saplings, where I discovered the deer browsing.  I quickly levelled my rifle at the nearest, and killed it -- brought it to camp, skinned & cooked a collop for supper, after which  much fatigued, I slept soundly until morning.  On leaving the hut the next morning I found that several wolves had been round the deer, which was hanging on a gallows, and had carried off the head & neck.\nThe next day I had a long hunt.  The deer were wild, and though in great numbers, were difficult to approach within shot; so that after following some for many hours, I found myself far from camp, and evening already closing in.  Looking at my compass, I struck through the woods in the direction of the shanty, but night was word coming on and the woods being dark as pitch, I had great difficulty in keeping a straight course.  The wind was moaning in fitful gusts through the tops of the trees, through which not a ray of light penetrated, to enable me to consult my compass, save by removing the glass & feeling the direction of the needle with my fingers.  Heavy flakes of snow were falling which even as I emerged into a more open part of the woods, drifted into my face, adding to my discomfort.  I was never out in a darker or more dismal night.  Occasionally I heard the deep baying howl of a wolf on the track of a deer, or the dismal hoot of an owl close to my ear, than the shriek of which bird, nothing living is more unearthly.  Stumbling over logs, running against trees, falling into root holes full of snow, on I floundered.  But I hit upon an expedient by which I was enabled to steer by the compass, which was, simply by lighting my pipe which I had only to hold near the compass to afford sufficient light for the purpose.\nI had been many hours on my march; when at a moment"},{"pageid":64486,"pagefilename":"2d1622b5c31f46f155f33cad2862c9fb.jpg","transcription":"7\nthat I was thinking of lying down for the night on the first log which presented itself.  I percieved a small check of light apparently in the bushes just beside my & which seemed to be moving in the darkness.  I at once set it down as a wolf, the eyes of which, it is known, shine in the dark like a cats, therefore cocking my rifle, and throwing it forward into my arm in readiness, I approached cautiously the spot where I fancied the wolf might be standing watching me\nHowever, as I drew near, the beast did not seem to change its position, the speck of light appearing in the same place, but as I approached I thought it grew larger.  At length, somewhat doubting I quickened my step towards it, when I saw more of the same light, and presently many sparks flew into the air.  I was now convinced that the light proceeded from my shanty, through the crevices of which the flickering light came, but as I most certainly had extinguished the fire before leaving in the morning, I was unable to account for it, expect by supposing that some Indians had rekindled it.\nApproaching the shanty as noislessly as I could, I soon percieved that a roaring fire was blazing within; & creeping up, I looked through a chink in the wall, and beheld a sight which did not altogether delight me.\nSpreading his hands over the fire, sat an Indian, in the well known dress of the Pottawatomie.  So motionless was his posture, that for some moments I percieved it was a sleeping figure.  He sat opposite to where I was looking, so I had a good opportunity of inspecting him.  He was a tall powerful looking savage with his naturally swarthy face, rendered more striking by lines of red paint which crossed transversely his whole countenance.  A picturesque sort of turban, of red cloth, in which was stuck a single feather, covered his head, while a shirt of deerskin (but a sorry covering from the cold of winter,) confined at his waist with a belt in the was the usual hunting knife, and leggings of the same, with moccasins completed his costume.  No sooner had I caught a full glimpse of his countenance, than I was aware, that my approach had been heard by him.  His whole face gave at once the idea of the most intense watchfulness, though to one unaccustomed to the study of the immoveable features of the Redskin -- his appearance might have indicated the perfect repose of security --  The head a little inclined to one side and slightly raised, as a dog may be seen to do when listening attentively, the mouth"},{"pageid":64487,"pagefilename":"5c1fb8cebc579a00fe1e5e8cbac2761a.jpg","transcription":"8\npartly open, and the muscles of the body, though in apparent repose, were rigid as stone — Nor did it escape me that the rifle stock was at his sie, within grasp, and the knife loosed in the sheath — Though I confess that I might have been better pleased with other guest than a Pottawatomie, particularly after my friend Peshigo’s Peshwego’s discription, yet I made up my mind to enter, without any appearance of distrust; In throwing aside the deerskin which served as door, I entered at once, with the usual Indian salutation of howgh — howgh — and proceeded to disencumber myself of my rifle & pouch, during which the Indian relapsed into a perfectly indifferent posture.\nWhen I had taken off my wet leggings and moccasins, I sat down opposite to my dusky guest, and had more leisure to observe him.  His cheeks I observed were fallen in and his whole face painfully attenuated, his long body too appeared gaunt & half famished which indeed I found was literally the case.  He had actually been three days without food for although he had seen many deer, his rifle was so out of order that he could not get it off.  Having seen my tracks in the snow, he followed them to the shanty, but though venison was hanging from the roof, and he was famished for food, he had waited ‘til my arrival, which he said he was certain of, because I had left my blanket behind me, before he satisfied his hunger.  in pencil X not the custom of the wood.\nI soon had a pot on the fire with some choice pieces of venison, which the poor fellow watched like a famished wolf.  He had neither pipe nor tobacco, and whilst the meat was boiling, I gave him a pipe which he greedily devoured.  The hot venison broth soon restored him, and after having done ample justice to the tender meat, he lit his pipe and we chatted, as well as my imperfect knowledge of the language allowed me ‘til late.  He told me that many of his people were hunting in the woods, but the weather had been so unfavorable, that they had been very unsuccessful, and many were almost starving. He himself had been out for weeks, but had killed nothing but a few squirrels &c and word crossed out had subsisted entirely of what few nuts & acorns he could find in the woods."},{"pageid":64488,"pagefilename":"3b9aa5e4defc31da8a8e8fa656245059.jpg","transcription":"9\nHe remained my guest for a few days; and I frequently hunted in his company.  He was one of the best rifle shots I ever met with, and with my rifle performed many wonderful feats in fine bead drawing.  He was also a good hunter, particularly after turkies: which he never failed to come up to if once on the track.  A turkey hunt, which we had together, was very successful.  One night he returned to the camp with a fine gobler, and told me that a flock of thirty were roosting that night on a beech ridge, within a mile of our shanty.\nAccordingly some hours before daylight we were on the ridge, waiting quietly until the morning broke, when the turkies would leave their roost.  The Indian had seen them take wing for the trees the night before when he had killed one, and not far, he thought, from the shot we then were.  In the interim we lit our pipes sitting quietly on a log amongst a thick clump of beeches.  Just as day was breaking, a rustling in the branches of a tree over my head roused me followed by a loud clear call from the same tree.  It was instantly answered by another, at a little distance, and taken up by the next, until the woods seemed to resound with the noise on all sides.  The Indian, at the first alarum, had pulled me behind the log, where with rifles cocked, we awaited our opportunity.  It was just light enough to enable us to look along our barrels, when a commotion in the same tree from whence the first call proceeded warned us to prepare.  Now, as the light first disclosed the top of the tree to us, we saw a large dark body descending from branch to branch occasionally uttering a loud cluck.  When it came to the first branches, I could plainly see the figure of a large turkey, and was on the point of firing at it, when the Indian restrained me.  I soon found the wisdom of this proceeding, for as soon as the bird hopped to the ground a few loud repeated calls brought the remainder of the flock one after the other, running swiftly over the snow & contrasting with their shiny black plumage.\nTwo or three had joined the old gobler, when the Indian motioned that now was our time: so levelling at the father of the flock, I laid him sprawling fluttering on the snow, where  another victim was also soon fluttering, shot by the Indian.  The reports of the pieces did not appear to alarm the others, for my companion putting his fingers on his mouth, soon brought them trooping up, by his own ? emulation of the call."},{"pageid":64489,"pagefilename":"07b454b3afb55f85e5e265b4020596fc.jpg","transcription":"11\nCrossed out: Captured in a day.

With but one blanket to cover me, I often felt the cold very severe, particularly when it was drawing towards morning.  At this time the fire would be gradually becoming lower, and we always felt too chilly or too lazy to doff our blanket and seek some more wood to replenish it.  During the night awakened by the cold I would draw my blanket over my head and crouch near the fire and lighting my pipe would enjoy a good roast.  Having imbibed sufficient calories, I would brave the freezing air, and turn out for a load of wood.\nAs soon as the wood burned up, throwing a cheerful blaze for some distance into the woods, and revealing the slumbering forms of the Indians, rolled in their blankets, with their feet to the fire. One by one they would rouse up & their pipes in mouth, occasionally looking up as the falling flakes of snow hissed into the blaze and the sighing of the wind over the tree tops  gave fair promise of a fine hunting weather.  Knocking the ashes out of their pipes, without speaking they would again seek their freezing couch, and their heavy regular breathing soon proclaimed they were once more in the land of dreams.  The last hour of darkness, when a faint greyish mist seems to tinge the sky, the forerunner of the coming dawn, is known to every one whose lot or choice may have prompted him to pass a winter night under the hospitable canopy of Dame Nature as the most intensely cold of the 24 hours.  At this time the half frozen hunter is roused by the searching frost, and crouching to the fire is dismayed by seeing only the smouldering embers of what was a few hours before, a blazing bonfire.  Although abundance of wood is round the spot, he shudders at the thought of casting off his blanket to penetrate into the freezing gloom, at the same time hoping that one of his companions may be bolder than himself and run the risk of having his fingers frozen.\nOften have I been roused by a sensation of almost freezing at this hour, and finding the fire out have rolled word the embers, almost burying myself in them.  Too lazy however to  replenish the fire, I would wait in expectation that one of the Indians would presently do it:  but I always saw them offer a look of dispair at the smouldering ashes, quietly resume their positions, rolling themselves into a ball, and covering every part of their bodies with their blanket.

Loading as quickly as possible and leaving the four dead birds hanging on a tree, we soon followed on the tracks of the birds which left us far behind, although the long slinging trot led by my companion brought us up to the wounded bird which was lying panting & bleeding on the snow, where he had sunk exhausted from loss of blood.  In the evening  towards sundown, we again came upon the flock, this time feeding in apparent security, but two quickly succumbed to our rifles, thus making a bag of seven of these magnificent birds.  When we had collected the slain, we found we had enough to do, to carry them all, but staggering as well as we could under our load, we reached the camp after sunset, and feasted on part of one of the birds.  \nTwo or three days after, I had a close view of the remainder of the flock,  which had fallen a victim to their stupidity in an Indian trap or pen.  I had followed several tracks for some time when I suddenly heard a tremendous uproar a short distance ahead of me.  Hastening on, I came upon a turkey pen, which some of the Indians had formed, & which had entrapped 11 fine fully grown birds.  These silly fowls are taken in the following manner.  In a part of the woods, where turkies are known to resort, the Indian or White hunter forms his pen.  It is merely a square inclosure of rough logs about 6 feet square and 4 ft in height, th top covered in with smaller logs, with an interval of 6 or 8 inches between each — At the sides the lower bar is wanting, leaving a space clear from the ground of 18 inches words.  A train of Indian corn is then laid from different parts of the woods, leading to the pen, which is strewed with the corn.  The turkies coming upon the trains follow it, pecking it up until they reach the trap, when, entering they quickly devour the remainder.  When all is consumed, they attempt to find an exit, but all their endeavours are exerted to get  out at the top, through which they thrust their long necks, but without attempting to escape by the way they entered.

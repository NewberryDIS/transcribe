I am ashamed that I have been so long without writing to you.  Do you know that I dread to write letters more than I used to.  I suppose I am growing old.  Isn't that strange? We have ha a very pleasant summer, not very warm, and have all been well. which is such a great blessing.  Mr. B. says he feels as well and strong as he did ten years ago.  I hope you will some time be able to come out and see us here.  We mean to see you next summer if we can but that seems so long to anticipate.\n\n(along top of page)\nEvening.\nI am alone this evening, Mr. B. and John are in faculty meeting and Hattie is in society.  So I think I will write to Kansas.  I have not heard from John for some time. I am owing him a letter.  With much love to yourself and all and hope to year soon, \nElisabeth"]},{"pageid":36769,"pagefilename":"68235de766f02a13dc51a57c96acc19d.jpg","transcription":["We have just closed our vacation and term has commenced with a large number of students, which gives plenty of work to the teachers.  Today there are no recitations.  Monday is the recreation day here instead of Saturday.  John has his four classes mostly in Latin, and seems to like his work well.  Hattie is in the Senior class.  She takes the scientific not the classical course which omits the Greek.  Lizzie has a cozy little home about half a mile form us, a house with four rooms all on the ground, just large enough for them.  The baby is ten months old and is improving every day.  We all think a great deal of her of course.  I stepped out a moment and when I cam back to these blots:  please excuse them."]},{"pageid":36770,"pagefilename":"9eb5171fe0c0a8df30b63c7bf4c47a9a.jpg","transcription":["Cynthia must have been very sick, and you must have been very anxious about her.  The last Jennie wrote she says she is better. does she continue to improve and will she get well.  Poor child she must sometimes feel discouraged. I am a good deal anxious about you having so large burden in that great city.  You must not get sick too.  Do you teach still in woman's college?  I can only think of you as hurrying here and there and I am so afraid you will get sick.  You must remember - going a little too far is the danger. if you could take it easier. you would last longer.\n   There are medical springs about 50 or 60 miles from here that are much frequented."]},{"pageid":36771,"pagefilename":"eca32a617af70e6a724b769c0c6984b6.jpg","transcription":["At Eton Rapids.  I have been thinking some of trying them. though my general health is so good that I do not need it for that.  I understand there are three ladies living there that used to be students at Clinton.  The Harvey girls we used to call them.  I sometimes see persons here that used to know you.  Dr. Tallet and his wife live in Coldwater about twenty miles from here.  We were there about two weeks ago and Mrs. Tallet inquired about you and was very glad to hear that you had studied and were practicing medicine.  She thinks there ought to be more lady practitioners.  Cynthia MCKoon that was, now Mrs. Starr, do you remember her at Whitestown?  She inquired also about you.  I must go now and geet tea.

Certainly it is long enough since I have written that I ought to remember you now.  My thoughts and my heart are with you often but my pen alas is too often remiss.  How many times we have thought and spoken of that pleasant visit with you in New York.\n  I fear you have a pretty hard rough time there, but you have wonderful courage, which is half the battle.  I am often afraid you will not be careful enough of your own health in caring too much for others."]},{"pageid":36773,"pagefilename":"4b1b7ba91a1f670e3f92edf29789be38.jpg","transcription":["We have had and are having a remarkable winter so mild and pleasant no snow.

This makes her very busy this year.  Lizzie's baby grows and improves, but does not walk yet. though the 24th she will be 15 months old.  Lizzie is well but does not get her strength up well.  It was a hard draw upon her little body.

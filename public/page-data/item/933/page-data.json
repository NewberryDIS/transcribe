Co.\nvia Fort Laramie Nov 26, 1866\nMy dear Doctor\nAllow me to introduce my friend Capt Jackson of the 15th US Infantry, who has relieved me on the Recruiting Service in Cleveland.  He has expressed the wish to make the acquaintance of your family, and so fresh in my memory is your kindness to me while a sojourner in your beautiful city that it is a privilege I should wish every friend of mine to enjoy.  Enroute here I fell in with Genl Terry, and had the pleasure of his company on the Boat from St. Joseph to Omaha.  I cannot begin to tell you how much I was pleased with him, a more elegant gentleman I have never met.  My journey was a very long one, and had it not been for the politeness and hospitality of the officers at the different posts along the route, would have been very tedious.  I am now very pleasantly domiciled in an excellent log house, which"},{"pageid":58149,"pagefilename":"c4e2e0ae09c659754cf7ed1ac72578a1.jpg","transcription":"my company hastened to build me on my arrival, and feel perfectly contented with the country, and the life I am to lead.  The Indians are very hostile and barbarous, and annoy us in every way they can.  Yesterday with about 30 mounted men I chased a band of them who had run off some stock.  Rode 40 miles and recovered all the cattle but five, which the Indians shot with arrows to prevent them from falling into our hands.  I, with three other officers, while riding out to view the country a few days since, fell into an ambuscade of Indians who fired a volley at us.  Our escape was a very narrow one.  Returning with a few Infantrymen who happened to be near guarding some woodchoppers, we scoured the woods, but the Indians had decamped.  We are afflicted with an incompetent commanding officer viz. Carrington, but shall be relieved of him in the re-organization, he going to the 18th and we becoming the 27th Infantry.  We have four companies of Infantry and one of Cavalry at this post, and are favored with the presence of four ladies.  The locality of the post is pleasant, being about 7000 feet above the sea.  The atmosphere is very dry and rare"},{"pageid":58150,"pagefilename":"840046dd68039034cf609ef5001dfee1.jpg","transcription":"almost oppressively so to a new comer.  The climate so far as we have experienced it is delightful.  Today we have spring like weather.  The country is rough but abounds in game of every kind.  Enroute from Laramie being mounted I had a very exciting Buffalo chase, and wounded three, but they are very tenacious of life and would not die.  Our table though scantily supplied with Eastern delicacies is always provided with game of some description.  While chasing the Indians the other day we passed Buffalo, Elk, antelope, wolves and a large bear, but were too intent after the nobler game to pay them any attention.  I trust that all in your family are well.  The young ladies have doubtless returned from Detroit 'ere this and Miss Julia received the scolding she deserves for staying away so long.  Please present my kindest regards to each member of your family.  I would also like that one of the ladies should remember me to Miss Woolsen.  I was a guest of her kinsman General Wessells at Fort Kearney, who made many inquiries after her family.  I [would?] be very much pleased to hear from you.

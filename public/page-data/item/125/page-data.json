Fear you are thinking altogether too much of others and too little of yourself, as you always do. Wish you could have a better\nchance to rest. If you could be here while father is gone I should be glad. Hope Father will have a good pleasant time. You ought to try to rest while he is gone. I have enjoyed having the girls with me.

Hope she will be stronger in two or three weeks and then she will be likely to have no difficulty. We are all in normal health. The children are enjoying the pleasant weather very much. Wish we could all come out and see you this Summer. Perhaps we may another year if spared. I want to see you. Fear you are wearing yourself out too fast. We had a letter from Sarah Sharis? last week.

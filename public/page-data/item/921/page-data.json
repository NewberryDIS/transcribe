Hearing her fathers words, and his question, if she would not consent, I noticed a perceptible blush and at the same time she gave me an evasive answer. The old man did not like it, he demanded a peremptory answer, but she was equally as resolute and the only answer he received was a quick and silent retreat from the shop, much to my relief.

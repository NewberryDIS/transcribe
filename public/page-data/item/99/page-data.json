It is sad to be ill even when cheered and blessed by the sweet smiles of our parents, but there is a bitterness mingled with it when far sepperated from them. I long to see you all, but none so much as them. There is a place, I think, in every heart which none but a kind father and mother can fill. We cannot expect, my sisters, to be always with them, duty will sometime call us from their side. O, then, seek to know and perform their every wish and you will love to review those happy moments, how often have I wished, since coming here, that I had been more dutiful. Education cannot be acquired without some sacrifice, and it is well worthy of any we can offer, when then, this object is being advanced, we should never complain - As I lay this morn sighing that I could not persue my studies, I thought of Sarah, and could but say,\nI wish I was a tiny bird,\nThat sweetly sings its praise,\nAnd not one note is ever heard\nOf discontent to raise."},{"pageid":24841,"pagefilename":"084d91472706b7c0f4498c28317c72c3.jpg","transcription":"I long for the time to come when I can begin to teach.

Of water to drink, he bid, me not think, but a brown crust take and with it make a little coffee and I should see it would quench my thirst at the very first without any danger that it should injure my sick body like water toddy. If at length I gained no strength, and might wish to change my dish, why then, some gruel thin, made of rice boiled quite nice, in water much, would be such as he should choose that I would use, for he knew that if I grew very unclear there on the spot, I must suffer with the billous fever. As to eating that was another thing, it would do no good to take any food, while I felt just ready to melt, with a fever he could scarce discover, so the Dr. said, and bowed his head, bid me good day and went away. Of course I obeyed all the Dr. bid and very quick was quite weak, but now I am better and send this letter to tell you, how I do.

I do not wish to urge you to do any thing that would not be well for you and therefore only mention this and hope you will act your own pleasure. I should like to read Virgil again and think I shall set apart a particular hour each day for that purpose (even if you do not come home), so that I shall be prepared for examination as soon as I go there.

If convenient I should like to have a little more sent by Mary. It will be time at the first of the term for us to pay the rest of our tuition and she will need to bring 60$ (30$ for each). I forgot to write about this sooner as we were requested to have it ready the first of the term. You had better send it with Mary as it will be soon enough then. I am sorry to hear that you have all been sick. Wish I could have been with you. I must not write but a few very lines as it is most too late for the mail. I am quite well. Sarah thinks she will be happy to go to our home. She is an excellent sewer and I think if you could have Mary Jones to help about the house you had better have her do your sewing. You know there is a great deal of that to do and I do not know as she would wish to stay long. She is well prepared to teach and has been more accustomed to doing that. She will be a daughter to you while she remains as she has been a sister to us. Good bye now with much love.

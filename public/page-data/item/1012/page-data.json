I have long felt anxious to place on record some circumstantial account of this marvellous proceeding; for, as will be hereafter seen, its strange and peculiar character has prevented the possibility of its being included among my published works.\nIn the first place it must be regarded as a strictly religious ceremony; that, in all its parts, it is uniformly conducted with the solemnity of religious worship, attended with abstinence and prayer, and in some of its details with excruciating torture.

Great lassitude and emaciation resulted from this severe discipline, and thus they were in some measure prepared for the self-inflicted torture to which they were afterwards subjected.

There were also four sacks, each containing some three or four gallons of water, which seemed to be objects of superstitious regard, constructed, with much labour and ingenuity, from the skin of the neck of the buffalo, sewed together in the form of large tortoises lying on their backs; to each there was a kind of drum-stick by which they were beaten, forming a sort of musical instrument for their strange dances.  By the sides of these sacks, which were called ECH-TE-KA, there were lying two other articles of equal importance, called ECK-NA-DE, rattles made of dried skins, in the form of a gourd shell, which were also used as music for the same purpose.

The chief actors in these strange scenes were eight men loosely covered with the entire skins of buffaloes with the horns and tails attached.  The dancers looked through the holes of the eyes of the skin as through a mask, and throughout preserved the horizontal position, by which they were enabled more closely to imitate the motions of the buffalo.  They were all naked, and painted in the most extraordinary manner with black, red and white paint.  Each of them had also a lock of buffalo's hair tied around the ankles. In the right hand he had a rattle and in the left hand a slender staff about six feet long; and on his back he carried a bunch of willow boughs of the ordinary size of a bunch of straw.  These eight men being divided into four couples, took their positions on the four sides of the Ark or Big Canoe; representing thereby the four cardinal points, and between each of these groups was another figure engaged in the same dance, keeping the step with the eight buffaloes and with a similar staff and a rattle, four in all.

There were, moreover, a great number of characters, who represented various animals, who added materially to the effect of this strange scene.  First, close by the side of the Big Canoe, there were two men who wore the skins of grissly bears, with the skins covering their faces as masks.  These characters, called \"grisly bears,\"  were continually growling and threatening to devour everything before them, and interfering with the forms of the ceremony.  To appease them and keep them quiet, the women were constantly bringing them dishes of meat, which were placed before them, and as often snatched away and carried to the prairies by two men called \"bald eagles,\" whose bodies and limbs were painted black, and their heads and feet white.  These in their turn were chased upon the prairies by scores of small boys, with their bodies and limbs painted yellow, and their heads"},{"pageid":66990,"pagefilename":"602dfc834a331caabe22aa201126e4cc.jpg","transcription":"15.\nand feet white, wearing a tail of white deers' hair, and, these were called \"antelopes.\"  At length they succeeded in getting hold of the dishes of meat from the bald eagles and ate it. Besides these, two men represented swans; their bodies were painted white, and their noses and feet black.  Two others men called \"rattlesnakes,\" whose bodies were curiously painted to imitate that reptile each holding a bunch of wild sage in his hands.  Two \"beavers\" were represented by two men entirely covered excepting their heads, with buffalo robes, the fur worn outside, with beaver's tails attached to their girdles.  The two \"vultures\" had their bodies naked, and their heads and shoulders painted blue.  The two \"wolves\" were painted white, and wore white wolf skins; they pursued the antelopes, and whenever they overtook one the grisly bears came up and devoured it.  All these characters very closely imitated the habits of the animals which they represented, and each had some peculiar and appropriate song, which was constantly sung and chanted during these dances.  These strictly \"medicine\" songs are kept a profound secret even from people of their own tribe, excepting such as are regularly initiated therein at an early age, and for which an exorbitant price is paid.

The beavers clapped with their tails, the beavers struck with their paws, the buffaloes rolled in the sand, or leaped on their feat, and all danced off together into an adjoining lodge where they remained in a curious and picturesque group until the master of ceremonies again summoned all the dancers and group of animals to gather round him.

But, in the midst of the last dance on the fourth day, a sudden alarm throughout the group announced the arrival of a strange character from the West. Women were crying, dogs were howling, and all eyes were turned towards the prairie, where, at the distance of a mile or so, a man was seen making his approach towards the village.

Her daughter, who was very pretty, came up to her, and the evil spirit desired her to go and bring some water, but he wished before she started that she would come to him and eat some buffalo meat.  He told her to take a piece out of his side which she did, and ate it, and it proved to be buffalo fat.  She then went for the water, which she brought, and met him and her mother in the village to which they had walked, and they both drank of it.  Nothing more took place.

Great search was made for her, before she was found, as it was expected that the child would also be 'great medicine,' and in some way be of great importance to the nation.  They were induced to this belief from the strange manner of its conception and birth, and in this they were soon confirmed from the wonderful things which it said and did from an early age. -   Amongst the miracles which it performed on an occasion when the Mandans were likely to starve, for want of a due supply of food, this child gave them four bulls, which filled the bellies of the whole nation, and there was as much meat left as there was before they began to eat, and the people were assured that these four bulls would supply them forever.  The first or only man was bent on the destruction of this child, and after making many fruitless searches for it, found it hidden in a dark place, and he put it to death by throwing it into the river.  When O-kee-hee-da heard of the death of the child, he sought for Nu-mock-muck-a-nah with the intent to kill him.

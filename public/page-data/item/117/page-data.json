Margaret had written me of her coming, and I probably would have met her in Schenectady if I had not had business in Pittsburgh which I could not put off. After some little mis-planning we finally saw each other here last Thursday -Margaret came down that evening and returned Sunday evening. It was rather a thrill to be again waiting for the arrival of one of the Everetts at the station: I knew her readily enough, although I did almost carry off another girl at first, by mistake. As soon as I can arrange it I shall see her in Schenectady, and see if she has made as desirable living arrangements as are possible. I admire her spunk in packing up and coming as she did and am sure she will make good quickly.\nWe discussed various things, aside from our delight in seeing each other (Helen and Margaret seemed to approve of one another and did more discussing, by volume, than I took part in) and among them the educational and other outlook for the family at the moment. At the risk of intruding I am going to \"make a few remarks\" which may or may not be appropos but which are surely meant well.\nI deduced from Margaret's comments and remarks that she is relied upon, or has offered, to help Mary financially this spring. I do not believe she should, but that she definitely should be enjoined from it. She is in a slightly different environment now, and must if she is to profit by it, get ahead financially if only by a tiny margin. I firmly believe she will require all that she can earn for the next twelve months to equip her properly with clothes, \"appurtenances\" and the outer panoply of inner confidence which she will inevitably require to profit by the opportunities which can be expected to appear in Schenectady or elsewhere in the east. Her health being what it is, she requires some little smoothnesses in the way of life which she only can get by having the full use of her earnings. For emergencies' and mental-ease's sake she should gradually acquire a reserve fund of at least a few dollars also.\nAs I understand the situation, Edward will be able to assume his own destiny's control (if fortune is normally good) after this school year is passed and a summer's rest. Although Margerat said nothing on this point I have somehow received the impression that for you to carry Mary through the balance of her college course will mean a lessening of the insurance and other reserves which you and mother possess or may come to have.\nI am not able to take over Mary's college expenses as I should like to. If unmarried I could do it in full, and would have volunteered to some time since. I hope to help Margaret some now: not in a direct financial way, but in helping her to opportunities for self-advancement (materially speaking) and to certain occasional relaxations, which represent financial outlay indirectly. I want to help Edward to chances to get on his feet in a material way, also, if I can. But I feel very strongly that the essential for the family is now for Margaret first, then Edward, to get on their feet financially. We have been \"poor\" too long - in the sense that we have worked without the proper tools, the proper material footing to do ourselves justice. If Margaret can be left alone for a year I believe she will establish a new sort of independence that will be worth far more than a certain number of dollars to her: Edward can do the same in a short time after graduation if he can find himself in reasonably favorable surroundings."]},{"pageid":28572,"pagefilename":"931c757934949de5fabad01ea33c3467.jpg","transcription":["All this, it would seem, cold-bloodedly disregards the youngest of the brood, Mary. Knowing that I may be open to misinterpretation, I still must say that I believe that Mary should stop college until conditions are easier. I do not believe that you and mother should deplete your resources at this time; I do not believe Margaret can help Mary or the family as a whole as much by sending money to Minnesota now as she can by spending her money for her own protection and advancement and independence; and I think Edward's best service to himself and his parents and brother and sisters is to get himself fixed firmly on his own feet as promptly as may be.\nIf, a year from now, I can send Mary $25 a month, which I am confident I can do then during her college terms, and Margaret is on her feet and can spare a few dollars a months, and Howard and Zaidee can be counted on for certain additions, won't Mary find herself able to return to college more contentedly, more independently, with more satisfaction and less of the \"poor\" feeling, than she has today? In the meantime, can't she, without demeaning or belittling or hardening herself, support herself by teaching or in some other way, and be able to return to college, when she does, with new clothes etc., etc?\nI am writing somewhat crudely I guess - partly because I am forced to write a little in haste - but I hope that I won't be misunderstood.\nCan you let me know what Mary's expenses for the balance of this school year will be?

Putnam\nMinister\nLudington, Mich.,\nJune 29, 1920.\nMy Dear Cousin Eddie:\nFor over a week I have been trying to find time and strength to write you. Perhaps I ought not to speak of the reason for delay in this manner when the real reason has been my own state of mind. It has been very hard to bring myself to do the things that were for me to do even though they were very important. Hattie entered life immortal one week ago last Sunday afternoon at five o'clock and the consequent sorrow in my own heart has stood in the way of all my normal life. I have neglected my best friends. I know I ought to have better control of myself, but it is taking time for me to get the mastery.\nWe brought her home the first week in June reaching home the 3rd. It was quite an undertaking to make the journey, but we were prospered on the trip and the precious wife was greatly cheered to be in her own home again and surrounded by her old friends. For a few days the change seemed to help her, but it was only temporary. Reaction set in and it soon became evident that she could last only a very short time. Elizabeth and her family came home and their coming also helped for a few days, but nothing in this world could hold that sweet spirit in the body. She realized that she could remain only a short time and after the situation appeared to her in the true light she wanted to go as soon as possible. She was unconscious the most of the time for several days. The final passing was quiet and without a struggle.\nI think that outside of the immediately family you knew her better than any of our other relatives. I shall never forget your association with us in our temporary home in New York. You know how brave and sweet and true her spirit was though her body was so frail. She accomplished a wonderful amount of work with very little physical strength. I do not know how I can get along without her. After a man lives in this world as long as I have he ought to be able to stand alone, but some way I feel my dependence upon that dear woman more and more as I try to face the duties and problems of life. I am thankful to have the dear daughter and her children who are with me at least for the summer. They are a great help.

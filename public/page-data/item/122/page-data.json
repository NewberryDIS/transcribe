She brought a large piece of fresh gingerbread and some molasses candy, given her by the family of one of her patients.

I hope you had my card, acknowledging your letters, also my letter sent to the General Office before yours came to me. I hope you are comfortably settled by this time, and that you have been able to get help with the washing & c. How is it with the colored woman who used to help you in that line? It is such a help to have a lift with the heavier jobs. It seems good to think of you being all together, that is all but the Father of the family, who must be \"all alonesome\" as Eva (now Elizabeth) used to say. Out in that Western region, but if we all try to make the best of it \"all things will work together for good.\" in the end.

He is a nice correspondent. Is not this Margaret's birthday? 8 years old. I can hardly realize that she is such a big girl. Four years ago today we came to this house. I think it was the 11th & not the 10th. The rose bushes in front of the house were in bloom then, and they did look so pretty, and cheering. One bush, the dark red one, nearest the parlor windows, to the left of the path, has been in bloom over a week & is now fading; the one opposite, on the right of the unclear, with pink roses, is just showing how pretty it can be, but will not bloom so freely as the dark red one. The two near the sidewalk, are smaller and will hardly give us a rose this year. They are lighter, one almost white.

There are a good many things to consider. It would be very nice to have the amount paid for rent go towards securing a home. especially if there were probability that you could remain to educate the children, and if it would be all clear gain. How are the taxes in Topeka. Brother John's were very high. But perhaps ministers are not taxed. They are not here. Father was exempt, but as soon as he was gone, Mother was assessed. It seemed hard in her old age and bereavement, but such was the law. Does one become responsible for taxes as soon as the first payment is made? Then repairs are to be considered. In buying a house one wants to be sure that much of that would not be called for right away. We had to commence shingling the first day after entering, and the expense of repairing has been very great. If you buy, look sharp to the condition of the premises. Is the cellar damp or dry? How is the roof? Are the rooms in such shape as to be convenient, and as you wish to have them remain? Is the location convenient to the schools, so that car fares would be at a minimum?

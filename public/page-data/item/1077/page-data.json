I did not enjoy the beautiful scenery as it was announced by some of the passengers as we came along side of the different islands, \"How beautiful,\" \"It is lovely on deck\" be?, which did not afford even a temptation to poor me, who was not able to leave my berth. The bay of Hilo is beautiful, but the landing is rather rough and rude, as the steamer cannot get near shore and we are landed in a whaleboat. \nI was much exhausted when I reached Mr. Forbes' house, the parsonage, as we walked up to the house, there being no carriages on this island. This is the very kind family that entertained me nearly two years ago on Maui, Lahainaluna. He is now pastor of the Foreign church here. I felt more comfortable after a few days of rest and good food, as you must know we are pretty lean after seasickness of two days and unclear taking anything into the stomach that can be retained. \nIt took me some time to get rested, as I had had a long stretch of mental and physical strain, with no relaxation. I enjoyed a quiet cozy time, just taking every thing easy, and throwing off all care, and after two weeks I felt better. The Monday following my arrival, I was invited by two native girls, who had been pupils in our school, to walk down on the beach. \nI had no idea of a very long walk, but it was very pleasant, and before I was aware of it, I had gone a long distance. I passed through a small native village with a wharf, where the steamer sometimes comes to unload freight, when the sea is too rough to land it in its usual place, quite a distance below the town. Here comes into the bay a little river, which is navigable for scows? and small boats, the short distance of half a mile. The name of this little village is Waialama. I was interested here, but still went on, till we came to a strait which separated a small rocky island from the main land. This looked inviting, and some native children"},{"pageid":72708,"pagefilename":"a42e9db705873e379a456a7ee9d1c467.jpg","transcription":"who had followed along with us, and had a horse, gave me the animal to ride across the strait, while the children swam. This island is called Cocoanut Island, because of a small cocoanut grove on it. There were plenty of shells here, but mostly beach worn. We staid some time, and found it was time to return lest our friends become alarmed. On returning, we found that the tide had risen, and I could not hold my feet high enough to keep them out of the water. Afterwards, I was told, that it is often too high, and sometimes too rough to cross. On this island is the quarantine hospital, never used but once. I felt a very pleasant tired when I got back, and they seemed be greatly surprised to find how far we had walked, it being more than two miles. I remained quiet receiving calls, and returning them, as the people here are quite social, till Saturday, when I planned an excursion with the children. We went again to the beach, through the little village, and then over to another indentation of the bay. It was also a very pretty part of the bay, and here we gathered shells and mosses. Our party consisted of four boys and two girls. They unclear fished, and gathered shells for me. I walked in the water barefoot, till my soles became very tender, as the lava rock is very sharp and rough, and the sand is mostly, worn out, and ground shells. The tops of my feet were nearly blistered by the sun. We had several showers, which were quite enjoyable as I lay stretched on the beach thoroughly absorbed in gathering shells. It is not easy to find good shells. There are thousands of shells, but beach worn mostly. We had a long walk to get back home, and my feet were very wet; the children went barefoot. I forgot to speak of two rocks, which are considered of much importance in this part of the bay, by the natives. One is a circular lava rock standing in the water like an island; the other a peninsular rock, both quite flat on the top. One is called a god, the other a goddess of sickness. This is the idea I get of their superstition. If anyone is sick, he must swim around the one several times and then get up on the other. This people are not heathen now, but the old superstitions will hang about them, and although they have renounced the adoration of such"},{"pageid":72709,"pagefilename":"148e08d693f87b3b63a933e0756084d4.jpg","transcription":"things, yet they are much influenced by them. \n\n          Tuesday, June 29, I was called for and invited to go to Onomea plantation, seven miles away to make a visit and see the grinding of sugar. As a horse and escort were provided, and I was to be ready in an hour, I soon was ready. When I am dressed and mounted for a journey I always think what would our folks say to my appearance. I will describe, as one description will answer for all. My bloomer suit is made of check, black and white flannel, trimmed with black braid. It has served me many a hard jaunt, and the wet and dry of shower and sun has shrunken it so that I must part with it. Well,  this was the dress. A pair of old shoes, as the mud and water is sometimes thrown so that we must change when we get to the end of the journey. We carry our changes in saddle bags thrown over behind, then if cloaks or umbrellas are needed they are strapped behind the saddle. With my hat tied down over my ears, sometimes with my hands and face done up in rags to keep from burning, I am ready for the journey. At 10 A.M. I was all ready, and we, Bertie Austen and myself, mounted our horses. As I am so heavy my saddle bags are usually put upon the horse that carries the lighter person. The roads were very muddy and a good, many deep parries? or gulches, made by a stream of water finding its way to the sea. I am told, that in that ride of seven miles, from Hilo to Onomea there are twenty four streams with their high banks to cross. On this island if we travel, it must be on horseback or not at all. We have here a fruit, incorrectly called Alligator Pear. It is a peculiar fruit, and weighs about one and one half pounds. Mrs. Forbes wished to send one to Mrs. Austin, and as Bertie had his hands and pockets full, I volunteered to take it in my outside dress pocket. We had not ridden far when \"alas! Lucy Locket lost her pocket\". The weight of it in galloping, had bounced it about till something must give way, and being swung behind me in riding, I did not feel it. I felt like laughing about it, though I lost with it my ring of keys and a handkerchief. I have not yet found either; am"},{"pageid":72710,"pagefilename":"4f41ba95d7432e501f9e5424e16a0ec9.jpg","transcription":"to loose the keys. We arrived at Onomea at 12 1/2 P.M. and I was warmly welcomed by Mrs. Austen and her family of six boys. I could not but feel grateful for her to take so much trouble to have me come to her place, and I a stranger. I had met her a few times during the few days I was in Hilo. On these plantations we do not often find more than one white family. If other white men are employed they usually have a native wife. After I had rested awhile, Mrs. Austin took me through the sugar mill. They were finishing up a short job of grinding. This was very interesting to me. The next day we walked up one of those deep gulches. These are simply cuts through the land, through a continued bluff from 100 to 400 feet above the sea. They are often very beautiful, though rather hard to get over, as in riding along we come to one and it is just as steep as we could possibly climb down or up. The horses are sure footed, and used to it, and get along easily, and soon did not mind it. The banks are sometimes bare rock, but usually are covered with beautiful tropical vegetation. They do not have the variegated vegetation of which you in America can boast in Autumn, yet it is variegated and lovely to look at. Ferns, small and large, are the chief and most ornamental. The change of colour is mostly owing to the age of the leaf. In some, when they first come out, they are the most delicate green, then as they advance, they change to the different shades of green, and some to a dark purple. Some when they first shoot out, are a delicate brown, then change to light green, and so they vary; and in these Onomea gulches it seems as if they did try to outshine the vegetation of other countries. We went to the head of this ravine, then down to the point of the bluff which overlooks the bay below, which, with its varied landscape surrounding it, makes it the loveliest picture of its kind I ever saw. There is the sea with its surf, beating and lashing its foam against the high, steep rocks, that shut it in. Then here is the mouth of two rivers, (so they call them) and these two gulches terminating with their beautifully bordered banks 400 feet high, and a point of bluff which ends here, as if not willing to separate the stream any longer, but they are here allowed to flow peacefully a little"},{"pageid":72711,"pagefilename":"3fac77a1d306d524e8ca6db8baa36e1f.jpg","transcription":"distance with a low strip of land between, as if allowed to look over to each other before entering the sea, where they will unite their waters and be mingled with the billows. A few native buildings and two Chinese stores are on this low point, which gives it a look of life and civilization. There we lingered till after sunset. The evenings here are like the evenings back home in July, so soft and cool; yet we need no extra clothing. I do not feel the heat here as many do. If we are too warm, and feel \"sticky\" as is often expressed, we get into a bath tub, which every house affords? few things so essential, and we are cool for the rest of the day. Many of the bath tubs are arranged with a spout from a running stream, pouring into it, and oh, what a luxury to feel the stream pouring over us, and then to paddle about, till one almost wishes to remain inside of the bathtub all the time. Thursday morning  Mrs. Austin and I went down to the beach of this bay. It was a long steep descent as it is a direct rise of 400 feet, and we were soon at the bottom, where is the fording place. There I wondered how we were to cross, but Mrs. Austin called to the native woman to come, and she to my astonishment took her on her back and was soon across, telling me to do the same. I said no, and off with shoes and stockings and waded across. When we came back the woman was ready and insisted on taking me over. As she seemed desirous of the pleasure, and Mrs. Austin pressed, I consented. She stopped and I got on her back with my arms clasped about her neck. I found it hard to hold on, and I think she found a little more than a bargain, but trembling beneath the burden, she took me safely across. She returned and brought Mrs. Austin over, easily as I would a child. After having a pleasant time we returned, climbing up the steep hill, which took all my breath to get up. Friday morning, July 2, we prepared for an excursion to the woods, to gather ferns. You must remember we all ride astride, both for our own safety, and the ease of the horse, for I think, if any of you were set down upon our roads, which are only paths, and were obliged to go a certain distance in a required time, you would groan and say it is impossible to get a horse through it with any degree of safety.

We provided lunch, but it looked like a small quantity to feed so many boys, but after arriving in the woods the man dug yams, a root resembling in look and taste an Irish potato, but in shape like a large, long, sweet potato. The native choppers were about finishing their stent for the week, and went away leaving their cooking fire by a stump, and their hut, made of sticks and leaves. The house had two rooms, and in it their bed, which is made first by laying a log across the room on the ground where the head was to rest. Then fern leaves, dry, were laid till it was quite soft and smooth , then a native mat laid over. This is the general native style of bed. The occupants each wrap in a blanket, if they need it, and thus stretch themselves, men, women, and children, all on one bed, which is often half the house. The head is usually towards the middle of the room. Well, we had this house to ourselves to sit or recline. We roasted our yams, then spread a banana leaf on the ground for a tablecloth. One leaf is from any length, to ten feet, and to two feet wide, so you see it is quite a tablecloth. The yams made an abundance for our meal, with what we had before as a dessert. We ate sitting around on the ground, and with our fingers, in primitive style. I think we all enjoyed the day very much. I did at least. I gathered some nice specimen s of ferns. The roads were very muddy most of the way, the horses going down to their knees, and it seemed as if they could never get up again without breaking their legs. We rode for several miles along a flume of water through the plantation, made for floating cane and wood to the mill. This is a substitute for carting, The descent is such as to carry cane in bundles from the extreme part of the plantation, to the mill with very little attention. There are often branches or tributaries to them, and are often carried over ravines, which makes a very high bridge or aqueduct. The water as it comes into the mill, furnishes all needed water power, also supplies the engine. The fuel for the engine is, to a great extent, supplied from the sugar cane stalks, after being ground and dried, called trosh?. We had good appetites in the woods, and better for our dinner"},{"pageid":72713,"pagefilename":"bd25bf578378fc943005b772bdd7ffe2.jpg","transcription":"at 5 P.M.  People generally, here, eat dinner in the afternoon, taking lunch in the middle of the day. Saturday morning, the family prepared to come to Hilo, to celebrate the American Independence, and attend church, as it was communion Sabbath, and Mrs. Austin and two of her boys are christian. Of course it was some work to get her six boys ready, and two others who are spending their vacation with them, as they must have changes for the Sabbath. They have a cottage to stop in, and have their meals sent to them when they come to Hilo. This is the way they do whenever they go to church, as it is too wearisome, and inconvenient, to come in Sabbath morning, and then return at night. The boys rode in advance as they chose fast riding, and Mrs. Austin and I rode at our leisure, enjoying the scenery, and each other socially. I like Mrs. Austin very much. Saturday evening it was agreed that the boys should enjoy the fireworks, and invite their neighbors, but a Hilo rain spoiled much of their fun, but we all had a good time. I think the people here generally do have when they set about it, and that is quite often. On Monday evening we, at Mr. Forbes, had fire works, which were very enjoyable, as it did not rain till the last rocket was about to be fired. The large verandas were full of neighbors and friends, of all ages, and all seemed to enjoy it very much. You see we are patriots here, and though so far from the mother land, we could easily forget ourselves for a little while, and imagine we were in the land of our birth. I spent the week thus commenced at Father Lyman's. We say Father, as he is an aged patriarch in the missionary field, and also to distinguish him from the sons living near. He has been at the head of a school for native boys, which is preparatory to the Lahainaluna College for Hawaii, for many years. He has been obliged to retire, from failing health and infirmity of age; and yet has a superintending of it, it now being carried on by an educated native man, as principal, with his assistants. On Friday, I, with the four boys and one girl who accompanied me on the cocoanut Island excursion, so I started on foot to go toRainbow Falls. It was quite muddy, but we had little trouble, save that I stepped"},{"pageid":72714,"pagefilename":"6f0fc10caccd196dc9b8b9874eb54753.jpg","transcription":"once or twice on a soft foundation, and went down. We reached the falls, intending to spend much time there, but a rain from the mountains was quite near, and we feared it might swell the streams that are fed by those mountain rains, and often makes them come down in all the fury of a mountain torrent. We ate our lunch from a table of fern leaves and rock, and soon beat a retreat. It rained until we reached home. We were wet to the skin, and I enjoyed it all the more for that. We were offered horses to go with, as it was quite a long walk, but I had two objects in view in walking; I wished to prepare my muscles for the volcanic trip which I expected soon to take; Then I did not  know of a better opportunity of enjoying such a pleasure with the children. The day following I was invited with Mother Lyman, to dine at Mr. Rufus Lyman's. After dinner Mrs. Lyman went with me to call on the family of the native principal of the school afore spoken of, as the wife had been a member of our school. We went through the grounds and house. The boys were well behaved, and respectful. They were blacking their shoes, sewing on buttons, mending &c, for Sunday. One teacher lives in the building, and looks after the boys generally. Tuesday morning July 13, at 5 1/4 A.M. Mr. Hitchcock and little son, ten years old, his sister in law and myself were all mounted on picked horses, with Mexican saddles, saddle bags, umbrellas, waterproofs &c, strapped behind, and were off for a volcanic tripp, It was a long ride of thirty miles and we proposed to start early and have the cool of the day, on our own account and on account of the animals. We started off at a pretty good gallop, and soon came to the woods, seven miles long. Here, we found some oheas, A Hawaiian Mountain fruit which is very refreshing. I ate one, and that, with riding so soon after an early breakfast, made me sick. I could not eat a mouthful of lunch as we stopped to rest the horses, and refresh ourselves by the wayside, standing in wet grass and water. There are few houses, and they are of the rudest kind, and of the true native style, with fleas, cats, dogs &c, and we chose the open air."},{"pageid":72715,"pagefilename":"d7424a504baeee24f90e08ff0f59e0b2.jpg","transcription":"We had not burned as it was cloudy, and even rainy most of the way. We arrived at the Volcano at 1 1/2 P.M. and were lame and tired. We rested and had dinner, and at 3 P.M. started to go down into the crater. We could see from the Volcano House, looking down into it, the whole surface of the crater. seven miles in diameter, circular, and one thousand feet deep. Then the great black floor with terraced walls, marking the different periods of depression. At times, it is filled up for months, then again for years, and all at once, in a moment of time. it will fall one hundred or more feet, sometimes leaving a precipitous ledge, then perhaps at another time, another of smaller diameter is left, and so on, until it has the appearance of terraced banks, and is quite difficult of descent. As I looked down into this great, deep, black crater, I found that my idea of a volcano, was of a very different character than this. Instead of volumes of fire and lava shooting up heaven high, only now and then a little streak of smoke was blown about, and reminded me of the smouldering remains of a thoroughly burned fallow ground. No fire to be seen. We must go quite near it to see it. This crater is on the side of the mountain. The crater is four thousand five hundred feet high, with the floor three thousand five hundred feet or one thousand feet depression. The mountain is fourteen thousand feet high. There is a crater on its summit, which is sometimes active. I had no thought of going into the crater that day, but I was not going to be left out. We began to descend those almost perpendicular walls, and I almost groaned from pain of sore muscles from my ride. But applying the rule \"like cures like\", and ere I reached the bottom the soreness was nearly gone. I became so interested that I forgot all  fatigue. We soon reached the floor of the largest active crater in the world. We felt the heat from beneath, as we walked over this ever changing abyss, and soon came to where we could see fire just below us in the cracks, and put in our sticks, and they instantly took fire. On we walked, gaining interest and losing fear. We passed cones that had ceased to be vents, and others that were roaring and dashing liquid fire. One was a cataract"},{"pageid":72716,"pagefilename":"e3b9699f2ca4642ff6f8528621121293.jpg","transcription":"of liquid fire, another a whirlpool, each flowing at a rapid rate. The heat was so intense, that to go near enough to look down into, or to stand for a moment near it, was to burn our clothes, singe our hair, and blister our skin. We knew not how thin the crust that held us above this fearful cauldron beneath us. We took a hat, held it up before our faces, and ran as near as we dared, to take a peep into the pit. The heat was fearful, and the sight terrible. We made our way onward through steam, smoke, and so much sulphurous gases, keeping to the windward as much as possible. Sometimes we held our breath and for a moment shut our eyes, while we rushed through a jet of gas or smoke. We came to an elevation which was made of blistered, glassy, crisping, congealed lava, and this was the outer formation of another inner depression. We soon found ourselves standing on the edge of another perpendicular, broken lava bank, and overlooking three lakes of liquid, boiling, foaming, seething fire. This was a wonderful sight! The guide said we could not go to them. Mr. Hitchcock had been here many times, and was a persevering, energetic man, and soon found a place of descent. It was dangerous descending, but we were down at last, and standing within five or six feet of the edge of the middle lake, whose liquid red surface was only thirty or forty feet below us. It was so hot that we had to turn and cool our faces; and under our feet was so hot as to oblige us to keep stepping. We stood sometime at this lake, which is called Kilauea Keike, which means child of the Kilauea. This was much like the other, but much larger. There is a current underneath the surface, that connects with the three lakes, and we were walking over it. My pen fails to describe, and words are weak. When I have done my best it is a tame picture. We staid as long as we could, as we must get to the Volcano House before dark. We had walked"},{"pageid":72717,"pagefilename":"d0ea013c910f07e7b8afb1f518114513.jpg","transcription":"seven miles in all, afer our long ride. I was some tired when we got to the top but did not rest very well, it being damp in the house, from the steam, constantly coming out of the cracks in the ground all about the house. The water they used is condensed steam, impregnated with sulphur and other minerals. We were surprised that Mr. and Mrs. Peebles had got there when we got back. They were friends who started later, not thinking to go through in a day. We all had wet clothes and it was cold. We sat around a fireplace, by a wood fire, but did not keep warm. As soon as it was dark the volcano lighted up its reflection on the clouds, and bright spots about here and there. Mr. Hitchcock studied the different points and laid his plans for the next day. Before breakfast we went about to see the steam cracks and sulphur banks. The steam comes up and as it is more or less impregnated, leaves crystals and forms comes of sulphur, gypsum &c. After breakfast we started again for the crater. We took no guide this time. Mr. and Mrs. Peebles and their guide went with us. We went direct towards the lakes and Mr. Hitchcock brought us to the flowing lava which oozes out of cracks and seams, or bursts a place for itself. Here we dipped out the flowing lava with our sticks, and imbedded silver pieces as specimans. Here it is exactly like melted ore in an iron mill, but hundreds of times larger quantity. It flows slowly, and soon crusts over, a hard, black surface, and will bear the weight of a man, if he could stand the heat. We went to what we supposed was the very point upon which we stood the night before, and to our astonishment we saw only two lakes where were three, and we seemed farther away. We were looking about to satisfy ourselves that the pit had filled and overflowed and crusted; and where we had stood on the elevation above had crumbled off, so that we were really twenty or thirty feet farther away than when standing there before. All at once Keike began to break her crust and boil up, and splash and dash, assuring us that she"},{"pageid":72718,"pagefilename":"d96c97017c15858f45231cb66ff8c850.jpg","transcription":"was still there and able to move. In about one minute of time the whole surface had broken and it sunk to nearly its original depths. Then it showed itself in various ways. Of course we could not go down to where we had walked the day before, nor even near the third lake Hale-mau-mau, for the gases were blown in just that direction. We were now held in the distance for our views. We gathered Pele's hair. This is the lava as it is blown into glassy hairs, like the hairing of maple sugar, and lodges on the banks. (Pele is the goddess of volcanos, and when angry tears out her hair.) The Peebles here left us, feeling fraid for their efforts, but not adequate to the rambling and exploring that we should do. We went on, and over, and up, and down everything we came to, where it did seem impossible to get over. We visited banks which had been beautiful but delicate formations of sulphur and other solidified minerals. We spent nearly all day, and went over places I doubt if women ever go. When we got back to the Volcano House, they said we had walked twelve miles, and I thought we had. On our way out, we came down on what seemed to be a recent flow of lava. It was so hot we could scarcely walk; we had to go fast to keep our feet from burning. At night we looked over into the crater, and the fire at the lakes was very active, being thrown up in splashes like hot boiling sugar, or pudding, so high as to see it very distinctly from the house, which must have been seventy or eighty feet. The reflected light too was more brilliant, and , just below us to our surprise, just where we had been walking over that hot crust only a few hours before, was a great river of flowing lava, and in an hour more, the crust broke into one mass of flowing, liquid lava, covering hundreds of acres. We were treated to a roasted pig standing on all fours on the plate, for our dinner, after which we took a steam bath. A rude house is built over the hot sulphur crack, and a box arranged so that you get in and sit with your head just out of the top, your neck enclosed like a persons feet in stocks. A pipe from the steam crack communicates"},{"pageid":72719,"pagefilename":"0dee499e4c6e174ece80ada78e70e88a.jpg","transcription":"with the box, and has a valve with which to regulate the heat. This is said to take out the aches, but I did not experience much relief. I felt refreshed but not healed. We rose early the next morning, and at 6 A.M. were ready to gallop off towards Puna, on our way home: which is thirty eight, or forty miles ride, in one day. This is a hard, rough road over pahoehoe and a-a. These are the names of two distinct kinds of lava. There, going down the steep side of the mountain, and along the plain, we could see the different lava flows, ancient and recent, and of every formation. We stopped at noon to rest ourselves and our horses at the house of a very respectable native: near the seashore, where was one of the principal places of destruction, at the time of the terrible earthquake and tidal wave in 1868. There the ground rose, then sunk, and the sea came in and swept scores of people, houses, gardens, cattle &c, into the sea. Many lives were lost, and where was a little village on the beach, is now under water. The rock near is broken so abruptly, that it looks unclear if cut. A vast sandbank was also washed up. The wave was destructive, more or less, all around the island. There were outbursts from the mountain; a mud flow, and lava. The volcano had been inactive for a long time, and at this time, showed terrible spasms of rage, and the natives felt that Pele, was showing her powers of rage. Many christian natives, united in prayer with other christians, all day and all night, till it ceased, and many a praying band were saved while exposed to imminent danger, and could not stay in their houses, or even under the trees, lest they be crushed. The ground was shaken and rent in many places. We arrived at Puna, Capt. Eldents, about 5 P.M. It had been a long, wearisome, journey, and as a quietus for our fatigue, we must walk a long half mile; to me, it seemed like a mile and a half; to a warm sulphur spring for a bath. We did not bathe long, but came back refreshed for our supper. Food relished here, better than it had elsewhere since we left home; I slept better too. We were to rest here all day, and we"},{"pageid":72720,"pagefilename":"749caf40609ad143d1466614eeb5c832.jpg","transcription":"bathed again, spending nearly two hours in the water. The spring is in a crevice of rock, and rises and falls with the tide. It is about thirty feet long, twelve feet wide, and twenty feet deep, and as clear as water can be. We can see everything in the bottom. It magnifies strangely, and persons swimming look very funny. (The water is very buoyant, and one cannot sink, by diving very deep.) We all had our bathing clothes. I could swim like a piece of lead. The others were expert swimmers. When we came out, we found that our lameness, and burns were nearly well. We had planned to go to another spring, in a cave, where we should crawl through a hole to get in, and swim by candle light. A shower prevented us, as it was a mile and a half farther. Here, at Puna, are many interesting volcanic appearances. Beautiful hills thrown up, and a crater in the top, all grown over with grass and shrubs. On one, is a lake, called Green Lake, from its color. We did not ramble any more, thinking it best to rest. My eyes were swollen nearly shut, from the heat and burn at the volcano. The next morning we were delayed till 12 o'clock, as two of our horses were lame, and not fit to come home, through injuries received in consequence of shoeing improperly for such a journey. The lava roads are fearful for horses feet. The fresh horses must be caught, and shod, during which time we went again to the spring, and staid an hour or more. This made us all fresh for our last days ride of twenty three miles, to Hilo, where we arrived at \n2 1/2 P.M. I was a looking sight. My face was red as it could be, my eyes swollen nearly shut, my neck, and even the part in the top of my head, was blistered. We were not very tired, now that we were used to riding. I took a walk after supper, the same night. We had been away from Thursday, 5 A.M., till Saturday 5 P.M., and had accomplished as much as is often done in that length of time. Sunday, I rested my eyes, and Monday, was invited to join a little party, to ride about five miles, to Pepe Falls. The roads are very muddy and rough, so we took our time.

The water does not, ordinarily, run over the top of this pot, but finds its way through a subterranean passage, boiling up to the surface from the bottom. There are six such pots, and are called boiling pots. We climbed down as near to them as we could. We enjoyed our lunch, in the shade of the rocks, with leaves for our table, beside the coolest and sweetest water I have tasted in a long time. On our way down, we stopped at Rainbow Falls, the same I visited with the children. This is a fall of about one hundred feet, and throws off spray, which sometimes reflects a rainbow; hence its name. These ravines, pools, and falls are mostly formed and left by volcanic actions. The following Thursday, the twentieth, I was invited to repeat my visit to Onomea. It was a pleasant ride, and as I had enjoyed the scenery, the air , and the visit generally, I was very glad to go, and enjoyed it equally as well as before. Friday, Mrs. Austin and the boys, took me to ride out to a newly planted cane field. We had one deep gulch to cross and then we had a beautiful unclear We went up the stream some distance, and crossed the same stream on a bridge over the top of a high waterfall. It was a frightful looking place. The bridge is built to convey cane across, saving much distance and luggage, as from there it is carried in a flume. I returned on Saturday to Hilo, having enjoyed my visit very much. I was invited today, the 30th, to go again with a pleasant party, to Coconut Island, but thought it best to decline, much as I would like to go. Aug. 12. I am now in Lahainaluna, at the Rev. L.E. Bishop's. I will resume my pen. Aug.13. Mrs. Coan and I, walked out to the mouth of the Wailuku river to the beach. We found it necessary to hasten, as there was a shower coming. We found the tide high, but we gathered some mosses, and hurried home. This was the last excursion, as the next day I took the steamer for Lahaina. I was soon very sick, but got over it, so as to be able to be on deck lying down, and saw much of the formation of Hawaii, which is wholly volcanic. I saw where the more recent flows had been; and the curious formation of the lava in"},{"pageid":72722,"pagefilename":"f310558d69b626d94e5430db751fb75f.jpg","transcription":"bubbles, leaving holes, caves, bridges &c. When we came to Kealakekua Bay. I went ashore in a whale boat to see Capt. Cook's monument, erected in 1874 I think, as near the spot where he was killed as could be. I was told, that when his ship lay him there in the bay, 30,000 natives came to the shore to see them, and there is now only one family of natives for miles around there. The high, steep bank, is very steep, and full of bubble holes, and they told me that the chiefs were formerly buried there in those holes.    Aug. 14. Left Lahainaluna yesterday at 7 1/2 A.M., and landed at Honolulu at about 8 P.M.. His majesty, the king, was on board and I had a little conversation with him, as I lay quite near his royal. movable bed. He gave me some ice to cool my mouth, as I was quite sick. While at Lahainaluna, where I spent a week on my way home, I enjoyed a pleasant visit, and had one ramble up the beautiful valley, whence comes the watercourse which is so deceiving to me, in having the appearance that the water, that is conducted for a long distance along the precipitous side, Approximately next 12 words UNCLEAR due to degradation of paper dry on their side of the island.

We went up for exercise, to come to woods, and cool breezes, and wonderful precipices. I am now at my work in the school, having had a vacation that has been profitable and pleasant, and by God's preserving care, I have been carried through dangers, and narrow escapes, been permitted to endure severe hardships, that I might witness His wonderful works, and return refreshed in body and mind. I wish as many of my friends as care to, and can, to have the benefit of it, by passing it among them.

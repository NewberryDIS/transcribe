Tery. Sept. 17th 1841.\nHon. John Bell: -\nSir, Though I have not the honor of a personal acquaintence with you, I hope I shall not be considered an intruder. If I venture to suggest a few things relative to matters & things upon this frontier, in which I concieve you to be interested, as they lie principally within the province of the Dept. over which you preside. I am aware that you derive much & valuable information from the numerous officers, dependant upon your Dept. but still my residence in this country for some years and my personal acquaintence with the country for 500 miles above this by the course of River, may enable me to suggest some things which have not occured to their minds.\nThe first thing that strikes the observing mind, here, is the rolling tide of emigration, & the consequent rapid settlement of \"the West,\" together with the encroachments these settlements are making upon the habitations of the Aborigines or original Lords of the soil. And as these are properly the wards of your Dept. it is in refereance to them & their final destiny, that I wish principally to direct your attention. other matters being only incidentally connected therewith. \nIf you will spread a map of the United States before you, & cast your eye along the Allegheny Mountains, you see at once the most general line of demarkation between the whites & the red men of the forests, as it stood 50 years ago. Since then, a population of 4,000,000, have increased to 17,000,000, who have peopled 11 states in the west & Maine & Vermont in the east. Making 13, besides 3 Territories - equil to one state, & western Penn. & Virginia equil to another. In all equil to 15 states. Upon the same ratio of increase 17,000,000, will so increase as to settle upwords of 60 states in 50 years to come. But when you estimate the entire extent of the U. S. Tery. west of the new states, you will find territory enough for only about 28 states in the size of Penn.y. and consequently, our ratio of increase for 50 years past if it continues (& no one doubts it) will fill up or settle the whole Ter'y, to the Pacific Ocean in about 20 or 25 years"]},{"pageid":55280,"pagefilename":"2cd98684ec57b8184d0ede792bfdddbb.jpg","transcription":["But we have half a million of Indians to be provided for, & allowing the present policy of the Govt. in forming them into Indian Territories, of say 100,000, it will require an end equil to 5 states for them to occupy.  This will reduce the Territory to be settled by the whites, to equil about 23 states, which, of course, according to the past ratio of increase will fill up in less than 20 years.  And when thus filled or settled by the whites, we shall have the Indians in close juxtaposition, throughout the entire west.  And if they are unimproved, or remain in a savage state, or follow the chase for a living, they must in the nature of things be troublesome, because the Districts allowed them cannot be sufficient to furnish them game, & they must of consequence depredate upon the whites, or starve.  If they steal, it will lead to war, which may end in their extermination, but if we press them into so narrow limits as to cause them to steal for a subsistance & then exterminate them for doing it, as a Nation, we incur fearful responsibilities, & the judgements of God will, no doubt, redress the grievances of the oppressed.\nBut I have not the most distant idea, that either the Gov't or people of the U.S. desire or design any such measures.  But possibly the rapid settlement of the west, is hastening the period at which the benevolent & guardian designs of the Gov't. to provide for their permanent settlement & civilization will need to have been accomplished faster than is generally thought of, & hence the propriety of more extensive & efficient efforts in this great & noble scheme.\nWhat I would suggest on this subject, is, the propriety of selecting those points at which Indian Territories are to be formed, & District off the whole country to the Pacific by Act of Congress, into future states, and then as fast as may be, collect the Indians within the Dists assigned to them, & let a great portion of the price of the lands bought of them, be applied to the benevolent purpose of teaching them the civilized arts, and at the same time allow & encourage the religious community to supply them with missionaries.  Indeed, the efforts of Govt. have in no case succeeded so well in civilizing the Indians, as when done thro' those men who go among them - not for the emoluments of office, as some do, who care not a"]},{"pageid":55281,"pagefilename":"df5ef08cb61c761c4604177cb2b6dd7b.jpg","transcription":["straw whether the object of Gov't. is accomplished or not, & who are too often men of idle & dissolute habits - but from principles of benevolence, whose object is not gained unless they see the Indian bettered in his moral & phisical condition.\nIndeed it is a matter of fact, & susseptable of the clearest proff that Christianity, I mean than renovation of our natures commonly called conversion, civilizes an Indian at once.  Hence the great change in the Wyandotts, the Chippewas in Canada, the Cherokees, Chocktaws, &c in the South and several of the lessor tribes in the Western Territory.  With such indisputable facts before them, it must be the policy of Gov't. wishing to civilize the Indian, to encourage & sustain the missionary, or at least use them where it can be, in preference, to accomplish its objects, in the premises.\nThe splendid scheme, at this moment, being brought into opperation, by you, thro' Gov. Doty on the St. Peters, will no doubt do much in this matter, but whether the limits of the contemplated Territory, are struck out so as not to clash with the white settlements, or not, I am not apprised.  The country east of the Mississippi to its sourse & thence to the British line, is claimed by Wiskonson under the Ordinance of 1787, dividing the Tery. N. W. of Ohio into 5 states, and should the Govt design to extend the St. Peters Ind. Tery. east of said River, some altercation might, at a future day, grow out of it, unless it was done by consent of the people, in accordance with the provisions of the said Ordinane of 1787.  This consent of Wiskonson can be more readily obtained in one way, than in any other, if it can be obtained at all.  That is, if Congress will take some measures to induce Michigan to recede that portion of her state which lies west of Green Bay, & south of Lake Superior.  The people of Wis. feel not well pleased with the measure adopted, which took from our natural limits a district equil to some of the smaller states, & gave it to a state from which it is severed by natural boundaries, and to regain that country, I think, from what I learned in the Legislation the people would consent to lose that portion of the Tery. which lies west of a line drawn from the bend of the River 8 miles"]},{"pageid":55282,"pagefilename":"dc7ceaeee1bb20b390a7e3aec5fd2012.jpg","transcription":["east of Fort Snelling, nearly north to the head of the lower falls of the St. Louis River, head of Lake Superior, & north of that Lake.  Such a line, if run soon would leave all the white settlements east of it.  But if delayed long, the whites will be west of it.  It would leave nearly or quite the entire waters of the St. Croix within this Tery. & the wates of Rum River within the Ind. Tery.  It would give the whites access to the harbor at Fon du Lac (the head of L. Superior) & the water fall on the St. Louis river which empties into it.\nWhether this plan be adopted or not, I respectfully suggest the importance of a Fort at Fon du Lac, & a military road from it to Fort Snelling, a distance, not to excede 150 miles over good ground & near or on the proposed line most of the way.  If, then, the Chippewas should be moved into the country west & north of Lake Superior, the country bordering & south of that Lake would soon settle by the whites.  There are many inducements for its settlement.  The soil is very rich & abounds in mineral resoures, timber, &c, and the fisheries would soon be of equil if not superior value to those of Newfoundland: and what is a fact, but little know, the climate is equil to that of New England two degrees farther south, owing, probably, to its being less elevated above the levil of the sea.\nA Fort at Fon du Lac, would tend to keep the Ind. in subjection, could intercept & cut off any attempts of the British to induce them to hostilities, would induce a white settlement by affording protection, could be supplied by ships from Fort Brady, and with one provision in a treaty of peace between the Sioux & Chippewas, could prevent hostilities between those two tribes - that is, have them agree that when one of either tribe killed one of another, the murderer should be given up to the tribe of the murdered for punishment, this provision to be carried into effect by United States troops, on complaint being entered.  I am convinced, from an intercourse of some years with the Indians, that they would agree to such a stipulation & that it would be effetual in preserving peace among them.  This done, those two tribes could live in the same Tery. & under the same Govt., but not otherwise."]},{"pageid":55283,"pagefilename":"c018cdc1bfe5a58fec48aedc4df9b470.jpg","transcription":["In addition to this, if the Chippewas are settled in the District indicated, and their friendship secured by proper annuities & wholsome regulations, their brethren within the British dominions will not be likely to make war upon them or the Govt. under which they live, and are at peace: but many of them would remove within our borders for the benefits of civilization.  And it is known that if suitable encouragements are held out, hundreds of the half breeds will move within our limits for the same purpose.  While I was in charge of the Methodist Missions in that region, some 60 or 70 half breeds expressed a whish to form a settlement on the east side of the River near the mouth of Crow Wing, for this very purpose.  And I and told that hundreds of others would follow in their train.  Both Chippewas & Sioux, to my knowledge are favourable to civilization.  A circumstance of recent occurance shows this in unequivocal language.  Wa-ke-ah-tun-kah (Big Thunder) previous to Gov. Dotys late treaty with the Sioux, thinking that war between his tribe & the Chippewas was to be perpetual, & knowing that Christianity & civilization rendered men less disposed for war than the savage state, opposed the missionary, because as he said \"the young men if educated will not be so good soldiers.\"  But as soon as the treaty with Gov. Doty was concluded he said \"now that my young men are to become citizens & do business like the whites, I wish them to be educated,\" and desired the school to be continued.\nMany of the half breeds are but little advanced in the civilized arts, but yet enough so to feel a stronger disposition for it than do the full bloods.  And in may instances the half breed Sioux & Chippewas have intermarried & mixed.  And it is thought that if they could have a district assigned them between the Sioux & Chippewas, that it would contribute greatly to the preservation of peace between those tribes: and as a half breed is known to have great influence over his brethren of full blood, it is thought, that such a settlement of them among or near the full bloods, would do much to induce the full bloods to cultivate the civilized arts.\nThe boundaries of this new Tery. I concieve to be of considerable importance to the success of the project in view."]},{"pageid":55284,"pagefilename":"0bc54a0a95ee5ce62000331469f12e18.jpg","transcription":["If its eastern boundary is to be the Mississippi, by casting your eye upon the map north of St. Peters, you will see a large bend of the river to the west, which through one of the finest agricultural & mineral countries of this region west of what I suppose will be the capital of Tery. - St. Peters.  And the white settlement which may & will be formed there in a few years, nearer to St. Peters than to Lake Superior, will, of course seek an outlet for trade by way of the River to St. Peters.  This will bring them in contact with the Indians; & as such contact, at first, has invariably viciated rather than improved the morals & habits of the natives, the same may be expected in this case and so far as this influence goes, it will thwart the benevolent purposes of the Govt. in the premises.  The Indians are accustomed to traversing the river & water courses, & it will be an age before they can be changed in this habit, if ever.  And if they occupy one side of the River & the whites the other, contact will be inevitable.  Besides, if the Indian is left in full possession of the river, upon which he has glided from childhood with the native freedom of the ducks & geese which breed upon them, he will be more likely to be content with the proposed change in his social & civil relation.  But if the proposed inland line should be adopted, including a neutral district each side of it over which niether white or red should pass, without permission, all those difficulties wold be obviated.\nIn fixing the southern boundary of the Tery. the claims of Iowa, in regard to its state limits, must be considered, and to fix this advantageously to all concerned, the localities of the country should be considered.  If Iowa should extend as far north as the 44 deg. N. Lat. the cressent bend of the St Peters River, at which point it is proposed, (as I am informed) to settle the Winnebagoes, will be but a few miles from the Iowa line, and as part of the tributaries of the St. Peters, from the south, will come from within the State of Iowa, the Indians may assend them beyond their limits, or the whites may decend them for the purposes"]},{"pageid":55285,"pagefilename":"f5340a23e5c4f4bbe5a9118f4f8fb154.jpg","transcription":["of trade.  This would bring the two colors into contact, & to the same disadvantage as before mentioned.  But from the map, (I use Judsons map of Wis. & Iowa) it appears that 43 1/2 deg N. Lat. would leave all the waters of the St. Peters river within the proposed Ind. Tery. & consequently avoid the difficulties arrising from the conact of the two colors.\nOn the western boundary, I should suppose, the North Red River with its tributaries should come within the Tery.  If the map is any way near correct the 20 1/2 deg. W. Long. from Washington will be about the point.  Farther west would take in some of the tributaries of the Missouri, & farther east would leave out some of the tributaries of Red River.  One object, in the premises, not to be lost sight of, is, the half breeds of the Selkirk Red River Settlement are inclining to migrate to within our country.  Many of the whites have done so, & settled on the west side of the St. Croix Lake, & others are expected to follow.  The half breeds, it is said, prefer our country, & if settled within our limits and their friendship secured, they would form a barrier to the invation of the British from that quarter in case of war.  The great thoroughfare for all this imigration from that region to our limits, is on the Red River, hence the propriety of that River being within the Tery.  I am told that the Red River half breed, would prefer to settle on the Red River, while those along Lake Superior would probably prefer to settle west or N. West of the Lake.\nIf it be found impracticable to unite the Sioux & Chippewas in one Tery. & under one Govt. or Superintendency, perhaps the best remedy for the evil would be the establishment of two Tery; one for each, with such other bands as would unite with them.  The seat of Govt. for one at St. Peters & the other at Fon du Lac.\nIt will be seen that the proposed western boundary will leave sufficient Tery. for the formation of states, including the Missouri River.  And as that River must be the great thoroughfare to the Oregon Tery. a chain of white states should be formed along that water course.\nI have already extended this letter far beyond my original intention; but there is one point more on which I wish to touch, & which my own observation has proved to be of vital importance to the objects contemplated by the Govt."]},{"pageid":55286,"pagefilename":"deeda7c46721e58f27aea46d5695dedd.jpg","transcription":["that is, the characters of the Gov. Superintendants or other kind of agents, who are to carry out the benevolent views of the Govt. in these matters.  I have known men in there offices who are skeptical as to the propriety or even posibility of civilizing the Ind's.  They are generally men of immoral habits & care for nothing further than to keep fair accounts with the Dept.  Nothing can be more obvious, than that men of benevolent views & feelings, who would enter upon the discharge of such duties under the full conviction of its propriety and importance as well as practicability, would succede to better advantage than those of other views & practices.\nWhite men of good character & qualifications for such stations, will nor forego the priviledges of civilized life, for such an office, unless they are actuated by benevolent motives toward, the Indians.  Hence the most of Ind. farmers have been of idle & dissolute habits; the Ind's. have become disgusted with them & the project for their improvement has proved a failure.  But there has not been an instance of failure, of the kind, however, where the men employed have been of pious as well as moral & industrious habits.

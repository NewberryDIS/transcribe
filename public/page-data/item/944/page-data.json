The new form resembles that of a snow-plough, & it must act by partially lifting what it comes in contact with, & then throwing it off to the right or left, as it may happen.  This cow-plough, though evidently superior to any contrivance for picking up or catching the cow, does not always do it's work.  Not far from the town of Jackson, we came up with one of these poor animals that happened to be lying on the rails.  On this occasion the plough went over it, & so did the first two or three carriages; til at last the unhappy brute got fast fixed among the springs & wheels of the car I was in.  The train was stopped & the cow taken out, which though horribly mangled, proved to be still alive.  The conductor called out for the loan of a pistol to enable him to put it out of its misery.  In an instant, almost from every window on that side the train a hand was extended offering the desired instrument.

It seems a greater invasion than that of the Roman Empire by their Fathers.  That overthrew the Empire, & for a time disorganized society, however it did not extend the language of the Fatherland into Italy, Spain, or France.

It gives them a dignity & a bearing they wd not otherwise possess.

These are good effects which the American system has upon those also who are most humbly placed.

There is no writing from copies which children generally get through as quickly as they can without any attention or thought.  Singing is carefully taught.

It is not to be expected that children, when they leave school will keep up their reading, if they have not been taught to read with facility, & so far to understand what they read as to take an interest in it.\nThe key to the success of these schools, as of so many other city schools in America, is that they are graded, & that each grade has a room & teacher exclusively to itself. \nThe whole time of the teacher is devoted to one class.

How often when I have been suffering from extreme nervousness this winter have I felt that I would give almost anything to have the soothing influence of your physical presence.  Josephine was a dear good wife but her physical presence had no such effect upon me.  Our physical natures must be almost perfectly adapted to each other & may it not be that our souls are also.

If we have comfortable health I think our farm will support us.  I have just called on Charles & Ellen.  They were feeling unpleasantly about their housekeeping arrangements.  I think they have had unpleasant thoughts towards each other if nothing else.  Charles & Ellen with Ellens wishes as I understand decided to board at the Hotel.  In a few days Ellen got sick of it & wanted to keep house.  I advised Charles not to commence keeping house till he had decided what to do for if he did not remain in La Porte it would make it bad for him..  The next time I saw Charles he had hired a small house which Ellen seemed pleasant with & they went to work to get ready to keep house.  Charles & Ellen thought the back kitchen would not do so Charles decided to haul it down & rebuild which well cost him some 15 or 20 dollars. He paid his rent out month in advance.  He got his lumber & nails & he & the carpenter had commenced & hauled down the old kitchen & were putting up the new.  He also got a man to whitewash the house.  Now Ellen has heard of another house which she likes better & is perfectly disgusted with the first house.  Charles don't know what to do.  She tells him she is homesick etc.  I don't know how it will come out.  I greatly fear for him for as I understand he is nearing a point where his funds will be exhausted.  I wish you & Mary would write him a good cheerful letter.  He says he has been looking for letters from you for a long time.  Don't on any account hint anything I have said.  It will only make matters worse.  I should not have written what I have only you wrote me something relative to them in your last.

Don't start unless the weather is pleasant.  I insist on this.  Be careful & not so bundle the \n(along the side)\nbaby face as to keep him from getting a plenty of fresh air.

Madoc procured a few ships, furnished them with abundance of provisions, and he and his friends embarked and sailed westward, in search of some unknown land where they might live in peace. This occurred about 1170.  After sailing for some months, they discovered a large tract of country apparently very fertile - they landed, cut down trees, and built houses, cultivated the land etc.  Madoc was very anxious that his friends at home should know of the pleasant country he had discovered, He returned to Wales with a few of his people, from whence he sailed with ten ships, filled with men, women, live stock etc.  - nothing more is known of him.  The part of the world that Madoc discovered was in all probability a part of the vast continent of America which the Spaniards claim the merit of first finding out.  The accounts of many recent travellers confirm this opinion, and so frequently have words been detected resembling the Welsh, among a certain tribe of American"},{"pageid":72695,"pagefilename":"23a1c851512a85f0d23b864468dfce49.jpg","transcription":"Indians, that these people have been styled \"Welsh Indians\".  The great body of the people which are supposed to be Welsh Indians inhabit the country on the upper branches of the Missouri.  They are generally called White Indians or Padoucas - Lieutenant Roberts's account of an interview which he had with an Indian Chief is very curious.  \"In the year 1801\" says he \"being at Washington in America, I happened to be at a hotel smoking my cigar, according to the custom of the country, and there was a young lad (a native of Wales) a waiter in the house, who displeased me by bringing me a glass of brandy and warm water instead of cold.  I said to him jocosely, in Welsh \"I'll give thee a good beating\"  There happened to be at the same time in the room one of the secondary Indian Chiefs, who, on my pronouncing these words, rose up in a great hurry stretching forth his hand at the same time - The chief said that it was likewise his language, and the language of his father and his mother and of his nation. I said to him \"So it is the language of my father and mother and of my country\" Upon which the Indian began to enquire from whence I came? I replied \"From Wales\" but he had never heard a word about such a place.  I explained that Wales was a principality in a Kingdom called England.  He had heard of England and of the English, but never of such a place as Wales.  I asked him if there were any traditions among them, from whence their ancestors had come - He said there were and said that they had come from a far distant country\n/*reviewed CDM Dec 2018*/"},{"pageid":72696,"pagefilename":"77c94ffe13365fba70dc70b62d98d5b9.jpg","transcription":"very far in the east, and from over the great waters.

Among the great variety of accounts of the Welsh Indians, formerly collected, some of them point out a tribe of them agreeing with the above; but the main body of this people is represented as situated at a very great distance from this, as we conceive, a detached party; their country being on the upper branches of the Missouri, coming from the S.W. and are\n/*reviewed CDM Dec 2018*/"},{"pageid":72697,"pagefilename":"e21a6f6be4406bf3e2745be8f4c953e4.jpg","transcription":"generally denominated [underlined] Padoucas or [underlined] White Padoucas in late maps: but in some early maps they are called [underlined] Matocantes.

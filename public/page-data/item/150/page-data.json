The action of the Gymanfa is its sessions at Tabernacle, Scranton in September, 1916, was endorsed by the Quarterly Meeting held at Wilkes-Barre, June 9, 1917, and the original Committee was urged to go on with the project. They called representatives of the Churches to meet at Pittston to discuss the question and to receive suggestions, and in this meeting a number of able men were asked to co-operate with them, and we hereby acknowledge our gratitude to Mr. Oliver Rhydderch of Edwardsville and Mr. Gomer Rees of Plymouth for their work and labor of love. This work is the result of our conferences and deliberations. We have endeavored to avoid surplus matter in its preparation. We sought a Hymnal not to adorn our pews, but to serve our Congregations in their devotion and worship, quality not quantity has been our motto. We have attempted to retain the tunes that bear the characteristics of the Welsh people, and have yoked them to the best available English Hymns so that the younger generations may learn and sing the Hymns and tunes that have been the means of such rich spiritual blessings to their ancestors, and have marked the nation as being one of the foremost in their Congregational singing. It will be a valuable connecting link between the past, present, and future generations. It will contain not less than 140 of the best tunes of present and past composers and over 400 of the choicest Hymns suitable for all seasons and occasions in the Christian year. It will be published in two bindings and sold for 50 and 75 cents respectively. It will also contain several commendable features that are to be found in the leading Hymnals of the larger denominations in this and in the old country, such as the Apostle's Creed, the Congregationalists declaration of faith, the ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer and several forms of benediction, together with about thirty pages of responsive readings in Welsh and in English.\nNo labor has been spared to make it a most valuable contribution to our Churches in their present condition. We offer it with great confidence that it will meet with the approval of all unprejudiced minds, and that it will add to the dignity and efficiency of our praise. Our Churches and others who are in need of a good substantial and inexpensive Hymnal are invited to correspond and send their orders to the Secretary of the Committee.\nYours in the Master's service,\nREV.

Much news and mighty interesting. Hoped to be able by stirring around a bit to get some news on the weighty problem of the right job for the right man, at the right time. School, teaching, business, travel, higher degree, and ripe and ready for a better teaching job. What a combination, but everyone in the teaching field out here is hanging on to their job with all the teeth they have left. And schools are not expanding. And so.....I regret to report that at present.....but I will not forget.\nAs to other things we have a little Kiowa of our own out here and meet once a month. George Wells and wife, two daughters, two sons, two sons-inlaw, two daughters-in-law, and by the last count nine grandchildren, or is it ten or eleven. Marston Wells died two years ago, and Mrs McMahan four years ago when on a visit to us.\nMrs Marston Wells is still with us, and wrote marvelous poetical minutes for the Kiowa club until two years ago. And now Ida Nay shines as poetical recorder of the deeds and doings of the said club. Her father is still alive, and still a great checker player. Her sister Nellie Nay Morrill lives in Pasadena and has a mighty nice married daughter.\nHarry Matthews died but his wife May and a couple of sons and daughters and theirs add to the list.\nStella Hockenberry Wilson (Mrs Tommy) has a marvelous daughter Gladys (Mrs Robert Burgess) and they have a college girl (Mary Bob) and three sons. Abner Wilson died a year ago, but his wife and two sons and two daughters are still with us, all married. Uncle Jack Crewdson, after a long illness died just the other day.\nThe Strothers family adds about eight to our gatherings, and Mrs Milton Wells (Willa Patton) and married daughter Jean. Milt lives up in the mountains. They got a divorce.\nWho else? Gertrude Cattell and her two boys went back to Denver last year but could not escape as a big bad bold California man went after her and married her. Hope he'll bring her back.\nChas Skilling (or was he after your date, anyway he was Ada's brother) is an old bach living in Walnut Park, a suburb.\nMrs Laughman comes out every year.\nJust had a wire from Mary McMahan that Dorsey Singleton died day before yesterday. (Wednesday) He had been in poor health and his mind was affected. A blessing that he found release.\nDora is still going strong and having a good time with her church work and Faculty Wives Club (Treasurer, or Secretary from time to time) and the Town and Gown Club, and bossing her son John age 26, weight 201, and me,...age not mentioned, weight now down to 165, bath room weight, after having had a street weight for some years of 200."]},{"pageid":35020,"pagefilename":"6cd61a6c7b480134ddae1e0749b84c0d.jpg","transcription":["John took his bachelors degree here four years ago, went to New York for Macy's Executive Training course (two years), came back and took his masters degree in Economics, and has been doing various things this year along research lines. Hope to send him to Germany for a year for his Ph.D., when finances and Germany improve.\nOh yes. Addie Rumsey George, husband and daughter Margaret live in Escondido. We get a whale of a chicken dinner by going down there once a year. Margaret graduates this year from San Diego State Normal and is headed for library work.\nClate Herr lives in Palo Alto, and his two married daughters near by. Ada, who is still with Southwestern at Winfiled was out here on a sabbatical last year, guess it was two years.\nOf my old high school class, Stella Hockenberry lives at Long Beach, Addie Rumsey in Escondido, Clate Herr in Palo Alto, and since being here I have met Emma Jones, visiting from Kingman Kansas, and Mary McSherry Gaskill visiting from Alva Oklahoma. Only Linc Herr now associate justice of Okla Supreme Court, and Albert Rumsey still at Kiowa have insisted remaining permanently around the old stamping ground.\nBe good to yourselves. If I get time when I pass through Chicago I'd like to call on Zaidee if you would send me her address or have her come down town for lunch. I have most flattering memories of her as well as of you and Mrs Everett. I often think of you not only as the man who gave me my final high school exam in Greek, and as teacher who stepped in the high school breach and filled it like Horatio at the Bridge, but as the first broad minded, sane, tolerant, preacher with whom I ever came in contact.\nMy best, our best, to you and yours,\nWD Moriarty"]},{"pageid":35021,"pagefilename":"00bf87d5f52c6773e8fb4b521a7d2f89.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35022,"pagefilename":"44fc62290ddd24c1050b859261defe51.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35023,"pagefilename":"f31d01cd9b2999daca68f361279daa85.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35024,"pagefilename":"650f4cb858c1294e61fc8b70ece6e058.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35025,"pagefilename":"b844c785e12394c9c9e8e26ecd1f3813.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35026,"pagefilename":"890acf9d34acc769052e6f06ffc70ed9.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35027,"pagefilename":"f35aa5abc3942d3d4a93f14c9520654d.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35028,"pagefilename":"7a259d7944eddf7dadc46a5c82053816.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35029,"pagefilename":"9a45644260d5d89f925eb45077b599bd.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35030,"pagefilename":"92a004e253a5267b8e41dabc8b93a334.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35031,"pagefilename":"8481a04d0f3cae12f673702702dde875.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35032,"pagefilename":"0bf71b5ab726522ece10b742bc311835.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35033,"pagefilename":"924dfed472aeaff5d75d3ddee46b9e26.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35034,"pagefilename":"72cc272748bd2d912b384aba7bc26fa9.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35035,"pagefilename":"871fc1bb4a3370e1d4b5f1d1c687b898.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35036,"pagefilename":"51daa8ff6a261488f5c7723cc3f384e7.jpg","transcription":[]},{"pageid":35037,"pagefilename":"c6c93db51069f46f902bd5a0684d393e.jpg","transcription":["Dear Morris.

Roberts is lots better. Mamma is going to get Margaret in short clothes now and then we can put her in the Baby-tender. I got a pen-knife, a trinket box, a pair of slippers, a silk handkerchief, three neckties, a dollar and the thimble that you sent me for Xmas. I like the thimble very much and I thank you for it. I could'nt use a thimble before Christmas but now I can't get along without it. There is a man lecturing his name is John. P.D. John. I guess I will close for this time So\nGoodbye\nYour loving niece\nZaidee Everett"]},{"pageid":35178,"pagefilename":"2367ceedbda114f54c894a3a5741580d.jpg","transcription":["Kiowa Kansas\nJan 29 1899.\nDear Aunties:\nRoberts and Sister started to write to you and wanted me to write to you too. We study Book-Keeping now and have written in our Day-Book, Journal & Ledger. I like it pretty well. We quit Physical Geography before Christmas. I bought me a second-hand saddle and like it very much. We have a nice riding-horse and I like to ride better than anything else. For Christmas I got a shirt, hat, lantern a pin that you sent me and a nice tie to wear it in. Papa got a hat, a moustache cup & saucer, and a comb from me. Mamma got a double-boiler & a box of nice hair-pins. Roberts got a whole lot of things a doll, a pair of slippers, a silver napkin-ring, a silver spoon from you, and a lot of other things. When he was sick he got two dollars for taking a tea spoonful of medicine and Mamma gave him a calf but he said that he would rather have the calf be part of Mamma's, and the doctor said he would have his pony brought from his claim in the strip for Roberts to ride. Hoping you will write very soon\nI remain yours\nWith Love\nHoward."]}],"title":"John Edward Everett letters, 1880-1929"}}}

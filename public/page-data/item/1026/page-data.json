Col. Pickering in reply agreed that it would be consistant with his Judgment, that offers of Peace should be made before they struck or carried on the war.\nAfter the Conference we deliver'd a letter of Recommendation to the Col,; who politely offer'd to do us any Service in his Power, and conducted us to a certain Doctor Pakr, a place of perhaps the best Accommodation in the Town. The Town contains 10 or 12 log Houses & Huts scattered in the space of half or three quarters of a Mile, in an old Indian Cornfield, a flat Piece of Ground on the River, but among Trees chiefly Pines.\nWe went to see our Horses which we had sent over the River to Pasture, my Horse's back being hurt by our rough and long Travel through the roughest Country & difficultest Roads I ever past, we frequently had to ride along shore to miss the Mountain, where there was scarce room for our Horse's feet, and in other Places more roomy the Horses lay as if shot out of"},{"pageid":68353,"pagefilename":"e691666f3533bc79a6302b1b920ac128.jpg","transcription":"of a Cart, which obliged us frequently to walk, it was with difficulty in manty Places that we or our Horses could keep our feet; nevertheless we persevered in pretty good spirits Col. Forrist was an old Soldier, and travelled the road before, but what I most admired was to see my young friend and Companion encounter the greatest Difficulty with so much cheerfulness; our living both as to food & lodging being similar to the Description of the Country; at times I was not altogether free from fears & doubting, it seemed like a confirmation to me to have such an agreeable Companion. In the afternoon we went to Col. Pickering's Quarters where he introduced to me a young man by the Name of Parrish, who had just returned from the Indian Nations, having been employ'd as a Messenger to give information of the Treaty, & invite the Indians in, this young man appeared to have something clearer about him, and I was the more taken with him for his Namesake, which I have rarely met with, he went with me to the Indians Cabbins and interpretted for me where I had an opportunity of informing them who we were, and where we came from, & our Business which, was purely to attend the Treaty, & pay them assist in love & good will, and take them by the hand as friends & decendents of the first Propriator of Pennsylvania, W.

And likewise related a Tradition handed down by the Antients; that there was a time when the Indians lived together in Harmony in one Town or a Place, but they offended the good Spirit, who sent a famine among them, which obliged them to disperse and become a separate People, by which means their Language was confounded; so that the different Tribes could not understand each other."},{"pageid":68355,"pagefilename":"2eae65d6c75d1dc0a5ff97434694cf66.jpg","transcription":"But it appears that one Brant who found a hunting Party of about 30 of the aforesaid peacable Indians out after Game, who told them their Tribe had joined the 6 Nations in War, which induced them to take up the Hatchet thro' Deception, when their Chief was informed thereof, he disowned them as his People, as disregarding his Discipline, and kept them at a Distance a considerable Time, such was the Care of the Chippeway to support ___ (?) & good Order---In the Evening we went home with Daniel Ross about 7 Miles North, he is a friendly Man & professes to be convinced of friends Principles, & I hope in a good measure is; he is called or known among the People by the Name of friend Ross, he treated us with kindness and told us he had taken up about 60 thousand Acres of Land and is settling families on it as fast as he can; but expresses a belief that their is something like a Scourge hanging over the Land, & a fear possesses his Mind that unless the great Preserver of Men preventl what is call'd the Heathon will again bring Terror upon the inhabitants.\nOur Horses were missing, our friend Ross furnished us with others, & told us if we did not find our own we should be welcome to them, but ours were found next day.\nWe walked about 5 Miles & din'd at Saml Seleys (?), we went thro a fine fertile part; the timber large in the low lands mostly white pine & very tall, the clear land produces wheat from 20 to 30 bushels per Acre.

The entertainment is of a religious and thoroughly refined nature. The profits range from $10.00 to $100.00 or more.\nIn brief, this plan consists of an Exhibition of THE MASTERS' SERIES OF BIBLE PHOTOGRAVURES, making a splendid art exhibit, combined with a pleasant program, for which tickets will be sold by Sunday-School scholars at ten cents each, entitling the purchaser to admission to the Exhibition and also to possession of the one of the Photogravures.\nFrank L. Brown, Chairman of the Intermediate Department of the International Sunday-School Union, and Superintendent of the largest Sunday-School in the world, says of these photogravures: \"These pictures are gems of artistic work. They represent a distinct advance in Bible illustration, and should find wide use among Sunday-school workers. I have never seen any so choice.\"\nMarion Lawrence, General Secretary of the International Sunday-School Association writes: \"I have never seen their equal. Certainly you have hit upon a fine idea and I hope they will do much good and be much used. I shall be glad to recommend the pictures whenever I have opportunity to do so.\nTHE TRINITY ART EXHIBITION embodies an entertainment peculiarly appropriate for Churches and Church Organizations. It is held solely to promote the distribution of the Photogravures. Kindly mail us the enclosed post card at once and we will then write you describing the plan in much greater detail.\nYour prompt reply is necessary to secure this exhibition for your Church.\nSincerely yours,\nCURRENT LITERATURE PUBLISHING COMPANY.\nJames?

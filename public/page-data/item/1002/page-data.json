Such were General Sheridan's intentions when Gen'l. Hazel left him at Harker the 1st of October.     Gen'l. H. says that his post would have been re-established but for your report, on account of that, however, Gen'l.

At his request the Arbuckle saw mill has been packed up and held in readiness to come here, he expects to start it as soon as he reaches that post, have it put up in some \"fine maple walnut and cedar lumber\" described by the Shirleys as on the head of Sugar Creek, ten miles East, beyond the burnt Shanklin Agency -and go to work building here for the winter at least.\n   You well know what that will lead to.  It is jut the way the post happened to be built here before, the troops camped here in the Fall, and gradually, thro' the winter so much work was done that it was concluded best not to move in the spring - altho' it has never been intended to locate permanently here.  In this way posts have often been disadvantageously located.  It will be a pity to have this occur again, especially after so much pains was taken by you to intelligently ascertain and report upon the best locality for a new post.\n    General Hazen does not think General Sheridan has changed his mind, but seems to construe Gen'l.

The Reservation of these people, are per Medicine Lodge Treaty referred to by Gen'l. Sherman, is not here, but as follows,  its boundaries are, North.

Sherman, by his letter, plainly intends that these Indians should ultimately go onto the proper reservation.    Doubtless if he knew that they were now here, ready to go into their own country at once as is the fact, he would not object to their doing so.    And, as it is intended that the new post in this region shall be the location of the Agency and depot for these Indians, it is certainly better, that, if it can be, it be located at first at some central point in their Reservation rather than here, North of the Washita, not on their reservation at all.

He had met and talked with Little Raven's [2 words underline] band of Araphoes, had started then Eastward again, seen them well into the Mountains and was about pushing on No. West to the Cheyennes and the rest of the Arapahoes, whose village's he was expecting to reach yesterday [underline].  He sent his courier in on his own trail via Chandler's old ranche [3 words underline] and had three wagons sent out to him, or to meet him on his return, by that route [3 words underline], which he seems to consider quite direct.

Jacob wanted to camp there but Mr. Colyer protested and I told them I could not afford to more so slowly and must go on if they stopped there.    It was then agreed to go on five miles to the branch of Cache Ck. half way between the old ranche and  the place where our old June trail intercepts the Cobb road.  Jones and I call the stream Apache Creek.   We went on and camped there, the Infantry not coming up I sent a man back and found that Mr. Colyer had lost two tires from the wheels of his [underline] wagon, disabling the party and necessitating a day's delay to get another wagon from here.   I consequently sent word that I could not wait, and breaking camp I went on that night to the spot on head of Cache CK. where we came out of the hills the 30th of last June.    There I spent Tuesday night.

The chiefs of the portion remaining came to camp when sent for and claimed that the seceeders had only gone to Elk Creek on a buffalo hunt and would join the column of Arapahoes and Cheyennes en route for Camp Supply, on the Washita River.   During the day, however, I caused the trail to be carefully examined by reliable Comanches and from the various circumstances attending the movement satisfied myself that the party had started upon the representations of two men who had come to their camp from the plains the night before, had moved rapidly and with no intention of returning in this direction.   Their status became then that of prisoners of war violating their parole which bound them to remain quietly here until the 20th instant then move with the Arapahoes to their reservation via Camp Supply, and there await the action of the Department or superior commander, in determining the terms of the acceptance of their surrender.              In the absence of yourself and General Hazen no immediate action was taken beyond the preparation of a detachment of troops to pursue the delinquents, but as Gen'l. Hazen upon his return at sunset fully approved the movement, Major Kidd started soon after dark with one hundred and fifty men of"]},{"pageid":65593,"pagefilename":"a542272f0301de861778a7b5210701f9.jpg","transcription":["the Tenth Cavalry to endeavor to overtake the runaways and compel them to return, if possible without bringing on an engagement.  To prevent a general knowledge of the movement of troops that night Major Kidd avoided passing through the Indian camp by taking a rather circuitous route and did not get onto the trail of the Cheyennes until late on Tuesday, when every indication led to the belief that they had relieved themselves of the burden of lodge poles and similar baggage while traversing the mountains and broken up into small squads, their general course continuing Westward.   In that direction Major Kidd marched until Wednesday noon.  \n\n    I met the chiefs of the Arapahoes here on Tuesday, together with \"Little Robe\" and \"Bald Eagle\" of the Cheyennes, informed them of the movement of the column of troops, fully explained the object of it and received the assurance from all of them that no more of either tribe would leave no matter what might result, but that all remaining here were desirous of fulfilling their promise to move at once to their reservation.     Tuesday was the day which had been set for their departure but the scarcity of officers here had obliged Major Kidd to take with him Lt. Lee who had been designated to accompany the Indians to Camp Supply and consequently their final departure was postponed till Thursday, altho' they that day (Tuesday) moved out a short distance in the right direction.\n    At noon on Wednesday, 21st, Major Kidd halted with his command on Elk Creek, at the West end of the mountains, and sent out small reconnoitering parties while he grazed his animals.   One of these parties moving West about five miles came suddenly upon a herd of ponies and mules, just West of North Fork of Red River near the mouth of Elk Creek and approaching the Indians in charge, the latter fired upon the soldiers."]},{"pageid":65594,"pagefilename":"552dcb1bd1a1ff01151d469199fabee5.jpg","transcription":["Receiving this report Major Kidd saddled and moved forward as rapidly as possible, found the herd gone but soon came in sight of an Indian village packed up and on the move.   The Indians has a start of eight or ten miles and abandoned everything there [strike] encumbering them in their flight.   Upon reaching the camp ground his guides and interpreter pronounced the Indians to be unquestionably Arapahoes and Major Kidd decided not to follow and attack because of the probability of the band being that of \"Spotted Wolf\" of the Arapahoes, who, when he started, were reported to be on Elk CK. en route to join \"Little Raven\" here.   He endeavored to communicate to the Indians his intention of being friendly and not disturbing their property but the condition of his horses rendered it impossible to overtake the fugitives.    Major Kidd gathered up quite a quantity of abandoned property including several complete lodges and a number of ponies and mules, which he brought in with thim [strike t}.   His command arrived here last (Friday) night and the captured animals etc. are identified by a few Arapahoe and Cheyenne Indians still here, as the property of \"San Hill\" a well know Cheyenne Chief who has not been in this winter and whose followers the two men are now said to have been who came in last Sunday night and caused the sudden departure of Red Moon's party on Monday.    It was, therefore, a Cheyenne band that fled at major Kidd's approach, and in all probability Red Moon's deserters were with it.\n\n    On Thursday the 22nd, the chiefs of the Arapahoes and Cheyennes here called in a body to bid farewell to General Hazen and your Headquarters, and the movement of their people to Camp Supply may be considered as fairly commenced that day.

Hazen's rations, was made to them on starting to include the 29th instant.  One hundred beef cattle are driven with them and the seven (7) wagons belonging at Camp Supply go also, having on board 2000 pounds of Corn Mean and 100 pounds of Coffee for issue en route.  Altho' they were faithfully promised other thins these were the only Subsistence Stores that could be spared, the command here being at present entirely out of flour, sugar, rice, etc.\n   Lieutenant Lee, Tenth Cavalry, starts today and will join the Indian column before it reaches the Washita and thence proceed with it.\n   It is now reported that \"Spotted Wolf\" with the rest of the Arapahoes (about 50 lodges) will join \"Little Raven\" at old Fort Cobb.\n   Although it is certain that until very lately the Arapahoes have never fully understood the boundaries of the reservation prescribed for them in the Medicine Lodge Creek Treaty, and state without hesitation that the country is not satisfactory to them, I believe they accept the situation in good faith and will do exactly as they promise to move by a reasonably direct route to Camp Supply and if well received and provided for there, go to their reservation when ordered with the intention of remaining upon it.    On the other hand the Cheyennes are certainly not inclined at heart to go to their reservation and although I suppose \"Little Robe\" and \"Bald Eagle\" to be as desirous to do right as any men of their tribe, I fear that not withstanding all their good promises, the small band which starts with the Arapahoes will not go to Camp Supply."]},{"pageid":65596,"pagefilename":"ecc80aa87524f0cb9d84c9bdaa9cb7c3.jpg","transcription":["At the final interview on Thursday they made a strong appeal to remain here with the Comanches, and when representing you, I replied to them that they could not do so must comply with the promise to go to Camp Supply which they made upon their arrival, displeasure and dissatisfaction were plainly exhibited.\n\n    General Hazen started North yesterday morning.  Just before his departure he official notified you that the funds at his disposal applicable to the subsistence of Indians had been exhausted and called upon the Subsistence Department of the Army, through you, to feed the Indians upon this reservation until other arrangements are made.   It is understood here now that Congress at its' recent session made no appropriation for this purpose for the remainder of the present fiscal year, but that under the Indian Appropriation Bill for the year ending June 30th, 1870, as enacted, a system similar [underline] to General Hazen's will undoubtedly be put in operation soon aft the first of July next.     It is evident, however, that the provision must at once be made for the Subsistence Department to supply the Comanches, Kiowas and Apaches at this place, at least until July, and in like manner the feeding of the Arapahoes and Cheyennes will devolve upon the military authorities at Camp Supply or the new post to be established upon the upper reservation, unless the War Department is prepared to let these Indians run loose again and inaugurate another war on the plains.\n    As usual, therefore, the burden of this perplexing Indian business once more falls upon the Army, swelling the expenses of the War Department, while there is no corresponding credit received.\n                   Very respectfully,"]},{"pageid":65597,"pagefilename":"d29e902be8506cb59f3171f5340ab8a8.jpg","transcription":["Your obedient servant\nHenry E.

There seems to be some reason in it doesn't there? I found that just that defect was in our chimney and put a brick in the vacant spot. I cannot tell yet whether the remedy will prove adequate.

Was glad to get your note of Sat. eve. and Sunday, Father - altho there were lots of things omitted that were in your power to disclose! How did you find the Baby this time Mother? Has anything of moment or of momentary interest transpired since I saw her Wednesday? I have not written her, thinking that I would hear from her. I will try to write her today or tomorrow.\nI have found it difficult to do much since coming up.

It contains the trilogy Agamemnon, Choenphori, Eumenides. I am not form-plushing? when I say I liked Agamemnon. I took out a book Saturday, the fourth volume of Santayana's the Life of Reason: Reason in Art. It was the only one available at the time. Surprising to me, I find him readable and partially understandable. I have read over 50 pages, which leaves 175 yet to read. The chapters I have walked thru so far are The Basis of Art in Instinct and Experience; Rationality of Industrial Art; Emergence of Fine Art; and I am now in Music.\nI came down here this morning with the avowed intention to write - a short story, poem, anything. I may surprise myself and do it. I have lacked sufficient resolution to send Premonition, returned from Harpers, out again. For a principle, how would it be to always have something out?\nIt is to laugh at myself!

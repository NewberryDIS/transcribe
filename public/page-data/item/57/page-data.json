Soon I heard a rustling at my door and a little maiden entered. She was exceedingly beautiful and her smile riveted my attention. There was meaning in that smile, so cheerful yet so full of purity?, I felt, though she was but a child, that I was in the presense of a [superior] being. Perceiving my enquiring look, she said, \"my name is Sympathy, I have come to dispel your gloom and show you that Benevolence is not without her votaries?, follow me.\" I obeyed, impelled by a power which I could not resist. Swiftly we passed over many hills and vales, through shady groves and across many? lakes, how, I could not tell, for we seemed not to walk, and now we approached a broad, quiet river. Its waters clear as crystal plainly revealed the pure? surface of its pebbled bed. On its banks blossomed flowers of the richest hue and variegated unclear, each seeming to vie with the others in emitting the sweetest fragrance. My little guide directed me to enter this stream, for there was"},{"pageid":17789,"pagefilename":"7c6cfb56628cc6d7ada36f59380adc6f.jpg","transcription":"no other way to reach the country we sought. Scarcely had I touched the limpid waters before whole soul was filled with heavenly extacy. I felt an affection for every body, even my enemies were transformed into friends and I forgot all bitter thoughts. Amazed I asked the unclear of this. \"This,\" replied Sympathy, is the river of forgiveness, its  waters flow around our country that all who enter may pass through and be washed from all unkindness. That land which we are now approaching is the island of Love and Benevolence is our queen. Delighted I quickened my pace and soon we stepped on the opposite shore. Beautiful beyond description was this isle. Nature seemed to have chosen this favorite retreat and made it her Eden. No lovely lanscape had I ever seen but a sweet model existed here. Mute with wonder I scarcely moved, and my gentle guide entering into all my rapture gazed upon my face with unclear eyes. Her soul lived not in solitude, but delighted to mingle with others. Were any happy, she rejoiced more than though hers was the good obtained; did any mourn, she loved to weep with them. There were many people gathered in the embrace? unclear groves that studded the isle. All happy in their various ways, seemed particularly to rejoice when they did their neighbor a favor. I was amazed to find no beggars, none destitute of life's comforts and necessaries, neither were there any who reveled in their abundance. I turned to Sympathy to learn the reason of this and she bid me enter the next grove. It was larger than those surrounding and seemed even more verdant. The trees were filled with merry songsters and the green carpet was thickly set with flowers. In the center of this wood was a unclear throne decked by Nature's lavish hand. A maiden of rare beauty sat upon it. In her eye shone love every one, and her smile would"},{"pageid":17790,"pagefilename":"b0026210d8ddc99e4d061f9f2e224145.jpg","transcription":"have adorned as angel face.

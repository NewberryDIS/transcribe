Kearney.\n              To go into the history of all the rascalities practised in this country by the employees of the Quartermaster's department would require more time and space than I can devote now to the subject, and I shall only mention, the most glaring irregularities, and those that I think can be remedied in a great degree by the proper attention on the part of the different Quartermasters and the Commanding offices of Posts, and I do not presume to dictate what course should be pursued by other commanding officers than myself.\n                The class of men employed now by the Quartermasters Department is certainly, the worst I ever came in contact with, and the amount of pillaging and open robbery committed by them"]},{"pageid":69388,"pagefilename":"8339b03eff653a59096de8300aa00f08.jpg","transcription":["is almost incredible.

Another wagon master stated that two mules were shot by Indians, and died, that a steer was also shot by Indians, when it has been discovered that the mules have disappeared, doubtless stolen, and that the Steer was butchered and eaten by the Quartermaster's men.

I found many of them here in the employ of General Dandy when I arrived here, and they were retained by Colonel Camp, and then turned over to the present Post Quartermaster major Grines, who will I feel satisfied to all in his power to rid the service of these bad characters.  He has diminished the number of his employees somewhat, but I think the list might be made much smaller still.\n    It is impossible to punish these characters here, although there is a United States Commissioner here, there is no deputy Marshal to take charge of prisoners and carry them to the Territorial Capital at Yankton, and all he (The Commissioner) can do is to request me to keep them in confinement.

The man who ran away with the sixteen mules, a week or two since was employed by the Quartermaster here without recommendation from any one, and I think he had only been employed a few days when he ran away.  And if I should order the discharge of the whole batch of these creatures, I would be obliged to detail soldiers to do the labor, and there is now a citizen employee borne one the rolls of Quartermasters men at this Post for every Soldier for duty at the Post.  And here I beg to remark that I am never consulted in any way as to who shall be employed, or the number to be employed.  At this Post there are five [underline] clerks employed, besides a storekeeper with an assistant, and Master of transportation, eleven wagon masters, and various other employees in all amounting to nearly three hundred men     There are two little boys employed as messengers in the Quartermaster's Office at $45 per month and a ration, when either of the little fellows ought to be glad (and doubtless would be) to receive $10 per month.

Oregon is generally supposed to be a part of the Indian country named in the act of Congress of June 30, 1834 but Such is not the case.  Great Britian and the United States made a treaty in 1818, by which the Northern boundary of the former was extended west on the 49th parallel of North latitude to the Stony Mountains, and the Territory beyond these was described as country to be held in the joint occupation of the two powers.  The Rocky Mountains then was the Western Boundary of the United States for legislative purposes and so continued until 1840.  The act of 1834, shows in terms that it was intended for a country over which the general Government had absolute and exclusive jurisdiction, Congress by express enactments in 1850, extended said act to this Territory for the reason as must be supposed that it was not in force here before that time.  The act of 1834 then, has no vitality here because Oregon is Indian Country, but by virtue of the act of 1850, which gives it effect here so far as its provisions may be applicable, is that provision prohibiting the sale of liquor to the Indian applicable very much of the act of 1834, is [strike] is clearly unsuited to the present condition of the country, all those provisions which tend to prevent emigration, the free occupation"]},{"pageid":69424,"pagefilename":"fb0b4658cc5afb6e3701c6bda9c94509.jpg","transcription":["and use of the country by whites, must be considered repealed, whatever militates against the true interest of a white population is inapplicable.

That clause extended over us the general laws of the united States, under which we possessed the right to import and sell to all classes of customers goods of every description, spirits and wines included.  I arrive at the same conclusion with the Cheif Justice that up to June 5, 1850, there were no restrictions or regulations (touching the sale of Spirits or other commodities to Indians) on that day Congress enacted \"That the law regulating trade and intercourse with the Indians [strike s] tribes east of the Rocky Mountains, or such provisions of the same as may be applicable, be extended over the Indian tribes in the Territory of Oregon\" ---- the law refered to is the act of 1834.

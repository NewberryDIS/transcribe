Erasmus received a letter from You in which you seemed to think we had forgotten you and perhaps our neglecting so long to write to you has given you just grounds for so thinking. But Mother you are mistaken in so thinking for I regard you Dear Mother with the same feelings of love (only strengthen by years) as I did when I was wont to sit upon your knees and listen to the expressions of your maternal love as it flowed so kindly from your lips. and be it far from me to wish to cause one unhapy thought or one moment of anguish to my Mother. What motive Edwin could have in communicating to you such erroneous ideas as you say he did I know not, and I am authorized by Erasmus to give them an unqualified contradiction he made this proposition to Edwin to take you with your family - Edwin and himself and Setth down in the western country. He thought it would be a home for you in your old age. But Edwin declined and this Spring he got married and again renewed the the proposition not knowing that Father was at home But Edwin said it was altogather out of reason in taking you out with them. Since then Father has returned home and as you say a reformed man.

How it causes my heart to bound with joy in perusing the thoughts & recognizing the hand writing of my mother. I wrote to Edwin in answer to your letter & in respect to my brother Jesse. I requested him to answer me as soon as any thing definite was decided upon in reguard to him. I wrote also to Jesse, but I have heard nothing in reguard to him since.

It stands in our room.There is a fire made in sisters room every morning before she gets up. I imagine we should not sit as we do now long could we but see you coming into our room. We board at a tavern. Our school commenced last Monday. We have a large school & hence find enough to keep us busy. We expect Miss Lydia P.

There's quite a panic here upon the Subject. Men & beasts are dying off in New Orleans by hundreds, & people are leaving the City in great consternation. There have been but few cases in Louisville & most of these were people who had come up from New Orleans. We were in Louisville last week. One boat came up to L from N Orleans while we were there which buried 14 passengers on her way. There were several other boats that buried a number. It will not probably make its appearance here before warm weather comes on. It may have a serious effect upon our School another summer but I hope not. I think there is probably no more danger to be apprehended from it here than in New England. We have had a vast deal of rain this winter, much more than usual I am told. How is Lydia's health & how is she enjoying herself? I would like much to see her. I sometimes feel that she must be lonely. Give her our best love. How are David Jesse & little Myron? Don't forget to remember us to them & also to Erasmus & Sister Sarah and also give Eddy & Marshall a kiss for us & the little boy two. I sent a letter to Erasmus a few days ago enclosing 25 $ I will also enclose twenty five more in this & will Send another letter in a few days. Think I will write Edwin and send 25 by his letter.

I can hardly be reconciled to leaving you in the manner in which I am compelled to do. Brother has probably informed you of the circumstances of the case and all the reasons of my remaining here.

I have raised all the objections I can but to no purpose - all seems determined that I shall remain here. It is really a beautiful place and the Academy a very handsome, finished and convenient building and I presume I shall enjoy myself much, but I had determined to stay with you until I should return to my own dear New England home and it is hard to give it up.

It was a great drawback on my school that Sarah did not come when I wanted and I had to take Potter. He drove off some twenty Scholars and would have driven them all off I believe if I had not driven him off. But now it is coming up and going right. Jesse is doing tolerable well now. But he is a very careless Boy and if Sarah was here she could help me a great deal in getting him along and keeping him out of bad company for it is no little work I can assure, and many times he steals off when I don't it, when if she was here she could prevent it.

Ohio   May 16th 1852\nBro Nathan,\n\n    Your letter was received some days since but as I have had all the labor to do in the school I have not had time to answer it till now. Miss Woodbury has had the Measles--they have been in the school just as they were last year only a little more so. Miss W. did not speak a word for two weeks and we feared she never would get her voice, but would have the quick consumption She however is getting better and will go into School tomorrow. We have had high water here--it was between 7 & 8 feet deep in the Institute --over five feet on the floor of our house. Things here are pretty much as they were when you left only a little more so. The Trustees have done nothing. Brother Eaton has done a little, but has been confined to the House most of the time. I thought you was a Man of your word, till I got your last letter. You stated that you would not come here without a salary of $700. I had told the Trustees so and they would have given it. But it appears that you accepted the offer of the School without a Salary. I am sorry both for you and the School. for you, because your pocket will tell a sorry tale before a year is out, and for the School because I am afraid you will","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40794,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/40794","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/00364dd45057e5fb7cf7f7c7869a1e8d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/00364dd45057e5fb7cf7f7c7869a1e8d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/00364dd45057e5fb7cf7f7c7869a1e8d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/00364dd45057e5fb7cf7f7c7869a1e8d.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T17:14:15+00:00","modified":"2020-05-28T00:56:12+00:00","filename":"00364dd45057e5fb7cf7f7c7869a1e8d.jpg","authentication":"77f8048c32698fcfbad167205de9648e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_039_006_02_o2.jpg","size":1498659,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2854,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048621136027408},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024546"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024546"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024546"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"00364dd45057e5fb7cf7f7c7869a1e8d.jpg","FileDateTime":1509383340,"FileSize":1498659,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2854\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2854,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:24 14:51:41","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:24 02:45:46","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:24 02:45:46","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3294,"ExifImageLength":4155,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":175,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/175","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"have to bury it in a year or two--it has the consumption now.

When do you think of coming out? I think it would be greatly for your interest to be here before this term closes, and I wish you would come before that time. The Students have Selected you to deliver an Address to them on the day before the term closes. Our Exercises will commence on Wednesday the 21st of July-in the Evening we shall have our first Exercise on Thursday Evening the Address will be delivered and Friday Evening the Exercises will close. I should like to have You here to take Charge of the Exercises on Wednesday Eve as the Music of that Evening will be made by the Choir & Hitchcock is gone and I have to take his place and lead the Choir. And shall have to be in the Singers Seats  Most of the time.  Friday Evening the Marietta Band furnish us with Music. I think it will do you good here to deliver the address-- not have it long-- say about three fourths of an hour. And commit to Memory--if you can. Is Myron coming to live with me? If so I wish to know it-- if he comes and I am prosperous and have my health, I will put him upon a farm","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40798,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/40798","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/fac187aec0d9df64285ad3140d39e98f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/fac187aec0d9df64285ad3140d39e98f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/fac187aec0d9df64285ad3140d39e98f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fac187aec0d9df64285ad3140d39e98f.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T17:14:27+00:00","modified":"2020-05-28T21:23:05+00:00","filename":"fac187aec0d9df64285ad3140d39e98f.jpg","authentication":"1a0f3308dca87f8bd2d84155502668d2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_039_007_02_o2.jpg","size":1501283,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2785,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049912992885165},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024611"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024611"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024611"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"fac187aec0d9df64285ad3140d39e98f.jpg","FileDateTime":1509383340,"FileSize":1501283,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2785\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2785,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:24 14:51:53","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:24 02:46:11","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:24 02:46:11","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3220,"ExifImageLength":4162,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":175,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/175","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"after he is thoroughly educated if he desires and his health will permit of it.

I think Lydia had better come and with you & Sarah. She can finish whatever she desires with Sarah and probably you or I can find her a place for teaching after awhile. She could have quite a number of Small Scholars. Enough I think to more than pay her way. And you and Sarah would not want to be bothered with them, and if the School goes right probably in the course of a year you could give her a situation here.  Dr. Regnier told me tonight that you told him you could not be here till the last of August. My advice to you is come now soon-- and Sarah and Myron & Lydia can come together or Myron can come with you, and Sarah and Lydia can come together. My school in Galesburg commences on the 30th of Aug & I shall have to start from here as soon as possible after I get through-- as soon as the 10th of Aug & probably before-- so that if you do not come before the time that the Dr says you will not find us here. And I have some business here that I must leave with you to settle-- and if Sarah wishes to see us she must come the moment her school is done. She can get all ready and leave as soon as it is done and get here before we go-- probably -- and unless Myron gets here before we he cannot go with us.

I have not time to give you any advice as to your future course. I was in hopes that you would have wisdom sufficient  about you to come out here before I left that I might give you the result of my Experience, but as you have done differently I do not see but that you must grope your way in dark as I have done. In reference to a Music Teacher, all that I can tell you is that Miss Franks will not do. The People will not send their scholars to her. unclear- Mrs Cicel ? Creel? might give the Lessons-- but you then loose the tuition, & also would loose the Music Class from the School. I must confess that I don't admire your arrangement for Teachers. The Primary Department I would cut loose from The School --it now amts to nothing since Helen left it, it cost me more than $100 out of Pocket-- in fact it has done nothing since Josephine Stedman had it. She broke it up-- and I believe she will break up any School. However much you may think of her as a woman, don't be so foolish as to think that hence, she is a good Teacher. And again I hope she will Treat you differently from which she has me-- her bills for her School amounted to about $70 dolls. I took them and gave her sixty-six dolls for them-- twenty-five dolls of them I shall never get a cent of & for collecting most of the rest it has cost me 10 per cent. While she was teaching she was in School and for this I charged her only half price. When she left here I gave her $20, I know I overpaid her, but could not stop to go down to the house and get the Books, and see-- it has run along till now and she has not been","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40803,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/40803","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8a7950077441a95e7ef62677577fe3d1.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8a7950077441a95e7ef62677577fe3d1.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8a7950077441a95e7ef62677577fe3d1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8a7950077441a95e7ef62677577fe3d1.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T17:14:43+00:00","modified":"2020-05-28T22:18:22+00:00","filename":"8a7950077441a95e7ef62677577fe3d1.jpg","authentication":"60832760560cbd0c63f317f26b5b903e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_039_009_02_o2.jpg","size":1659509,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2849,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053934096434096},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024641"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024641"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024641"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8a7950077441a95e7ef62677577fe3d1.jpg","FileDateTime":1509383340,"FileSize":1659509,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2849\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2849,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:24 14:52:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:24 02:46:41","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:24 02:46:41","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":2,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3273,"ExifImageLength":4135,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":175,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/175","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"here since when I made my bills out. I made out hers and there was $10 or between 9 and 10 due me from her -- and if she took her old bills as she ought and pay me what I paid her for them she would owe me more than fifty dolls. I cant present one to a person who will not say they won't pay it, for she did not learn them anything- -and they are a class of People whom it will no good to sue, for you can't make anything off them --some of them I have compromised with and taken what they would pay -- shall try and do so with all. But after doing by her as I did, I made out her bill as I would any body elses and sent it to her and she says she won't pay. I have overcharged her and have got more than my pay now. I never believed there was a woman on Earth who would be small enough to use me as she has, and that too for less than ten dolls-- it takes but a few cents to buy some folks and I find more and more of them every day. Now I don't care how deep you are in with her, I just ask you to keep your eyes open-- and for your school's sake don't have her one of your Teachers if you wish to get along. Again, I am told Sarah is only going to stay one year-- if so, it is the worst arrangement you could possibly make, to have her come at all-- for when she leaves your Female Department will be down for a year-- if you had consulted me about Teachers, I know you would have been better off--if you had got a good man or woman besides Sarah, and better a woman, who could teach Music and the other Branches and thus assist you, you would make $500 by the bargain whereas now if you don't loose that amount I am mistaken. But do the best you can. I shall talk with Bro Bartlett the minister here, and he can tell you-- it is too long to write. I intended to send Sarah fifty dolls but I have such work settling and so many disputing bills and deductions to make that I shan't have enough to get us out of Town  even after settling the Piano. Do you make it an invariable rule that every person rich or poor, big or little, male or female who enters the school shall pay you for the time they enter before you received them as students-- let them squirm as much as they please-- do it-- it will be hundreds of Dolls in your pocket. I will put advertisements into the Papers. I shall leave here the Sixth or 9th inst.-- and will pay Sarah as soon now as possible. We had a grand Exercise-- better than ever before. There has been no sickness in town till within a week or two-- there is some flux now and a little Cholera-- most of it, if not all, occasioned by imprudence in eating-- two cases yesterday died in a few hours. I think your prospects tolerable fair. Shall leave my things for you to ship when the water rises in the fall-- and whatever business I have for you to do I will leave with J. Holden Jr.  We are all well save Abby and I am afraid that she has a cough that will carry her off before a great while unless we can do something for it. We have done everything that we can think but have not affected it. Perhaps a change of climate will help her. Sarah has stood like iron. She never even had the summer complaint last summer nor has not this so far. She is a bright little girl. My Bowels have been strong and well so far and hope they will so continue.  Miss Woodbury is well. Keep your eye peeled when you come here-- for you will find any quantity of wolves dressed up in sheep's clothing and if opportunity offers they will throw off the fleece and show the hair and teeth-- look out for them-- Direct your next to Galesburg  Knox Co.  Ill.  If nothing happens we shall be there before the 20th inst.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                         Your Brother P.R.

We were ywo days doing from Marietta to Cincinnati.. Laid in Cin. 3 days for a boat to start for St. Louis.  Were 8 days going from Cin. to St. Louis and 4 days and nights going from St. Louis to this place Making a long and tedious journey - but we were all of us in good health all the way - save my bowels - they gave way at Cin. and troubled me all the rest of the way - do now - but I am of the opinion that it is a very bad cold that I took the last of July working off that way.

He may consider me a fool, Yet I think I am capable of taking care of myself as long as God blesses","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40822,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/40822","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5a91eef1888f7db413741a94939900b3.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5a91eef1888f7db413741a94939900b3.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5a91eef1888f7db413741a94939900b3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5a91eef1888f7db413741a94939900b3.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T17:15:35+00:00","modified":"2020-05-31T01:34:46+00:00","filename":"5a91eef1888f7db413741a94939900b3.jpg","authentication":"3c3f60293a1a62a3b187adf356b4b81f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_040_002_05_o2.jpg","size":1364792,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2357,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053614607394836},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["234813"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["234813"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["234813"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5a91eef1888f7db413741a94939900b3.jpg","FileDateTime":1509383341,"FileSize":1364792,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2357\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2357,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:26 15:12:00","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:24 23:48:13","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:24 23:48:13","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":13,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2261,"ExifImageLength":3453,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":175,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/175","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"me with little amount of reason and good sense and health with which he endowed me by birth - Now You Understand the matter.

I have had occasion to do so but once and it was not long before the same scholars wished to go back into the Class & let them do so and since then they carry their end well. Hornbrook certainly when I left him was three terms study ahead many students, that I have here in the Eng. Branches and had just begun the Languages. They now are one term ahead of him in the Eng Branch and at the rate he had gone in the languages he cannot be where they are in the Languages in a year and one half.

Perhaps you will say that I have brave Scholars & that yours are not as smart! My students are no better than thousands of others. Yet I learned them from the start to get lessons out and get them well & long lessons and now they get them as easily as they would by the other Course of Teaching, a half dozen lines. I have no faith in that mode of teaching that requires two or three years to fit a student for College. I know nothing of Your Mode of teaching the Languages. I only realize from what Hornbrook tells me of his progress, & he thinks, he is doing well so that I am satisfied. Yet I know that if he has been in the class with some students that had studied Latin there, when I was there, that it is an easy matter to account for his progress. I conclude from what he said that he had read the Reader & Vici Romae or most of it & was nearly ready to take Caesar.

I should have staid here and settled my affairs had it not been for them.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40850,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/40850","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/eefeec618602d745349b5ee22a1d1904.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/eefeec618602d745349b5ee22a1d1904.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/eefeec618602d745349b5ee22a1d1904.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/eefeec618602d745349b5ee22a1d1904.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T17:16:55+00:00","modified":"2020-06-02T22:56:20+00:00","filename":"eefeec618602d745349b5ee22a1d1904.jpg","authentication":"78ee38caa1c5d70a4156db268ccbd8d0","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_040_011_05_o2.jpg","size":1187614,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2287,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048082317122544},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["235130"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["235130"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["235130"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"eefeec618602d745349b5ee22a1d1904.jpg","FileDateTime":1509383342,"FileSize":1187614,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2287\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2287,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"13mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:26 15:13:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:24 23:51:30","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:24 23:51:30","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2131,"ExifImageLength":3353,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":175,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/175","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Myron was here and wanted to go to Laporte and went Expecting that he would go there, and pay up what he owed & come on, but the result you know as well as I do - Had I sold the teams at Ft.

You must overlook my neglecting to write to you as there was some things which I wanted to know before I did. We recieved papers from you last week. We are all quite well except the baby & hope this will find you the same. We live in the same place that we did last year only have moved up stairs. Mr. Smith lives down below. Uncle Cheney has moved down to the Pike place. Uncle John Nickerson has bought the large place which Grandfather used to own & has moved down this spring, & Grandpa has gone to live with them. He talks of going to the Cape before long, to stay a while. I went up there yesterday with Cousin Jesse J Kendall from the Cape. He has been up about six weeks & is going back in about a fortnight. Edwin is at work for Mr. Pliny P. Gould. David continues to  live with Mr. Smith. Jesse is going to live at Uncle Cutting's this summer. Father has been at work for Mr. Lewis Brigham this winter has taken a job in Petersham for the summer  He does pretty much the same. I believe father's case come on in June after you went away. It was decided in his favor. Mr. Powers carried it to the Supreme Court & it came on last week. Father got the case again. Mr. Powers is to pay the cost on both sides (which is not small) & to pay for the sixty seven dollars besides. I expect it is settled unless Mr. Powers carries it on farther. I have been expecting to teach school this summer but have not any engaged yet don't know now whether I shall or not. Mother has been to Wendall this spring. Edwin has been to Vermont. Louisa Smith has been down also this spring went back yesterday. Mr. James Doane has bought Grandpa Small place. We have heard from Paul several times this winter. He has been teaching school.

Numbers have expressed a hope in Christ among whom are Sarah & Roena Chaney. A week ago last Sabbath witnessed a very solemn & affecting scene 27 for the first time confessed Christ before men and united with the church. Eight of them were baptized and Nathan Henry Bronsdon has gone, to be with us not more. He died about  two months ago very happy indeed. He was deranged a great part of the time but when he had his 'right' mind his theme was all religion & he was very anxious for all impenitent sinners. I do hope Nathan that I have made my peace with God. You don't know how glad I felt when I read in your letter that you had resolved with the help of God to have a different life. How many times I have wished I could see you & have a long talk  with you but I suppose I must be deprived of the privelege for the present. Our family troubles are much the same but in all of them how comforting it is to look forward to that world where trouble never comes. O may we meet there. I hope father's mind will be different.

Lydia & I have been meeting to day but we are now seated at home very comfortable if I may call it so . But it don't seem much like home to me for when I look about me it seems as if I had no home.  We are very well of it for provisions for us. Yesterday Edwin brought us a barrel of flour which we are to braid for. Last week we had considerable hard wood brought to us from Uncle Francis expect some more I suppose Edwin will be responsible for it.  We have meat necessaries & clothing to make us comfortable we have a stove also but have not got our best furniture nor bedding but we have enough to get along very well with.  I do not feel worried at all but that we shall get along.  We have been to school at No 5 about 3 weeks. Grammar & Arithmetic are my principal studies but expect to begin Phalosophy to morrow and don't know but that I shall study Algebra some . Edwin goes to school up in town.  I believe that he a letter from Erasmus this last week and I suppose that he will answer it and inform you about his proceedings himself.

I came to Montague May 10th ( in the stage and had a pleasant ride) and went to cousin Eliza Webster's and staid untill Monday morning some past 6 o'clock when Mr. Payne the agent of the district came to carry me to have the sentence passed upon me. I felt somewhat timid as you can readily imagine being amongst strangers and having to appear before 2 clergymen and another gentleman. However I made out much better than I expected and we made our way to the schoolhouse and I guess my heart beat as much as once or twice as I entered it; but I got along first rate and have what I call a pretty large school. I have 29 different ones besides two or three more that I expect will come some. I have 4 in Adams Arithmetic, 9 in Colburns, 4 in Grammar, 11 in Geography, and 12 that write, and 5 small ones which read lost in fold of page edge the spelling book I am kept pretty much busy. Do not like lost in fold of page edge make their pens very well. I have one scholar that is larger than I am but not so old.

It is a pleasure of which I would not be denied. It gives me real delight to think of the many happy hours we have spent together and I, too, not infrequently think of the many of many sad and trying hours we have passed together and must say that the recollection of them, in one point of view, gives me pleasure, for I think we have learned a lesson from them we may not soon forget. I feel to regret the many hours we have been separated and still more the many during which we shall be separated; but hope that each one of us, both brothers and sisters, though deprived of a father's council forever, and far away from the soothing words and kind admonitions","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40882,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/40882","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/89fd498245db64a62826c8a99a38e3ec.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/89fd498245db64a62826c8a99a38e3ec.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/89fd498245db64a62826c8a99a38e3ec.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/89fd498245db64a62826c8a99a38e3ec.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T17:18:29+00:00","modified":"2020-06-08T20:58:55+00:00","filename":"89fd498245db64a62826c8a99a38e3ec.jpg","authentication":"c959eb30bb45f36d8f4ea2a897e2c46f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_041_008_02_o2.jpg","size":1519551,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2880,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048853877314815},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["235553"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["235553"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["235553"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"89fd498245db64a62826c8a99a38e3ec.jpg","FileDateTime":1509383344,"FileSize":1519551,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2880\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2880,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:26 15:14:38","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:24 23:55:53","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:24 23:55:53","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3352,"ExifImageLength":4189,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":175,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/175","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"of a dear mother, separated from each other, and alone as it were in the world, will choose that which will be for our best interests, which will enable us to occupy an honorable station in the world, so that when we leave it for a better one, it may be said of us, that \"it is better for our having lived in it.\" Dear brother don't you wish we could enjoy some of those pleasant evenings this winter which we enjoyed two years since, in strolling through the streets of Albany?

It came off with great eclat. Our Seminary was trimmed beautifully, recitations, compositions, Music and Colloquy, excellent. Nearly two hundred people were present, among them seven ministers. We had much praise bestowed upon us for our exertions during the past term. Will send you an order of the excursions on that day as soon as I get time to prepare one. Am at home now and expect to spend two or three weeks here. Shall not teach at Pembroke this fall I suppose. Had a letter from Raymond on Thursday last and he wrote me that they were trying to establish a school for females in connection with the University and if they did should want my services; would let me know soon and if they concluded to have one it would not commence until the first of September.

Can it be that four long weeks have elapsed since that time? and I promised you you should hear from me in a week or two at farthest; think you patience must be nearly exhausted by my delay, but you are teaching and know something  what teachers' cares and duties are and how much their time is occupied; therefore I trust you will pardon me. I miss the society and tender care of a brother very much; although Raymond is only six miles from here and comes to see me quite often, yet it is not like having one ( a brother) with me to whom I may open my heart when full and bid him read and with whom I can converse in my lonely hours. If brothers only knew the depth of a Sister's love and confidence they would yield to their wishes and seek their society more than many do; but I have no reason to complain of my brothers in this respect, far from it; they are ever kind and ready to assist their Mother or sisters and even make great self denials to do it; would that I had better opportunities of proving to them my gratitude and love; no, I would not exchange them for any others that could be named. I often think how sad and lonely I should be, had I no brothers to confide in and to sympathise with me in my trials and labors.

You will laugh I imagine as much of not more when I inform you of how and when I arrived here as we did one evening at tea table when talking of my conveyance and introduction here; sometimes I burst out laughing myself when I think of my adventures from the time I left home until I reached Lebanon.  You recollect I suppose of seeing me safely deposited in the stage on the 27th with the intention of reaching my destined place that night, but it was \"no go\"; when I reached Bellows Falls who should I meet there but Raymond, coming after me; as I did not come and had not written him he did not know what to make of it; was afraid I was sick and was on his way to a ascertain the facts in regard to the matter. Well as a natural consequence, of course, he must go and see Abby and I must go with him as we were so near and delay going to Lebanon until the next day (Friday). Accordingly we went to Rockingham and took dinner and in the afternoon we all went down to Papermill Village and found the folks very glad to see us. Mr. Emerson was there and probably knew we were as we were around making a number of calls, but did not show himself. Miss Gay had just left - P.M.G. she had been spending a week at his father's, he (Emerson) has gone to Wilmington, Deleware. But to proceed with the description of my journey; Friday morning we started from R____  and reached here at night - somewhat tired I'll assure you, but notwithstanding I must have an introduction to my boarding people and the Principals, before I could rest myself, which was soon over with. I was very lonely during the first week, but am quite happy now as I have got considerably acquainted.

At nine o'clock Andrews Latin Lessons, half past Olmsted's Natural Philosophy (class of eight gentlemen), half past ten Geography of the Heavens (large class), at eleven Davies First Lessons in Algebra (about twenty), quarter before twelve French Grammar and Exercises. P.M. At two second class in Grammar and Parsing, half past Telemaque, three Smellie's Natural History, half past Corinne?, four Abercrombie's Intellectual Philosophy. On Wednesday afternoons the young ladies meet me and read their compositions; there is about thirty of them. School numbers seventy. Alas! it is Thursday night and this scribbling to you is not finished yet and you are wondering why Sister Sarah don't write you, but I have sit down with a determination to finish this and write another letter to night- as I am much more at liberty this eve than I have been before this week. Sabbath eve after I commenced to write you was interrupted by a caller. Monday we also made a call and received one, Tuesday eve corrected twenty compositions, Wednesday eve attended a lecture and to night - have told you what I am going to do. There are three churches here and regular preaching at each. The Universalist is very prettily finished (I attend this) there is a good & large society and the preaching excellent. I wish you could listen to it with me sometimes, it is so elevating and soul-stirring. The Academy is in the hands of this society. Rev. Mr. Mason (our minister) is associate Principal in the school and a smart and good man he is; he has no recitation however, is acquainted with all the modern languages and will teach them if any wish.

It is a delightful day and Nature seems to be in her gayest mood; everything is replete with life and happiness. It forcibly reminds me of the Sabbath - just three year ago at this time on which you dear brother and myself strolled to the west part of the city of Albany. What a delightful prospect presented itself to our view  - how animated we were by the scene! Methinks I am even now by your side watching that beautiful stream coursing its way through the deep ravine below us or sitting with you upon the fresh, green grass under a wide spreading tree looking with delight upon the city and distant hills. Neither can you have forgotten the Sabbath upon which we crossed the Hudson and spent hours walking upon its banks, or the morn upon which I left Albany for my childhood's home.  It seems to me that I never saw Nature so lovely, or her scenery so beautiful as it was from there to Troy.  Recollect you how a noble steamer swept the waters of the Hudson at our right as it to outrun us? Many sweet remembrances have I, dear brother treasured up within my soul of times spent with you in admiring Nature's works. My heart is filled to overflowing as I contemplate them. Would you were here to walk with me to night, for you enjoy such scenes, you love the beautiful and surely we have it all around us here.

In the morning we were occupied in school, in the afternoon we had a walk and the evening the young ladies and gentlemen spent with me at my boarding place The refreshments consisted of various kinds of nuts, raisins and apples. One of the ladies crowned me \"queen of May.\" We had a very happy time. I had fear when I came here last fall that I should not remain so long or succeed as well. I feel that a great responsibility is resting upon me and that I am young to occupy such a station, but I try to do well and conduct myself so that my influence shall be good and trust I succeed in some degree. I understand that Miss Woodbury is coming here to school this summer; shall be glad to see her. Miss Barber from Wardsboro, VT has been here this spring and intends staying through the two next terms. I attended school with her at Swansey - Think there will be quite a number from Swansey way here this fall. Write soon. Your ever loving Sister Sarah J. Kendall","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40903,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/40903","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8b51cce3076172ba28016621687f926d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8b51cce3076172ba28016621687f926d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8b51cce3076172ba28016621687f926d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8b51cce3076172ba28016621687f926d.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T17:19:30+00:00","modified":"2020-06-15T22:50:56+00:00","filename":"8b51cce3076172ba28016621687f926d.jpg","authentication":"b3d70199be22dae8ffa9d04d38cc6ac3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_041_013_04_o2.jpg","size":1300198,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

I Suppose you and Lydia each have received a letter from us since you wrote last. Think  you can say you have heard from us as often as practicable since we have left home this time. I love to write home and love to receive letters from there and hope you and Sister will write us as often as possible. Am expecting to hear from her and Lucy Miller soon. Nathan is also expecting a letter from Edwin every day. We hear from Erasmus and Raymond too; they both write as though they were in good spirits. In regard to what you wrote about the proposals Raymond made you I want you to do what you think will make you happiest and be the best for you. I know Sister Abby is good and sincere in what she has written to you upon the subject and that she would do all she could to make you happy but I do not think Raymond is able now to take upon himself (I do not know to be sure how he stands in the world in regard to his pecuniary matters) what he proposes to you and I know your feelings too well to think you would feel as independent there as you would to live by yourself and the difference existing between your religious views and theirs and being so far from the scenes and place of your past life might be sources of unhappiness to you, but you must weigh the subject - deeply and act as you think best. I think it would be best for Jesse perhaps to go and live with Brother R____ for then he would have some one to watch over him and protect him and I know he and Abby would be kind to him and do all they could for him; as for Myron- Nathan and myself will look after him.

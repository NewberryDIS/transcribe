They then transcribe the writing and take the Copy with them to have it read by a Person who can read. This work they do so well, that it is perfectly legible. It is done either with a Coal on a Skin, or a piece of bark, or the letters are scratched with a knife or flint.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":62091,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/62091","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/470d9a5836e0b1d2ac66b3de0f6524ba.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/470d9a5836e0b1d2ac66b3de0f6524ba.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/470d9a5836e0b1d2ac66b3de0f6524ba.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/470d9a5836e0b1d2ac66b3de0f6524ba.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-20T14:53:38+00:00","modified":"2020-10-19T13:41:28+00:00","filename":"470d9a5836e0b1d2ac66b3de0f6524ba.jpg","authentication":"4d38e1db99108db9b5efd98282f55605","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3089_00395_o2.jpg","size":1898128,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2966,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.059255762843086},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120615"],"TimeCreated":["132406"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120615"],"DigitalCreationTime":["132406"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120615"],"TimeCreated":["132406"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120615"],"DigitalCreationTime":["132406"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120615"],"TimeCreated":["132406"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120615"],"DigitalCreationTime":["132406"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"470d9a5836e0b1d2ac66b3de0f6524ba.jpg","FileDateTime":1521557524,"FileSize":1898128,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2966\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2966,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.6 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:07:30 11:07:33","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":194},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:15 13:24:06","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:15 13:24:06","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":45,"SubSecTimeDigitized":45,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":971,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/971","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"358\nThe before mentioned affair being concluded, and the Indians and Rangers therein engaged, being again returned to their respective homes; the Commandant \u2013 who kept in mind, our reply to his proposal (of sending us to Bethlehem,) which was: \"That, both from duty and affection, we could not resolve \u2013 nor did we think ourselves permitted, in the hour of trial, to forsake our scattered flock entirely:\" He now proposed: To send us safe to the Miami of the Lake where we might gather our scattered People, and settle under his protection.

William Edwards aged about 70 in 1801 at Goshen on the Muskingum, and David Zeisberger at the same place in 1808, while at Bethlehem in the same Year, the two venerable Missionaries, Grube and Youngman, were also called from hence to meet together in the presence of that Lord and Savior, whom they so faithfully served here below; to receive their reward of him.\n\n    It is remarkable, that these last three Venerable Missionaries, who at an early period of their lives, had entered into that service with the resolution to endure for Christs sake, all hardships, privations, persecutions and dangers which might befal them- and who indeed had, during long services, given proof of their firmness, by the numerous hardships and trials they had endured: should live to such advanced Ages, as they did, and therewith enjoy generally good health to the last.   Bernhard Adam Grube, who had been the first Missionary to the Delawares, and spoke their Language well, died at Bethlehem on the 20th of March 1808. aged 93 Years and three Months.

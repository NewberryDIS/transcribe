She allowed me to read the part of the letter wherein she described a visit we made some days ago to a nearby temple.  She described the scenery en route - the green fields, the shadowy hills & mts. in the distance - the villages thro' which we passed, the natives young & old whom we saw, and finally the temple & the god . warrior or goblin, I don't know which, roughly carved in outline upon the face of a huge rock. - I told her the story was beautifully written, that it was creditable as a lit. effort but I could not say much for its fidelity to the truth.  I am devoted to the truth always.  I am a regular Gadgrind for facts - grim, stern, incontestable facts.  I believe in the eternal verities, the actualities of this very realistic world.  I would not have the facts disguised by the illusions of fancy, or colored with the variegated hues of a rich imagination. - Lucy, as you know, while perfectly sincere, has such broad sympathies, such indulgent tolerance, & so much poetic inspiration, that she looks at things as it were thro colored glasses.  I look at them with the naked eye.  She sees beauty grace & virtue, where I see only ugliness, depravity & vice.  She see \"richness in dilapidation\".  I see dreary, disintegration. - Now my fidelity to the truth will not permit me to allow even her innocence & unconscious fallacies to be imposed on you as facts.

The instinct of danger, of the protection from mud, stone or sun-baked brick walls seem to be universal. - The streets are irregular in boundaries & on the surface.  There is no grade, no sidewalks.  The streets have hills valleys holes & ruts.  They are full of children, dogs, hogs, & piles of rubbish.  Old women sit in groups about the doorways leading into the compound.  They smoke long pipes & may be presumed to be gossiping about their neighbors.  I often wonder what they talk about.  It can't be about the fashions because there has been no change in the fashions for more than a thous. years.  It can't be about church sociables, tea or bridge parties or dances.  It cannot be about the romance of courtships or the ups & downs of affairs of love.

The natives have stripped off the leaves almost to the top, so that the long rows of the slender, stripped stalks, look like the serried ranks of an army of soldiers, their plumes nodding & waving in the summer air.  There are no fences, hedges or ditches separating the several patches.  They are one great field.  The surface of the country around here is varied; there are hills & valleys & plains; all under the highest cultivation.  The mountains in the distance are unusual in their appearance.

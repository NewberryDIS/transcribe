How pleased we are to receive your carte de visites by the hand of Rev. Mr. Thomas.  We might almost fancy you were indeed in our midst. We do not know how to thank you enough for them. I wish we could make you some return, but we have none prepered to send just now except brother Eddie's and mine, and perhaps you would rather have some a little different from cousin Lizzie's as you can see those whenever you go to Denbigh. I wish very much that father and mother would be induced to accept your very kind invitation & visit you. I think it would refresh them much. but it seems to them a very great undertaking, and there are always obstacles unclear in the way of their leaving home to oppose any ordinary inducements. Mr. Griffiths Gahedydd Banner was done last Sabbath and portrayed the transit over the ocean in very pleasing colors, and said all the difficulties of the journey would end with their arrival at New York City. but I am afraid it would take a good many letters and more calculation than they have time to get them started. Why cannot you come out here, dear Uncle, we would be Oh! so glad to see you, and perhaps if you came safely out, father and mother might return with you, though I think that doubtful they are both so often ill, mother especially is often sick. Uncle Henry's health tho is now much improved. I was at his house soon after we received your letter and he was then quite sick but he is nearly as well as usual, I think now & his hair is very grey. We send you a lock of father's and mother's hair that you may see how much it has whitened. \nwritten upside down in ink and crossed out with a large X:\nRemsen June 15,65 \nDear Brother, \nPlease to lay? $350 of Mr. Miller's money on the $7 30\/100 Bonds for us - and retain the $50 toward our account.

You ought to have seen it. I was ironing and though I gave myself great credit for not leaving my work, and answering your note immediately, I must confess that some wrinkles dried into the clothes, as every now and then I left them spread on the table while I went to take a fresh peek at your dear face. Each tried to claim you as a nearer relation then the rest by saying that you looked like her, but Lizzie I carried the palm for when we showed him the likeness and you know the proverb Children and fools always speak the truth but Cousin Alexander had the good sense to remark that you looked some like me. I thanked him, and told him I couldn't get many to say so, and he replied that you certainly did. I am afraid you will think it a doubtful compliment to yourself after you have seen my face! Dear cousin I really thank you very much for it, and gladly concede to your wish and return you mine. I also send you one of brother Eddie's, your dear father's namesake. I wish you would write to him sometime, cousin. He says he never will be illustrious as a letter writer, and in truth has so modest an estimate of his abilities in that line that he would hardly be induced to begin a correspondence, but I know a letter from you would be highly prized, and I think it would receive an answer. unclear let him think it was his likeness that brought your letter and not my solicitation. He left permission when he was home for his photograph to accompany mine, so you see it is his gift. We think Uncle's and cousins photographs very good indeed.  Uncle's likeness is so small that we need to look through an eye glass to have it appear very lifelike. Then it seems almost ready to speak, but deer me, I cannot feel satisfied with just seeing your portraits I want to see and know you all. It seems to me that unclear north is most inconveniently large.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":32590,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/32590","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b6bdeef0a64105b5a07b598814e6848d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b6bdeef0a64105b5a07b598814e6848d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b6bdeef0a64105b5a07b598814e6848d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b6bdeef0a64105b5a07b598814e6848d.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-10T14:29:05+00:00","modified":"2020-08-27T18:06:15+00:00","filename":"b6bdeef0a64105b5a07b598814e6848d.jpg","authentication":"b417b8bba9fc752069e4019ad27ada47","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_14_fl_548_035_001_o2.jpg","size":1049962,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2393,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040626286545635},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160902"],"TimeCreated":["001039+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160902"],"TimeCreated":["001039+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20160902"],"TimeCreated":["001039+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b6bdeef0a64105b5a07b598814e6848d.jpg","FileDateTime":1507645571,"FileSize":1049962,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2393\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2393,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:09:08 10:50:21","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:09:02 00:10:39","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:09:02 00:10:39","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":30,"SubSecTime":0,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"SubSecTimeDigitized":0,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1817,"ExifImageLength":2733,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":138,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/138","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"New York Oct 3rd\/71 \n\nMy dear sweet friend \n\n Your very welcome letter has come at last and I am glad oh, so glad to hear from you again.

dear brothers and sisters. Do you remember that when the prophets of Baal were verily calling upon him to honor their sacrafice Elija told them to cry aloud, for he was either deaf or he was asleep or on a journey. Now he did this to mock them for you know that Baal was no God, if he had been a God, he would have heard the faintest whisper. No where in the scripture do we see it hinted that the great and living God can hear a loud cry any plainer than the gentlest sigh.

I cannot tell you how many letters I have written in my thoghts, each one different from the preceeding.\n\noverwritten from the top in pencil:\nLewis' children have grown much since you saw them, Robbirt's Henry is quite tall. Oninie, too is tall and thin Maggie is very light, not heavier than our great-fat baby but she is a plump healthy looking girl. The greatest chatterbox in the family yet, I believe, not excepting myself. Ownie is a great leader, Robbie reads quick well too, and Maggie has been saying for a year or two that it will take her two years to learn her letters, and it bids fair to, although she went to school all last sumer, though of course not very regularly, for she seems no nearer knowing them than she did before she commenced going to school last Summer. Jennie Griffith J.R.G's duaghter taught our school last summer Mary Ann Pierce we think will teach it this summer. Mrs Humphry Pugh told me a long time ago that if she had not forgotten your promise to write to her. She has long been looking for a letter. Anna and I took tea over to Store Felan the other day. David Price is now the Librarian for the district and we borrowed some books from the Library. We had a pleasant time. They expressed much sympathy for you as od all your friends to whom we have spoken of your bereavement. Laura Griffiths was here serving soon after your letter came and I read it to her.

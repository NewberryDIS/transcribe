Christmas P. M.\nI did not keep School to day partly on acct of its being Christmas a few families were opposed to its keeping & I shall not probably have to make up the time. I have been to the Dedication of the new Unitarian Meetinghouse at Lechmere Point and have heard a discourse delivered by Rev. Dr. Lowell of Boston very much more to my mind than Dr. Channing's N. Y. Sermon.  It was I believe sincerely intended to conciliate and not alienate. Text \"And the Disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.\"  He spoke as decidedly as could well be expressed in favor of Missions foreign & domestic.  The expression is too cold to say I have no objection to them but with the greatest emphasis he sd.? I do admire [[underlined twice] the man who from proper motives would go to proclaim the Gospel to the heathen.  He sd however that he was pained to hear of Calvinistic Missions & Arminian Missions &c.  On my return from the Dedication a sleigh very fully loaded with Passengers passed us.  After they had got some distance from us Esq. Whipple happened to see me & next? called to me & said there was a letter for me.  I turned my course & came by Col. Metcalfs where I found yours of the 22.  Getting it just as I did enables me to answer it this afternoon & I hope to see Gen G. this evening & send this & some dirty clothes by him -- but tis uncertain.  I shan't need to have you send any more clothes to me.  I am glad I have begun upon the last half of my time.  Is? this being glad time passes so swiftly.  After writing my last which you will probably receive on thursday I found I found I had not answered yours by Mr. Peirce but I learn by yours to day that A]meida has learnt to Braid Palm leaf & I should think it well if she has not paid too dear for her skill.  I can't get much information about the price of them. Mr. Cutler says he bought one for his father 2 yrs. ago for Dollar.  Thinks they are cheaper now.  It seems there is about 3 no's I believe of the Mis. Herald which you have not found. I have not got any bound yet & shall wait a little longer. The applesauce &c. has arrived. Col. M. asked me to take tea with him the other day so he? we have got some very good applesauce -- It was however before he had tasted of it -- they had just opened it.  I hope to send you the black linen thread by Gen. G.  You had better give me some more instructions before I get the other things.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101566,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101566","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/cebc0d578982dc45b85f9a772d373edf.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/cebc0d578982dc45b85f9a772d373edf.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/cebc0d578982dc45b85f9a772d373edf.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cebc0d578982dc45b85f9a772d373edf.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:54:22+00:00","modified":"2020-07-27T01:28:07+00:00","filename":"cebc0d578982dc45b85f9a772d373edf.jpg","authentication":"cd4a730ed11fc95a70f8db77cc46b635","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_148_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1753350,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3075,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.052795844625113},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035507"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035507"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035507"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cebc0d578982dc45b85f9a772d373edf.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920053,"FileSize":1753350,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3075\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3075,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:41:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 03:55:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 03:55:07","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3108,"ExifImageLength":3638,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I expect Gen G. will take some tracts for Charles if he wants them if not I will keep them.

I wrote to him at Westfield as you will see by this request, but I think it extremely doubtful if he gets it at all there, even if he should go to Westfield at all.  Most likely he will be back at Bangor before this letter will reach Westfield. I think I have written to you pretty abundantly since I have heard from you at all.  In fact if Eliab is there when you get this letter you may consider it as written to him especially, and expect to write to me some yourself; as with my pressure of business, and lack of conveniences, it can hardly devolve upon me to do all the writing.  Just consider my case:  The country is almost barbarous.  The houses generally poorer than every thing you ever saw:  Even Wealthy Menlast two words underlined  {that is men owning their hundreds of acres of Corn & Wheat, and heads of Cattle, horses, & hogs, almost literally unnumbered, will live here in one room log houses, really poorer than a decent man would keep his hogs in at the East.  The only lights at night is a burning rag in a dish of hog fat, perhaps! and every other thing in the same proportion.  To be sure we intend to carry a supply of indispensiblesunderlined with us.  My usual writing apparatus is a little desk or box, on my knees and I usually select the log barn, {probably would be called at the East a penunderlined rather than even a barnunderlined; a real Yankee barn for a stopping place would be a luxury indeed { or get under our big baggage wagon to write.  Then again the matter of timeunderlined for writing is a material matter.  We intend to work in the field as much of the time as men can work;  then all the rest of the time is just about enough to do up the necessary writing & calculations.  The men usually drop down & sleep in bed or floor, generally with their clothes on.  They enjoy themselves and are extra healthy in this way.  After finishing my writing, I bathe thoroughly, and sleep usually in the Wagon or perhaps barn floor, or open Porch on a straw bed & fixings which I keep in the wagon for my especial benefit.  In the matter of food we are especially lucky  You see the food of \"Suckers\"underlined consists regularly of three things.  Corn bread, smoked hog, and strong Coffee.

Ecles?, Susan Carpenter and many others I have heard say \"they wished they could get Miss Rich again, but it was a very hard school and low wages, and they certainly could not blame her if she should be unwilling to come.\"  All with one accord say their children never learned so much in any three Sumers before &c. &c.  Mr. Stevens is going to offer more wages they say in order to induce you to come.  10\/6 and if that would not do, more still.  But Mrs Foss said that they would have been glad to give you 10\/6, or two dollars even, at the mill last Sumer & they would probably give the same this sumer; that would be an easier school to teach, & near home too.  We have not heard a word from home, and I don't know yet but you are going to Bangor! -- But if you do not and wish to teach somewhere it seems to me that you can get an easier school at higher wages than this; and I cannot help advising you not to come.  Nevertheless you know best.

I believe it is expected of me that I should write about two letters to any of my brothers or sisters one to me. You especially, I must say, appear to be remarkably remiss in this matter.  Now I really think you ought to write me a regular sisterly letter about once in a month.  It is you know quite a difficult matter for a young man to properly 'take heed to his steps', especially if he be a College Student, and College Students are generally supposed to be.  Now how much good it must do such an one to have Sisters watching and writing to him, taking care of him & c.  Why, I sometimes think I can tell by a Students' conduct and appearance whether he has Sisters to write to him occasionally.

Capt John Childe of Springfield Mass. is appointed Chief Engineer - to begin the surveys of location immediately; He was desirous of taking out with him a large party of Assistants from here. He sent up an express to J.L. Leonard, a co worker of mine on the Vt. & Mass., and a former pupil of Capt. C's, to see him at Springfield the next morning, and offering him a situation. The opening appeared to me a very favorable one - the longest projected Rail Road in the Country - good salaries & permanent employment for five or six years at least.  I could be well recommended to Capt. Childe, and as I expected then to be through here in a month or two, I thought it best to go down and see. I found however the numbers all made up at once; though the Capt Childe appeared to like my appearance, and held out the prospect of a favorable situation there sometime in the future. So I did not go to Alabama, and returned to Vt & Mass.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101584,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101584","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/41381ae7af543877315e29cca5d650f5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/41381ae7af543877315e29cca5d650f5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/41381ae7af543877315e29cca5d650f5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/41381ae7af543877315e29cca5d650f5.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:54:47+00:00","modified":"2020-07-27T01:28:08+00:00","filename":"41381ae7af543877315e29cca5d650f5.jpg","authentication":"48f61b2a3a6eda62f5b3fab9bb2c6d4b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_150_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1827491,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2862,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.059123735020835},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035742"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035742"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035742"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"41381ae7af543877315e29cca5d650f5.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920054,"FileSize":1827491,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2862\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2862,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:42:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 03:57:42","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 03:57:42","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3005,"ExifImageLength":3779,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"But Leonard did conclude to go off to Alabama, and to start in three or four days only! Months rather than days are properly requisite for an Engineer to get out of his business and leave it in anothers hands, - but his connection with the road was such that he could not well be kept when he had determined to go. Somebody must take his place. It was certainly not a slight mark of confidence in an Engineer only a year old to put him into such a situation.  But so it was: and a pretty place it was too, I assure you!\nThis stepping into another man's shoes, when he is an Engineer, is a difficult business any time. In this case somewhat peculiarly so. Leonard is one of those strong headed men, without much education, or any system, keeping every thing in his own head without committing to paper, or any thing permanent. Some natural way of his won of doing things, but without rule or record of them, or any way hardly for another to understand what had been done, was doing, or was to be done.\nHis Note Books were only pencilled, badly written & worse spelled, half illegible, & frequently all erased.  He seems to keep it all in his mind, and somehow work along through his business. Such confusion & vexation I never got into. Why I could hardly even dream peaceably o'nights, would wake up every half hour with my brains all snarled up on some point or other. But I am now getting to feel very comfortable again; persevering diligence is beginning to bring order out of Chaos, and I have a fair prospect of succeeding admirably.

The Vermont & Mass R.R. you know is completed to Brattleboro. After much delay until I got most out of patience, though I ought not to complain as my wages went steadily on. I got fairly away from Vt. & Mass. March 19th, and at Boston, on my way Down East, entirely out of business and perhaps with little prospect of any immediately in these dull \"Money Crisis\" times for Rail Roads. The next day, R.R. traveling being cheap for Engineers, I found myself at the N.H. City of Manchester, thinking to call upon a friend of mine at Epping N.H. on my way to Portland. Being at Manchester, I called, though with scarcely a thought of Employment, upon the Chief Engineer of the N.H. Central R.R. a new Rail Road just beginning from Manchester N.H. to Winsor Vt. The N.H.C. happened to be just then in want of Engineers, I happened to be recommended from the Vt. & Mass. as perhaps few are recommended, and was snapped up shortly. I was really disappointed instead of Bangor as I expected, the same week I left Vt. & Mass R.R. found me regularly situated on the N.H. Central. A situation too such as all young Engineers do not get. I have Engineer in Charge, Sec. Div. N.H. R.R.  12 miles long is the Div. in Towns of Goffstown and Weare. Hillsboro' Co. N.H. Salary $720.00 per Annum. As the Road is to be a long one & only part of it commenced upon I may perhaps have employment here if I choose for two or three years. At any rate the situation is better than building Plank Roads in Wisconsin; better for me as an Engineer, even if I could get $1000.00 or even $1500.00 per year there. Here I am getting ahead every day, learning gaining ground all the time, both in ability, and in what is almost equally","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101588,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101588","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/0b7d6a553ff6ce7b2f8c094054e72416.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/0b7d6a553ff6ce7b2f8c094054e72416.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/0b7d6a553ff6ce7b2f8c094054e72416.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0b7d6a553ff6ce7b2f8c094054e72416.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:54:53+00:00","modified":"2020-08-22T04:09:12+00:00","filename":"0b7d6a553ff6ce7b2f8c094054e72416.jpg","authentication":"ab606a5be87a6be8203a295542edc230","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_150_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1639105,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2795,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.054300172265289},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035803"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035803"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035803"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0b7d6a553ff6ce7b2f8c094054e72416.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920054,"FileSize":1639105,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2795\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2795,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:42:39","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 03:58:03","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 03:58:03","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2961,"ExifImageLength":3813,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"necessary to the Engineer, reputation; while in Wisconsin, with the best situation I could expect I might be getting behing? in both. Rough, rugged New England, where they build Rail Roads that are Rail Roads, and with money too, is the school for Engineers. It will be some time before they will go to Wisconsin for Engineers, and an Engineer I bid fair to be.  All the letters I have from Bangor & Milo are complaining bitterly of you for not writing. Mother worried all wonder. Lucy makes a merit of consolation that if you were dead or very sick, somebody else would have written. The Last Advices is that Eliab saw a letter of yours to Miss Lizzie Doe. Now I think of it, perhaps my letter may be the bearer of the news to you, Charles has another Boy. It was born on Eliab's Birthday. Will they not name it after him? I am most afraid though that they will get \"Kittredge\" or \"Russel\" or some such horrible thing in with the Eliab.   I suppose they have written to you about Joseph's condition. I do not know as anything has ever so much saddened me. He thinks it is permanent, irremediable; says he is ? no more to be an action & mover in the world. It seems dreadful for one to be stopped so short, in the midst of days, one too like him, with such prospects of wealth, usefulness, and I think greatness, There are few young men like our Joseph. Others may judge as they please. Very few of my age, not a great many of any age, have a more extended acquaintance with young men than I have, and I certainly do not know a mind his equal. I am certainly successful in my undertakings. I am considered \"promising\", but with all my superior advantages, I can but feel that Joseph is my Superior. Taking such a man away from active life is a loss to Community. He has sold out his business to Thurston. The Doctors  after Bleeding, Blistering, & Strychnia till they were tired prescribe rest, total rest, & the Summer, he has quartered himself at Milo. If he is able to travel, I am going to get him here at any rate a while.   In answer to your letter, I am sorry to disappoint you, but however much I might enjoy a visit to Wisconsin, and however pleasant it would for us to be there together I think, under the circumstances, that I cannot come this Spring, though I mean to sometime, but it will probably be some time before I shall be Engineer of a Plank Road. I think too I might prefer building New England Rail Road","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101589,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101589","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7249d0d79044c3ee3baf637ebced4c36.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7249d0d79044c3ee3baf637ebced4c36.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7249d0d79044c3ee3baf637ebced4c36.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7249d0d79044c3ee3baf637ebced4c36.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:54:55+00:00","modified":"2020-07-27T14:52:04+00:00","filename":"7249d0d79044c3ee3baf637ebced4c36.jpg","authentication":"c7342ca8662cbebe4b5bcf7f8927a8a6","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_150_002_003_o2.jpg","size":1632467,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2842,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053185908463002},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035806"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035806"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035806"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7249d0d79044c3ee3baf637ebced4c36.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920054,"FileSize":1632467,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2842\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2842,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:42:41","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 03:58:06","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 03:58:06","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":54,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2996,"ExifImageLength":3795,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Bridges of Stone, or Howes' or Pratts Truss, to Wisconsin Plank Road Bridges of Logs.

Some very valuable horses, the whole 13 animals valued at over $1200.00  It was a bad sight to see the ruins, & the remains of the animals in the morning. The place, one mile from here, called \"Oil Mill Village\" in town of Weare, seems to be doomed, almost Last Fall a fire broke out there, consumed the Tavern, two stores, Grist Mill, Saw Mills, Rail Factory, Peg Factory, Machine Shop, Turning Lathe, Large Stables &c  In all fifteen or twenty buildings, all the business part of the Village, throwing dozens of men out of employ.

Sept. 16, 1849\n\nDear Sister Anne\n  Your letter of the twenty third ultimo was rather long in reaching me on on account of my present scattering condition. Being engaged on a Survey, and moving from place to place, my letters are directed all along the Line, and reach me just as it happens, sometimes by Stage Drivers, and some time not until some one is coming expressly to me. Your letters probably reached Goffstown ten days since, waited there about a week: and then reached me so full of business that I could hardly stop long enoug to read it until Sunday  You know that I did make the rule to answer your letter the next day after their receipt, but I could not this time.   You mention my visit home.  It was almost an  aggravation. You see I had got my business all arranged so I could be gone I thought some two or three weeks, and I would have a grand visit home and everything go on just as good in my absence &c.   Well I got started, got down to Manchester and there found our President of Board of Directors, N.H.C.R.R. wanting to see me on special business! Somewhat vexations to be sure, but rather flattering withal for so young an Engineer to be selected over the heads of other & older ones whose business it most appropriately was, to make a very important and very difficult Survey. Mr Price said they wanted someone there in whom they had full confidence, so that the same Engineer who made the survey could remain on the work in building. Rather flattering, wasn't it? besides implying the promise of an excellent situation for two or three years, for the Line is over a very difficult country, which will take a long time to build, and be exactly the very best school for a young Engineer. They wanted I should commence the Survey immediately but I finally, not to lose the visit entirely as I was started, got away for a few days, just had time to go home & see Joseph & come right back again.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101592,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101592","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5ec3f9783d83e56dc6569423b8878ffb.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5ec3f9783d83e56dc6569423b8878ffb.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5ec3f9783d83e56dc6569423b8878ffb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5ec3f9783d83e56dc6569423b8878ffb.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:54:59+00:00","modified":"2020-08-22T04:11:18+00:00","filename":"5ec3f9783d83e56dc6569423b8878ffb.jpg","authentication":"84729eb4bce89f237f106b21f64a1622","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_150_003_002_o2.jpg","size":1473519,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2370,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057568330989217},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035836"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035836"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035836"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5ec3f9783d83e56dc6569423b8878ffb.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920054,"FileSize":1473519,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2370\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2370,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:42:47","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 03:58:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 03:58:36","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3070,"ExifImageLength":4663,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"It is now some more than four weeks since I began upon the Survey. It was certainly rather a difficult situation to put a Young Engineer with so little Experience as I had into.  It worried me a good deal at first; I used to dream of the Mountains & Lakes, & curves and grades &c. &c. all the night.  However I believe I have got along very well; certainly far exceeding my own expectations and I believe to the full satisfaction of my Employers and chiefs.  We shall probably get through the Field Work of the Survey nearly in two weeks more. Then perhaps there will be a month or two of Office Work to collate & arrange the facts obtained & draw the Plans & Profiles, and to make out estimates. It is to be considered that this Survey which I have had the honor of making is a line through word crossed out the most difficult part of New Hampshire, a regular Mountain route. Route by way of Sunapee Mountain & Lake, and among other difficulties? involving quite a tunnel. If it had been a rich Company, the Engineer selected to make the Survey would have been one with the highest & most established reputation in the country.  Instead you see being poor, they select a promising Sub, in whom they have full confidence!!!   There is some splendid scenery in this country. I never saw anything like it before. Mountains & Lakes are thrown together most promiscuously on all sides. Sunapee Lake is a most splendid sheet of water, stretching round some ten or fifteen miles long among the mountains. Our Summit is a ridge of Rock connecting two mountains & extending across at the End of the Lake. Our Rail Road will make a great hole through it! The Lake is beautiful, clear & transparent as spring water.  How I love to play in its Waves & miniature Surf these fine windy evenings. It has been rather a wild rude country we have been in mostly. The little old churches in the \"Villages\" have Free Will Baptist or Christian preaching once in four weeks or two weeks.

In truth, though I suppose I have had quite an extensive acquaintance with school girls, having had probably the pleasure of teaching several hundreds between the ages of 17 & 35, and have met a few since. Yet I do not seem ever to have had much opportunity of acquaintance with Ladies.  Certainly I have never become acquainted with any to suit me, at least not any who were not either already married or \"engaged\" to be   4th \"Demonstrations\"  Do pity my ignorance and innocence!

I had been expecting it for some time before.  Well - I hardly know what to write. What do you want to hear about?  We are plodding along here, after steady & quiet fashion. Lets us see -  When I last wrote you I guess I was off on the Survey. Searching for Rail Roads, or places to put them, among the Mountains, and Lakes, the quiet valleys & rocky hillsides of Western New Hampshire. We finished the Survey and got back to old quarters here about the first of October,  being our a little less than two months. I did certainly enjoy it. Such an active life agrees much with me. There were many splendid places among those Mountains & Lakes  Any lover of Nature must enjoy such scenery. To be sure I had hardly time or chance to enjoy nature much, and some might perhaps say that in such business & looking out for such purposes one could hardly enjoy Nature at all.  Looking so constantly at the practical, utilitarian value or use of everything: the benefits or advantage of a sandy flat here, or a rounded valley or hill side there;  estimating the difficulties & the expense, of the ledge here, the hill there, or the ravine or the mountain stream beyond, and contriving modes & schemes of avoiding or overcoming them.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101596,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101596","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/a3222228e3b9e5d92204d8c3bf32cbda.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/a3222228e3b9e5d92204d8c3bf32cbda.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/a3222228e3b9e5d92204d8c3bf32cbda.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a3222228e3b9e5d92204d8c3bf32cbda.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:55:04+00:00","modified":"2020-07-29T01:20:23+00:00","filename":"a3222228e3b9e5d92204d8c3bf32cbda.jpg","authentication":"2dd3a847599340b9af8e6d361cd30e6c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_150_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1614473,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2869,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.052104649961917},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035856"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035856"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035856"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a3222228e3b9e5d92204d8c3bf32cbda.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920054,"FileSize":1614473,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2869\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2869,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:42:55","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 03:58:56","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 03:58:56","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2999,"ExifImageLength":3762,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Still the business is certainly extremely pleasant  The cares are not corroding.  The difficulties of nature and the troubles of overcoming them are not vexations as are those of Art, or of intercourse with mankind. There is mental labor connected with it, enough I assure you. I never had my mind tasked more severely or more constantly than on that Survey. I had perhaps to begin with hardly the knowledge or the experience usually required in one selected for so important a trust.  But it seemed that those in authority had full confidence in my abilities and I could not well back out without trying. As it was, I found I learned wisdom & experience every day and became fitted for duties as they devolved upon me; and in the end succeed far better than I anticipated and to the full satisfaction of those interested. It was an excellent thing for me. The acquirements & the experience gained will be almost invaluable. Much money could not obtain the worth of the confidence in my self, my own powers & abilities to overcome difficulties which it has given me.   There is considerable truth in your ideas about my employment as not being a favorable one is a social point of view. I feel it, I think, more & more.

It is indeed very possible that I may soon be out of business, and have leisure enough. This New Hampshire Central Rail Road Company are at present very much pressed for want of money, almost unable to struggle along anyhow; obliged to curtail very much, and indeed if they do not get help soon, liable to be obliged to suspend operation entirely.

I suppose they can hardly tell whether the treatment benefits him or not. I do not believe that he will stay there a great while longer.  They are getting the East part of the house at Milo finished off in good shape I expect.

I do like him & his wife very much. I have also written to Warwick occasionally & receive answers from Maria, who is the only one who writes. But I have understood that Aunt Esther hopes I shall not marry Cousin Maria\u00a0!!! wherest I am greatly frightened.  It is really amusing how people {the great foolish many} I suppose having nothing in their heads to think of, will keep thinking & talking of that subject of matrimony. Nine out of ten seem to have no other  idea in their heads.  Sometimes it is amusing, sometimes ridiculous, sometimes vexations. A young man in my situation it seems cannot speak to a lady without it being town talk & I verily believe if I should break my leg it would not excite so much feeling or curiosity as if I should order my horse and ride off of an evening, without telling where. It is quite amusing to witness & feed such curiosity","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101599,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101599","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7d19b2236111b158cdde794be58e704a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7d19b2236111b158cdde794be58e704a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7d19b2236111b158cdde794be58e704a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7d19b2236111b158cdde794be58e704a.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:55:09+00:00","modified":"2020-08-22T04:15:40+00:00","filename":"7d19b2236111b158cdde794be58e704a.jpg","authentication":"b5a7d12ea8ccb6763b411fc70ba3b9d1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_150_005_001_o2.jpg","size":1729844,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2795,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057306168422447},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035912"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035912"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035912"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7d19b2236111b158cdde794be58e704a.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920055,"FileSize":1729844,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2795\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2795,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:43:01","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 03:59:12","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 03:59:12","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2958,"ExifImageLength":3809,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Milo, Maine, April 10th, 1850\n\nDear Sister   Your letter, which I had been long expecting was received here about a few days since: Via Goffstown, things remailed to Bangor and here.

Thinks he grows a little weaker than he was two or three months ago.ne. Is taking the Homeopathic Medecines. Enjoys himself comfortably, reading, writing, playing Backgammon, talking & lounging. Mother appears to enjoy very good health this Spring, though she will persist in washing and doing all the hard work she can get a chance to.  I wish you would write to her a good sound doctrinal letter on that topic, rebuking her nicely.  Charles is just the same as usual, clever as corn, but a little lazy. Albina is taking care & pride of Charley; who under the various aliases of \"Chuck\", \"bud\", \"Mischief\", \"Tim\", \"Stubborn\" and others too numerous to mention, is one of the very best little fellows ever seen, busy as a bee, good natured as a bird, and obstinate as a Mule; bright as a dollar, but wont talk without he chooses, or gets cornered and cant help it.  Almeda is comfortable.  Lucy is dull, James is lazy, constitutionly so like Charles. Lizzie writes the height of precosity with the height of simplicity. For myself I am busied with the greatest multiplicity of occupations ever imagined, but generally reducible to the one great head of Loafing.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101600,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101600","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/1c0339940a8a4a1803b1e84e3285df9b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/1c0339940a8a4a1803b1e84e3285df9b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/1c0339940a8a4a1803b1e84e3285df9b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1c0339940a8a4a1803b1e84e3285df9b.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:55:10+00:00","modified":"2020-08-22T04:16:17+00:00","filename":"1c0339940a8a4a1803b1e84e3285df9b.jpg","authentication":"b6175576f6393fb0f9f7d9d2285c859e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_150_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1799369,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2773,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.060082308236834},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035919"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035919"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035919"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1c0339940a8a4a1803b1e84e3285df9b.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920055,"FileSize":1799369,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2773\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2773,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:43:03","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 03:59:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 03:59:19","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2945,"ExifImageLength":3823,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I have no[w] been at home nearly four weeks.

March 9 1851. AD.\nDear Sister Anne,\nA letter from you was received here by the last mail. Lucy maintains that she has written one letter to you that you had not received at the time you wrote. I do not know as I have anything to write but I can make a beginning.  It is Sabbath day, Mr Partridge has gone to be married, and there is no meeting today. Mother and I were going to Brownville to Church but the morning was a regular March Snowstorm; latterly the Sun has come out brilliantly and we talked of starting this afternoon but Mother says it is too late. So I am writing, Lucy is \"Lounging\", and Mother is looking at her Plants.\nDid they write to you how I made a trip in the woods with Samuel? We were gone two or three weeks, and went the rounds with a varied experience of Mountains, Rivers, Lakes, Woods, Camps, and all the et cetera of a Lumberman's life.\nI enjoyed the trip very much on the whole. I could enjoy life very well there, except the Sabbaths which are hard.\nSince then I have been helping Charles get up wood. We have got up more than a year's stock of good hard wood; more I  guess than he has often or perhaps ever had at the door at one time before. \n10th Mother & Lucy are commanding me to write more, but I do not know as there is any more to write. Lucy has said all the good things and more too. She plays Back Gammon excessively, and got well slowly\nMy name is Isaac\nWritten upside down at the top (but not all legible as the paper is ripped):\nam very glad you are so comfortably situated I would try to commence - ripped... - by all means act...as you have rem'em?

The meeting there this afternoon till 7 1\/2  So I went to the First Presbyterian, Rev Mr Curtiss. By no means as stylish either in Church, Audience or preacher. The sermon however was by a Rev Mr Root of Conn. quite an old fashioned gentleman.  There is to be a great Missionary Convention here in Chicago, Commencing next Thursday Evening with a Sermon from Edward Beecher, and continuing day and evening, over the Sabbath, at Second Presbyterian.  I shall not be here.  I expect to start Monday for Springfield Illinois  By Canal to LaSalle or Peru, Steamboat on Illinois River","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101607,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101607","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/85861df6d952da37cfe848cc59ecf4f1.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/85861df6d952da37cfe848cc59ecf4f1.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/85861df6d952da37cfe848cc59ecf4f1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/85861df6d952da37cfe848cc59ecf4f1.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:55:21+00:00","modified":"2020-07-31T15:43:25+00:00","filename":"85861df6d952da37cfe848cc59ecf4f1.jpg","authentication":"45e9dd0ac3983f2f2b23f4320890617a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_150_007_002_o2.jpg","size":1700067,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2772,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05678701699535},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["040011"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["040011"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["040011"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"85861df6d952da37cfe848cc59ecf4f1.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920055,"FileSize":1700067,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2772\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2772,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:43:19","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 04:00:11","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 04:00:11","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2848,"ExifImageLength":3698,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"to Naples, thence by Rail to Springfield.

Your plan of writing letters hastily and often is I think a very good one. It is one you know that I have always followed. I always scribble off a whole sheet perhaps of whatever comes upper most as fast as I can write, My letters of course are poor things, but they do not cost much either of time or effort. It is pleasant to hear frequently from friends, especially relatives even if they do not say anything very bright and when letters cost but three cents apeice it is hardly worth while to find fault with the quality. As far as your letters are concerned though I cannot see as the excellence of the style or matter is injured at all by the haste of writing.  I should think your French Correspondence with Eliab might be quite profitable as well as agreeable to both of you.   You are anxious about Eliab. I am and have been very much so.

My beautiful horse is dead. I really loved him, he loved me.  It pained me more than twice the worth of him to see him suffer. It would have affected any one to see him in his painful illness, strive so to lean his head against me, as if realising that I would help him if I could. Even when he could no longer stand he would reach his head round to get it to me.  I suppose he got poisoned. Night before last I stopped at Murphysboro, Jackson Co., where it is supposed that by some accident or carelessness, he got some seeds of the Castor Oil Plant, Castor beans they call them among his feed.  These beans are supposed extremely fatal to the horse, one of two only killing a horse at once. Yesterday morning he was as well as could be wished lively & merry as a bird, and this afternoon he died. He was a very promising young fellow, and perhaps worth a hundred dollars.   Well.  I am able to get another, but I would hardly see him suffer so for the worth of two such.   Why do you skip half of Macauley's England?

Antoinette however stoutly maintains that she fully expected something of the kind. I cannot stop now for congratulations, felicitations, or condolences, but now more simply to direct you the way to get here. For come here you must at any rate: we cannot & will not have it any other way. And it is perfectly easy to get here nowadays, and with very little trouble. At Peru you are in the same state and only two or three hundred miles from here. In one year more we will have a Railway, the Main trunk of the Illinois Central direct from Peru or La Salle here. Now you will have to go round a little, by way of St Louis. You take tickets at La Salle to St Louis, by way of Alton. The route is partly the Ill. Central & Partly the Chicago & Missippi.

After I do get through here I expect a vacation. You have not heard of the great \"something\" that didn't quite \"turn up\" in my case. You did probably hear of the celebrated \"Minnesota Land Bill\". Congress passed an Act making a great grant of Land to a Co. to build a great Rail Road in Minnesota. Afterwards an acc't of some supposed fraud repealed the act. That act established a great R.R. Co. which would have gone on with the best prospects of any new R.R. project in the Co.  Well; the Engineering was offered to our Chief Roswell B. Mason. He could not of course leave the ILL. Central at present; but was to have a sort of honorary charge of the new project, putting on Engineers of his selection, and over looking the Surveys and Locations. - And - I.S. Metcalf of 2nd Div. I.C.R.R.

July 8, 1855\nDear Sister Anne\nThey call this the North Western Metropolis, and I believe it is quite worth visiting. I have as yet seen nothing of the surrounding country, but have spent one day here: arrived here yesterday morning, and employed the day in looking about the town.  It does seem something like a Mushroom, or an exhalation that has sprung up over these bluffs in a night, and one almost feels almost anxious for the effects of a mornings sun upon it. Less than seven years ago this was all an untrodden Wilderness; Now a city of six or seven thousand inhabitants, and 15000 emigrants have arrived here already this spring. It is not altogether such an unsubstantial affair either. The really 'First Class Hotel where I am stopping cost $40.000.00 or $50.000.00. And there is another building this season  to cost $100.000.00.  There are two or three, perhaps more ten & twelve thousand dollar churches. I was a little surprised or amused at the sermon I heard this forenoon from Rev. E.D. Neil of the First Presbyterian Church. It was simply a Fourth of July Oration - a pretty good one for a Military celebration I should think. To be sure he took a text, but it was only to introduce his subject, and exactly that 'Righteousness Exalteth a Nation', but rather the glory of this nation in its rulers & founders especially Washington. Most of it in fact was simply a Eulogy of the Character of Washington  Very well in its way, but did not seem to me very much a sermon","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101629,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101629","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ca3595888b2799b09293723b411bb27d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ca3595888b2799b09293723b411bb27d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ca3595888b2799b09293723b411bb27d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ca3595888b2799b09293723b411bb27d.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:55:53+00:00","modified":"2020-08-05T17:56:48+00:00","filename":"ca3595888b2799b09293723b411bb27d.jpg","authentication":"33c236f194578ae81c33b3c1a6ba8657","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_150_013_002_o2.jpg","size":1662637,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2859,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053846754239374},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["040226"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["040226"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["040226"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ca3595888b2799b09293723b411bb27d.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920056,"FileSize":1662637,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2859\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2859,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:44:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 04:02:26","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 04:02:26","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3049,"ExifImageLength":3838,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"There is no afternoon service here until 8 P.M.

I think I have told you so before. It costs more and is less efficacious beside after the teeth have become so much decayed. I had mine filled three or four holes, two or three years since by a Dentist of Reputation in Brattleboro for $.50 per cavity. So I  should think you paid a pretty good price.\nAnother thing now I think of it, I want to give you a lecture upon the Subject of health, as I have lately to Eliab. There is perhaps no need of enlarging upon the excellence of the blessing, or the importance of preserving it generally; still you & Eliab do need warnings. With you as well as with Joseph there is a great fundamental defect of character\u00a0: the great primary preservation principle of Laziness. is almost entirely wanting. With Josepha hundred thousand dollars would not be a fair equivalent for the injury that defect has caused him. We cannot tell the extent of the injury already caused to Eliab; perhaps twenty years of life. You all started in life with a wrong principle, a wicked sinful principle: viz. that your own personal ease comfort & convenience, were of no sort of importance or at least secondary: instead of being as in truth the great principal all important thing. \"Self preservation is the first law of Nature.\" A benevolent God has implanted most minds sufficient Laziness & selfishness to secure this. In some few cases, either as a furnishment for sins of some preceding generations or to give opportunity of trial for a new triumph of Right reason over difficulties, He has withheld the Boon. It is your imperative moral duty to consider yourself of more value than many sparrows; your own ease comfort & feelings more importance than any else whatever. } I guess I will omit the remainder of this occasion until some future opportunity.\n Mother ordains that you come up here again as soon as possible.\nHow long I remain is uncertain; am liable to go about every other day.

I have cleansed the Augean Stables, and performed various other wonders upon the Old Book Case & Newspaper Shelves;  have burned up with fire, and sold for paper rags 100 cords old worthless books and papers; and should like to do the same by double quantity of old clothes etc. If I find some opportunity when Mother was out of the house.

I kept thinking that perhaps that you were worse and I did not hear of it for so long; and troubling myself among other things because I had not written as soon as I came down here to let all the folks know where I was.\n And now, though, I have heard once or twice since then that you were getting better nicely, yet I am quite anxious to hear again how you get along. Mother it seems has gone home to Milo, and Almeda come down to stay with you. Anne, I believe I understood from the latest letter had gone to Milo, or was going. I really want to see her; and mean to before long.\n Your little one is dead. I suppose it was hard parting with it, even though you had hardly time to begin to love it\u00a0: yet it always seems to me it is hardly right to mourn in such a case, the death of an infant. In one sense, is not the soul of that child a fortunate one?

You hardly realise perhaps how much he has failed since you saw him. He cannot now move his foot or turn in bed, without help etc.\n  All things considered, I have concluded to remain here until more especially obliged to leave.

Board of R.R. Commissioners, who were to decide the question, was held at Concord N.H. last week commencing on Tuesday. I was present as Engineer of the N.H. Central, for whom appeared as Counsel.  Josiah Quincy Jr. about the greatest R.R. Authority in N.E. assisted by other Surveyors etc. of less note. The Opposite side was managed by the celebrated Gen. Frank Pierce the hero of the Mexican War, and considered the most effective Reader that N.H. can furnish. On the whole it was quite an occasion.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101651,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101651","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/13b5fded27f69a4e536b87a5fe82d7a4.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/13b5fded27f69a4e536b87a5fe82d7a4.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/13b5fded27f69a4e536b87a5fe82d7a4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/13b5fded27f69a4e536b87a5fe82d7a4.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:56:25+00:00","modified":"2020-08-23T19:06:02+00:00","filename":"13b5fded27f69a4e536b87a5fe82d7a4.jpg","authentication":"d2c8054f1c143633111ee21e687897f8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_152_008_002_o2.jpg","size":1845153,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2806,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.060886493228795},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["233649"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["233649"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["233649"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"13b5fded27f69a4e536b87a5fe82d7a4.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920058,"FileSize":1845153,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2806\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2806,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:45:10","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 23:36:49","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 23:36:49","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3130,"ExifImageLength":4015,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"After all the matter was not finally settled, but a full decision was deferred until Nov. 13th.\n\n  The matter is however most like to go against our side.

At Mt table, Self, Edward Everett, & Alfred each busily writing letters. I have got a grand good party. I think by far the best I ever knew. Only eight of us now. I.S. M Edward Everett, S.C.L. Burnham, Abram Mitchell, George W. Mitchell, Alfred L. Holman, Gilman W. Johnson, and John Flaherty. Alfred is an excellent fellow; influence always on the right side I think. He says he wull give $50.00 towards it himself if they will build a Meeting house in Milo.\n\n I heard a grand preacher at Newport today.

So you see I intend to keep up my reputation as a faithful letter writer, if I do have less time and circumstance than the rest of you to do it.\n\n Our folks at Milo are really to blame in that regard I think. Joseph to be sure cannot write himself now, but there are enough others to write for him. It is strange that they had not written to you better than you say. Mother & Joseph have written to me a few times, one letter I received last week. Joseph insists that he is no better, in spite of Alfred's very direct Affirmation.  I do hope that he is almost imperceptibly recovering.\n Alfred I suppose you want to hear of. He is doing finely and I believe likes first rate. His low spirits did not last long after he begun to get acquainted with our fellows.

However I encouraged him up. he had a good night's rest, and feels pretty \"chirp\" today.\n  It seems they had written to me, from home before, but it going to Henniker, I have not yet received the Letter. Well I have got a grand party now, and feel pretty comfortable. It bothers me  though Joseph hardly wrote any thing by Alfred, and my brain is so full of every thing that I cannot think of what I want to ask Alfred, even if in the crowd I had time or chance.\n Well the dinner bell. pray do write to me\n\nI.S.M.C.E.

Soon Mother had much headache - vomiting - diarrhea. We think she is sickly yet. proof she does not talk very strong of washing tomorrow. Charlie also vomited & was sick. They soon said I was sickish, but I agreed with them so fully that they said I would not own it. Moreover strange to relate the infant baby who is not known to have eaten any Greens, vomited, and has been sick sundry days.

And careful not to over task your returning energies.\n\n Well, lots of lots of worthless rambling this is.\n\nWrite & constantly                                                                        Affectionately\n\n                                                                                                               I.S.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101678,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101678","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/cd5d2e8e181268b98a167d07ac715afb.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/cd5d2e8e181268b98a167d07ac715afb.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/cd5d2e8e181268b98a167d07ac715afb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cd5d2e8e181268b98a167d07ac715afb.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:57:03+00:00","modified":"2020-08-25T02:00:14+00:00","filename":"cd5d2e8e181268b98a167d07ac715afb.jpg","authentication":"e0255d71b24a75bba6b7d20f8a5c5847","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_153_005_001_o2.jpg","size":1819010,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2866,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058767219766871},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["234038"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["234038"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["234038"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cd5d2e8e181268b98a167d07ac715afb.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920059,"FileSize":1819010,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2866\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2866,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:46:20","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 23:40:38","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 23:40:38","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3145,"ExifImageLength":3950,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Jonesboro, Union Co.

I am inclined to think that I do rather more than my part of the writing for most all of you. Though to be sure I got in the habit of writing long letters with nothing in them. I write often when there is nothing to write, and oftener than I should, because I want to hear from you, and am afraid you will not write, if I do not.\n\nYou judge that I am in a good place, a place where there is room for a man to grow.\n\nThis is very true. There is room for a man to grow wherever there is room and opportunity for him to labor. Not the mere physical labor to be sure, like that of the brute; but a labor, or varieties of labor, demanding such intellectual effort as his mental state is equal to. And this it is usually far easier finding, even in the sphere in which every one finds himself, than most are apt to imagine.\nThere is here plenty of room to labor,  and plenty of room to grow. I am then & therefore very well situated here. I am likely, if I stay here to do well - to grow.

Everybody is sick more or less. Nine out of ten are sick really quite a proportion of the time.

A really healthy looking face, what we should call such at the East, is hardly to be seen. And just at this time, just after the Summer or Fall attacks of the Ague, and especially this Ague season, the \"Natives\" are the most miserable looking set of beings.

Nov. 9. 1851.\n\nDear Sister\n\n  Letters reached me on the 5 inst from Bangor and Milo. being one from you. Samuel & Eliab of Oct. 1. One from you of Oct. 4, and one from Mother and Eliab at Milo, Oct. 6-10  reaching here at once via Mt Hawkin's Post Office, Perry Co.\n You had all just heard of my Ague, sickness etc. and all troubled and advising me to leave here at once. Which would be no sort of use, the advice being a few months to late. I may just as well stay here this winter. It is a healthy country enough in the Winter Season.

It is rather queer, than very bad, perhaps in a very hot day, or sitting by a big fire, all wrapped up in clothes, to be shivering with cold for an hour or two, and without really feeling very cold either. Soon the patient commenced drinking a pailful or at least a pitcher full of water. and before long the cold & shivering gradually, almost imperceptibly, passes into a burning fever all over, usually accompanied by more or less of head ache & back ache.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101681,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101681","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ff26e8c960d9f556a60d63d961cdab8b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ff26e8c960d9f556a60d63d961cdab8b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ff26e8c960d9f556a60d63d961cdab8b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ff26e8c960d9f556a60d63d961cdab8b.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:57:08+00:00","modified":"2020-08-25T02:30:08+00:00","filename":"ff26e8c960d9f556a60d63d961cdab8b.jpg","authentication":"9ccd6ba8964f7b5353174d166ac7ddb7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_153_006_002_o2.jpg","size":2043108,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2822,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.067036380817387},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["234059"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["234059"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["234059"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ff26e8c960d9f556a60d63d961cdab8b.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920059,"FileSize":2043108,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2822\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2822,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:46:26","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 23:40:59","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 23:40:59","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3100,"ExifImageLength":3954,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"This is decidedly tedious, and vast amounts of cold water internally, or cold wet cloths on the head, chest or hands, afford only an extremely temporary alleviation.\n\nBy and by, the patient begins to sweat, the fever gradually passes off, and he feels simply weak and sleepy, till an other chill come on, usually just twenty four, or just forty eight hours.

The same day was regularly appointed by our Sicker Gov. French, but I guess not one hereabout remembered it.\n\nI breakfasted early, had a horseback ride of three miles or more by about daylights, worked & rode in the woods. {Southern, Illinois thick woods} till dark, then rode to town got supper, worked in office a spell, and then come in to my Landlord's comfortable sitting room, and take the rest of my Thanksgiving in writing a bit to you, interrupted only by the gabbling of a couple Sucker women serving in the same room.  Will that do.    \nI received a good nice letter from you and Eliab last night written Prov. 1 I judge; Mailed Nov. 2.\nYour letters are longer reaching me I suppose for being directed Mount Hawkins. than if direct to Jonesboro. It sometimes takes them a week to get from Mr. Hawkins here.\nAs for your worrying about me: it is much to be lamented if you have not done it to good advantage; I believe I have done all I could towards, have certainly furnished you with the most full and detailed statements of all the facts involved.\nI expect Mother has got back to Bangor by this time, has she not?\nIs Samuel employed at his Mill through the Winter","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101685,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101685","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/69679fc807456fc05fef9255676270bf.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/69679fc807456fc05fef9255676270bf.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/69679fc807456fc05fef9255676270bf.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/69679fc807456fc05fef9255676270bf.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:57:13+00:00","modified":"2020-08-25T03:06:19+00:00","filename":"69679fc807456fc05fef9255676270bf.jpg","authentication":"b55efb23b2012f59867989dd3e5e127b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_153_007_002_o2.jpg","size":1985997,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2886,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.063717467467467},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["234212"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["234212"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["234212"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"69679fc807456fc05fef9255676270bf.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920059,"FileSize":1985997,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2886\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2886,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:46:34","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 23:42:12","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 23:42:12","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"SubSecTimeOriginal":3,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3166,"ExifImageLength":3948,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Samuel, it seems. has not only bought his House lot, but is preparing to build.

(for It is a select school no one can go to it without they know so much and a committee examines them There was two other examined at the same time that I was one passed and the other did not. There is about 30 scholars the Masters name is Worcester. The school is in an large brick building with a steeple between Mr. Pomeroys house and Meeting hose there are 2 other schools in it the common school and a school for young men apprentices Albert Stubb goes to it I have bought a Goulds Latin Grammar for which I gave .92 cents & Mr. Worcester says that I better look over Smiths Arithmetic some what and then study Algebra. I saw and split the wood and have to come down to the stores and market and so on - have to be pretty bust.

Also tell Mayo that I am in Mr. Bash's class in the sabbath-school and that he gave every one of his scholars a little book (Baxters Call) New Years day which was Sunday. I take turns staying from...\n[upside down] my health is pretty good this winter page torn am obliged to hire any washing done the cost from 40 to 90 cents a fortnight and I do the baby's I went down to Charles last week and found I was in the midst of the small pox there was a whole family oposite Miss Metcalfs that had it was near Spring\/ & Popular Streets and it is now in this part of the city. I was not frightened but thought best to vaccinate my babe and now she is cross with it. Isaac has a good deal of time in which he might study but you know it is impossible for a boy to make so much progress alone the time he spends helping me varies according to what I have to do from half an hour to 3 or 4 hours in the course of the day and evening but it is at odd jobs he goes every day when he wishes to study with Ann but sometimes she cannot spare with him so you see that though his advantages are not as good as we had hoped yet they are greater than many have his religious priveleges are really very great but I am afraid he will not improve as he might. I have had him stay two Sabbath evenings for me to go to meeting the rest of the time he would go and every Tuesday evening he goes and occasionally Monday eve. and once a month the young men are to meet at Mr. Boll's for moral, intellectual, and religious improvement and he can join the association. He is in Mr. Bush's class and he is a very devoted pious man but with all these advantages he does not seem to feel more than he has done the importance of the one thing.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101695,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101695","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/65735777eb8e55630b0630352a9da329.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/65735777eb8e55630b0630352a9da329.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/65735777eb8e55630b0630352a9da329.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/65735777eb8e55630b0630352a9da329.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:57:28+00:00","modified":"2020-08-25T19:04:18+00:00","filename":"65735777eb8e55630b0630352a9da329.jpg","authentication":"b6e5867a1a5dd04c74362120f7a04201","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_154_003_002_o2.jpg","size":2008762,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2966,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.062709535226393},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["234417"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["234417"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["234417"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"65735777eb8e55630b0630352a9da329.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920060,"FileSize":2008762,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2966\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2966,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:47:02","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 23:44:17","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 23:44:17","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2937,"ExifImageLength":3564,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"from meeting to tend the babe, (half of every other sabbath).

We have been expecting sometime, but have made out pretty well considering I have been going to write for some time, as I was somewhat in want of my Gloves, old Frock coat etc. but they have come now, nicely as can be.  We are getting along as well as might be expected, I think, this cold weather. I guess that Ann, Notwithstanding her, but, if, a and, has a very good School and moreover is doing grandly in it, and will make a favorably impression. However I am afraid she has most to hard a time of it, with so many Scholars. I am getting along pretty so so in my studies. We have got all over into Cicero a Greek too etc. etc. We, that is this time, we High School boys! have got up a kind of a Club, of 20 or 30, which meet once a week, evenings, in the school room, for Declamation or Debating, improvement I am tuck'd? in for one of the Officers!!! We have met 3 or 4 times Declared a Debated at a great rate. It would be a very good thing, especially for me, if we could sustain it properly a keep order but I suspect it will soon fall to bits, for All boys, especially Bangor boys, except Poet Roberts 2 or 3 others and myself!!! are so flighty and fond play and fun and nothing else that be. I suppose it will be all finish soon. \n I suppose I ought to be very thankful for having such a good place etc. a everything else. I have a excellent place, lamps enough a a warm rooms good chance to study evening a only have to go but a few roads? to School.\n\nWhile Eliab has to go far to School and the cold mornings a thinks no great nice light all the evening to study by. I have or can have a lamp, and place all to myself every evening, to study and write or anything and  Excellent good School, few roads? off and everything Meeting a S. School etc.etc. etc. etc. etc.\nHowever Home is home if it even so homely a I do almost envy the nice tother room by the fire.

June 9. 1839\n\nDear Mother\n\n                Mrs. Parker died last night about 11 oclock. A month ago. she was not expected to live a week, and she has been declining ever since; Mortification began to take place Thursday, the doctor said that nothing but the very irritation of the disease kept her alive so long. She had a very painful sickness and a very hard death from the nature of the disease. She has suffered a great deal of pain, and her features are very much distorted; wasted to a skeleton with her long illness. She has had the same disease a year or two, but was taken very sick the first of June. Notwithstanding the painful nature of the disease, she has had her reason all the time about, her mind wandered a little for a day or two before her death.\n\nMon. P.M. Mrs. Parker's funeral was today, 3 P.M. there was a good many present, Mr. Pomroy of course. She was buried at Mt. Hope 2 1\/2 miles from the city; the whole family, even \"Granmam\" went up; I was left to keep of the house for a long time before, but she thought she must go up to Mt. Hope with them. I think she is smart for so old a lady. Mr. Nath. Harlow or \"Uncle Natty\" has been married again lately! the time I believe. He is not in very good repute with Mr. Walker, I guess. Charles Henry Johnson is apprenticed to him; Mr. W. likes him, so do I.\nHas it not been fair weather at Milo for  3 or 4 weeks? the last real fair day here was the 26th of May I believe.

I would also be convenient if I could have one of the new kind of latin grammars,  but I can get along very well without, I guess. I do not want any more books this term. By the way, if I am going to get a really classical education, it is rather a pity that Ann got such an abridgement of Ainsworth's Lexicon, as so poorly bound etc. as that is, I should near cut 2 or 3 most?, and it is not so good neither, though I can get among with it. I did not know until I saw it that there was such an edition I suppose when Ann enquired for Ainsworth: D. they thought they could get rid of one of those, and she did not know but it was the best one. I rather almost think I had better study french next term, if I go, at least when I get through the Algebra.  Had not I?

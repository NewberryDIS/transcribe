When it came to hand, I thought from the postmark that it was from Sarah, and you may imagine how quickly I tore it open, when to my great disappointment I found that it was from one with whom I was not even acquainted; I did indeed read it through, hoping to find something about our sister. Dear Sarah, she seems still to be improving. I hope she may soon be well. You will probably see Nettie, will you not? They have indeed been deeply afflicted and my heart sympathizes with them. You know that on the morning that you started, the Angel of Death seemed to hover over us about to take a sister from our midst. She still lingered with us all ready and waiting almost impatiently for \"Jesus to come, and take her home,\" until last night about three minutes before twelve when as we trust went home to glory. She as we have reason to believe, entered on an Eternal Sabbath of rest.\n\nand from quarter past eight in the evening till returning. So you see, we can have but six exceptions if we are as bad as we can. Miss Jessup says she is perfectly willing we should have something great for a lunch when we wish if we take what is proper? that is you know what is prepared for the table. So you see we feel as much as if we were at home as possible. We have recess meeting in the reading room and Sunday evening too. Miss Jessup had the meeting last eve. Miss Smith was in two?. I have not been to recess meeting. Friday evening I mistook the bell, and Saturday evening I was in Miss Hops room. We have the tables set in the middle room and it seems cozy enough. We have a small family & dont know exactly the number. Friday I did not work much so on Saturday I made up my missing time and got two hours and a half plus. Today I have not any work to do. I have the care of the towels. Saturday I picked up all the clothes and all the pins that were in the clothes gard and that was the way I got so much unclear. I am going to walk with some of the girls this morning and they are waiting. Good bye my dear.

Mr. Hawks has gone to Springfield today to communicate with them by telegraph and ascertain whether they wish he remains to be brought home or not. You know Miss Scott did not go home last vacation and was designing to go Friday morning with her sister and of course anticipated a very happy time. About half an hour before she was going to start, Miss Hops expressed a wish that Miss Scott might be with her all the time, so Miss Scott relinquished the pleasure of going home and with Gertrude most of the time until she died. She could not be easy unless Miss S. was by her side night and day. Miss Stout has not yet left, perhaps she will go tomorrow though I do not know. She said Friday morn. that she was not going till Sat. or Mon. morn. and that is all I know about it. I am a little impatient to get your letter, at least I will be it it does not come. Tuesday night. O, Jennie, you dont know what a nice time we are having. We can rest just well for ought I can see as if we were at home. I took her breakfast to her yesterday and this morning. Miss Jessup has the care of us, and the girls all say why how good Miss Jessup is. Friday evening at supper table, after the rest had gone, she talked to us a little and said that she hoped we would have a happy vacation and a profitable one. She thought we ought to rest a great deal take a good deal of time to sleep &c and for the general good we would have a few regulations, and they would ask us every morning at table a few questions. The items are these \"Tardy in returning.\" She hoped more would retire late, we might us sleep as long as we wished in the morning if we were only present in season at the breakfast table, which is at 7 o'clock. \"Tardy at, and absent from table'\" \"Tardy at & absent from domestic work.\" This was very important in order to have every thing done pleasantly and nicely.

1850's \/annotation\nWednesday afternoon\nMy dearest Janey\nWhat shall I write to cheer the heart of my poor homesick sister? My heart is sad for thee, my sister, I fain would be with thee. I long to press my lips to thine, Once more thy face to see. Dear Janey you dont know how much I want to see you. I wish I was there with you to help you carry ashes up and down those many flights of stairs. We are afraid very much that you will hurt your back carrying them so much up and down stairs. You look to be stronger than you really are and I fear that if you do not tell them that they will unintentionally assign to you heavier labor than you are able to perform. You must take care Janey not to hurt yourself. How long are you to hold that important office? not long I hope. I recieved your letter last Wednesday night. I think was very glad to have a letter from you but was very, very sorry that you felt so lonely and discouraged. I expect you will like it better when you get into the regular classes and the examination is over. Write often and tell me how you get along. We all feel very anxious to hear from you after but not more anxious I suppose you will say, than you are to hear from us. We did not at all realize that you were gone so far until we had your letters. It seemed as though you would were gone away for a short time and  would be home in a few days.

They will have his cradle finished in a few days.

She sent but one thinking Mr. Butter might supply the rest - I had two letters from Robert last week. He seems to be doing well with his business.

I am much pleased with the inscriptions as now arranged. Had thought myself of the form that Lewis suggested and did not know which was best. In your copying you have omitted the date of Father's birth - Jan 2, 1791 but I have no doubt it was only your mistake in copying & that they will not leave it out. Another mistake you have is in Robert's & Henry's births. You have them just reversed. \nDear Anna; I bought a lace bonnet for Frankie to send home with Hattie at cost $.1.25 you can get that amt from Sarah and keep it for your own self and the other 25 cts can be returned to Jane Ester. I hope she will like it. I had not much time to look around that was the prettiest I saw. Good bye all all of you. I treated myself  today to a scarlet verbena & a lobelia as they call it.

I went out with cousin Annie this morning\nremain here for the winter & make my living if it seemed best for me to do so, but do not yet feel like settling down to practice and think now is the best time to look over the things at home if it would not make you sick? I am feeling very well now and sleeping better and my digestion does not trouble me. The postman comes with a letter for me I hope. Much love dear ones.

We had a hard frost last night, making the ground white. There has been more wintry weather since I have been here, than they have had all winter, and indeed more than we had in Osawatomie but spring will soon come & with it the beautiful spring flowers. How Lewis & Olive will enjoy the rambles after the flowers this spring! This cold weather will keep the fruit buds back & secure more fruit we hope. They have a number of apricot & peach trees in the yard. I have learned how to fasten basque & skirt together. Make short small loops & fasten them to the seams on each side of the back seam & under the arm by belt & put buttons to correspond on band of skirt.

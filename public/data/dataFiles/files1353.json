The letter lay some time in the hands of the Judge and a number of the opposition party saw it and put in circulation stories to the effect stated to you by the friendly Chiefs. \nI hope you will take no exception on account of their writing, as they did it in the simplicity of their hearts. You have long been acquainted with Indians and know something of their late contest, and the tenacity of there opinions. It has been the case for six months past that both parties have been writing to the President, Bishop and Governour \u2014 Wherefore, I hope you will not suppose it as a want of respect, especially as the party who lately wrote have stated to me, since the receipt of your Letter, the regret for the misunderstanding, and the highest respect, regard, and veneration for you. \nI am sorry to say that I fear too many people stand ready to write and serve the Indians and fear, when serving them that they often put words in their mouths \u2014 whether, they are friendly or not to the Indians, I cannot say. But permit me to remark that I am assured, and \n\n\nAyer N.A. ms. 999","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114207,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114207","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3d4a75429bf3d9135175173c5915c9b0.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3d4a75429bf3d9135175173c5915c9b0.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3d4a75429bf3d9135175173c5915c9b0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3d4a75429bf3d9135175173c5915c9b0.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-20T22:04:30+00:00","modified":"2020-12-03T19:57:54+00:00","filename":"3d4a75429bf3d9135175173c5915c9b0.jpg","authentication":"78081734d233b0715ccf9e1f9d823923","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_999_BX01_FL002_00002_o2.jpg","size":579402,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1832,"resolution_y":2991,"compression_ratio":0.035246569402531},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120517"],"TimeCreated":["082359"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120517"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120517"],"TimeCreated":["082359"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120517"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120517"],"TimeCreated":["082359"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120517"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3d4a75429bf3d9135175173c5915c9b0.jpg","FileDateTime":1605909853,"FileSize":579402,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1832\" height=\"2991\"","Height":2991,"Width":1832,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2991,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop 21.2 (Windows)","DateTime":"2020:11:19 16:32:39","Exif_IFD_Pointer":284},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3075},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:17 08:23:59","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:17 08:23:59","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":61,"SubSecTimeDigitized":61,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1832,"ExifImageLength":2991,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1353,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1353","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"have often stated to them, you Honoured Sir, the best friend to Indians in the state. \n\nI write this with the knowledge or rather at the desire of the chiefs.\n\nWith sentiments of deepest respect,\nI am Honoured sir, your Most \nobedient and very humble\nservant \u2013 Eleazer Williams\nHis Hon.

Imagine the Deity to reside in the image, their worship has terminated on the image itself. At first perhaps they have aged images to excite their devotion, & by an easy transition have gone on to worship the image together with God & finally to pay divine worship to the senseless image alone supposing it to be divine or inspired with the divinity.\n\n Thus men might originally worship the true God, under the Idea, that some image of him was proper to excite their devotion, & finally forgetting its original institution, terminated their worship on the image itself.  How stupid & impious is that devotion, the work of Men's hands, instead of the only true God. Thus pagans & papists worship images. The greeks & romans worshiped or professed to worship the Supreme being under the name of Jupiter to whom temples were erected & his images placed in them. They worshiped also a multitude of other false gods, whom they supposed inferior & subordinate to the true God, & prayed to them as Mediators or governors appointed to preside over various parts of the Universe & the affairs, employments & business of men. We have a specimen of this idolatrous worship of the pagan World, in the divine honors & high esteem, that the people of Ephesus paid to the imaginary goddess Diana.

The reason of this prohibition is that God cannot be represented by any image, symbol or likeness of any thing wither among the works of nature or art.  He is a spiritual existance & all images are corporeal. They fall infinitely short of any Idea of him. They tend to divess the mind of those conceptions which we ought ever to form of God, as a being uncompounded, indivisible & omnipresent. They are therefore most unworthy of being held forth to the view of the mind as in any measure adequate to God & therefore are impious attempts to bring down the deity to a level with his creatures. God is a spirit infinite & eternal, and images & likenesses are material, corporeal & finite. This preference is every where, but an image is confined to one place, & therefore cannot represent him. No material image can represent a spiritual object, any more than the eye can discern sounds, or the ear colors. Our Lord hath taught us that as God is a spirit, he cannot be worshiped by any resemblances, but must be worshiped in spirit & in truth.\n2. No doubt another reason prohibiting the  worship of God by images, is the danger of the mind, payg divine honors to the image, instead of him, whom the image is formed to represent or express.

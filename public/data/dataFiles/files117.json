Everett, Overbrook, Ks.\nMy dear Cousin, --\nThere appears to be a little controversy over the ownership of a part share (4\/10) in the old W. W. Mills Dry Goods Co., Topeka.

If you don't have room, don't bother about it. We'll find something here. You might wear your winter hat up here and then get a new spring one when you get here. We have a dandy little millinery shop and they have some good-looking new spring hats. They are very reasonable too. You ought to have a light-weight coat too. One of the stores here has some good ready-to-wear garments and their coats are very good-looking.\nAren't we having fine warm weather?

We didn't come out first in everything. We were second in the Track and Field meet but were first in the Literary Contest. In the literary contest we made first in a mixed chorus and second in an orchestra number. (Mr. Marks has been bragging on that orchestra for six-weeks and they've practiced only about four pieces all year and they got to play two of those pieces last night. Of course I wasn't glad they took just second place but since I didn't take first in everything I couldn't repress a feeling of wicked joy.) My work took first in ovation (three rousing cheers!) second in declamation and second in essay. At that we made 11 points out of 19. I really didn't think we would win first place in declamation but the thing I objected to was having Seneca win first place because their contestant was punk. Centralia should have had first and us second. But I don't feel badly although I wish we could have taken two first places and one second. The thing that worries me is I'm afraid I don't know enough about such things to train any one. I've never had a real expression lesson in my life but I know how I","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":28556,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/28556","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/cbe66302e3c683e5bf8d5fb628126494.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/cbe66302e3c683e5bf8d5fb628126494.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/cbe66302e3c683e5bf8d5fb628126494.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cbe66302e3c683e5bf8d5fb628126494.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-07T15:34:07+00:00","modified":"2020-01-17T22:45:00+00:00","filename":"cbe66302e3c683e5bf8d5fb628126494.jpg","authentication":"dadd06fec94dd519e6f2bb3958fdbccf","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_13_fl_473_002_02_o2.jpg","size":1652613,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2790,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.054845778574273},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["031613"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["031613"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["031613"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cbe66302e3c683e5bf8d5fb628126494.jpg","FileDateTime":1507390374,"FileSize":1652613,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2790\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2790,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:02 12:42:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:07:28 03:16:13","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:07:28 03:16:13","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":75,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3084,"ExifImageLength":3978,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":117,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/117","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"like to hear a reading and how I don't like it\nWe didn't go over to Seneca until about four.

We didn't get in bed until 12:30 & as a result I'm rather sleepy this morning. I'm getting too old to dissipate, I guess.\nI've been suffering more or less from headaches again since Friday.

I never can tell.\nI went out to Clifford's sister's for dinner Sunday. About the whole family was there. Had a good time. We played New Orleans, Hide and Seek, etc. You see there are a number of little folks there and we had to accommodate them also. I've been so stiff every since, after such unwonted exertion, that I do well to get around at all. \nA week from Fri. we're invited out in the country to stay until Sunday morning. I expect we'll go fishing, etc. This Fri. is the Jr. - Sr. Reception. I shudder when I think of the similar event last year.

I wish we could have it today and have it over. My two gave their selections in Chapel yesterday & did quite well. But there is so much room for improvement. The boy giving the oration understands corrections so well and remembers every one. Even though he has his oration well learned he seems to be able to change his original method of giving it upon being corrected. The girl giving the reading can't seem to change so easily. She says things almost the same way now, after repeated corrections, as she did when she first learned it. But she tries hard & she certainly is brave. Her mother died just about two weeks ago and she is going ahead with this because her mother wanted her to. I hadn't heard the essay for about ten days but then I was disgusted with it. On hearing it again yesterday it sounded quite respectable and I have hopes of placing in it. \n\n I wish I would hear from Red Wing. I certainly would like to go there. I'd write again if I thought it would do any good.\n In about six weeks or 6 1\/2 now I'll be giving myself the great pleasure of being at home. I had thought at first to express myself at as Stryver, being a fellow of great delicacy but since I believe the role of Carton to be more winning I express my sentiments as a fellow of no delicacy - (Influence of \"Tale of Two Cities.\") Anyway, I'll certainly be glad to be home.\n The day reminds me of Longfellow's \"The Rainy Day.\" His line \"It rains and the wind is never weary\" - just fits today - In fact the wind hasn't been particularly weary for several days now.\n We are studying our magazines now. They certainly are interesting. I believe that even some of the youngsters like them.\n\nIsn't the tuition at Carleton rather high? Mary might as well go to Minneapolis. I'm sorry there's no chance for me at Northfield. But my destiny is awaiting me some place else, I'm certain.\n\n You write to me with so much regularity that I am made ashamed of myself. Perhaps some day I'll improve. I do hope mother is feeling all right again.

It was rather a thrill to be again waiting for the arrival of one of the Everetts at the station: I knew her readily enough, although I did almost carry off another girl at first, by mistake. As soon as I can arrange it I shall see her in Schenectady, and see if she has made as desirable living arrangements as are possible. I admire her spunk in packing up and coming as she did and am sure she will make good quickly.\n We discussed various things, aside from our delight in seeing each other (Helen and Margaret seemed to approve of one another and did more discussing, by volume, than I took part in) and among them the educational and other outlook for the family at the moment. At the risk of intruding I am going to \"make a few remarks\" which may or may not be appropos but which are surely meant well.\n I deduced from Margaret's comments and remarks that she is relied upon, or has offered, to help Mary financially this spring. I do not believe she should, but that she definitely should be enjoined from it. She is in a slightly different environment now, and must if she is to profit by it, get ahead financially if only by a tiny margin. I firmly believe she will require all that she can earn for the next twelve months to equip her properly with clothes, \"appurtenances\" and the outer panoply of inner confidence which she will inevitably require to profit by the opportunities which can be expected to appear in Schenectady or elsewhere in the east. Her health being what it is, she requires some little smoothnesses in the way of life which she only can get by having the full use of her earnings. For emergencies' and mental-ease's sake she should gradually acquire a reserve fund of at least a few dollars also.\n As I understand the situation, Edward will be able to assume his own destiny's control (if fortune is normally good) after this school year is passed and a summer's rest. Although Margerat said nothing on this point I have somehow received the impression that for you to carry Mary through the balance of her college course will mean a lessening of the insurance and other reserves which you and mother possess or may come to have.\n I am not able to take over Mary's college expenses as I should like to. If unmarried I could do it in full, and would have volunteered to some time since. I hope to help Margaret some now: not in a direct financial way, but in helping her to opportunities for self-advancement (materially speaking) and to certain occasional relaxations, which represent financial outlay indirectly. I want to help Edward to chances to get on his feet in a material way, also, if I can. But I feel very strongly that the essential for the family is now for Margaret first, then Edward, to get on their feet financially. We have been \"poor\" too long - in the sense that we have worked without the proper tools, the proper material footing to do ourselves justice. If Margaret can be left alone for a year I believe she will establish a new sort of independence that will be worth far more than a certain number of dollars to her: Edward can do the same in a short time after graduation if he can find himself in reasonably favorable surroundings.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":28572,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/28572","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/931c757934949de5fabad01ea33c3467.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/931c757934949de5fabad01ea33c3467.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/931c757934949de5fabad01ea33c3467.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/931c757934949de5fabad01ea33c3467.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-07T15:34:22+00:00","modified":"2020-08-22T18:56:19+00:00","filename":"931c757934949de5fabad01ea33c3467.jpg","authentication":"3ed99576415bcfe5c5d05cd1a1cb7abf","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_13_fl_474_002_02_o2.jpg","size":1415660,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2835,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046236200927559},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["031848"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["031848"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["031848"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"931c757934949de5fabad01ea33c3467.jpg","FileDateTime":1507390375,"FileSize":1415660,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2835\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2835,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:02 12:21:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:07:28 03:18:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:07:28 03:18:48","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3086,"ExifImageLength":3918,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":117,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/117","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"All this, it would seem, cold-bloodedly disregards the youngest of the brood, Mary.

It is a great comfort to me that she can spend nearly every week end at home coming Friday night and returning Sunday night on the train.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":28597,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/28597","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8ccdb0d04fd31f59d19baf9bac78be48.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8ccdb0d04fd31f59d19baf9bac78be48.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8ccdb0d04fd31f59d19baf9bac78be48.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8ccdb0d04fd31f59d19baf9bac78be48.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-07T15:34:46+00:00","modified":"2020-08-21T14:11:35+00:00","filename":"8ccdb0d04fd31f59d19baf9bac78be48.jpg","authentication":"19cdc414e8a24c116ecc1ffa369c97e9","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_13_fl_477_001_04_o2.jpg","size":1131144,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2276,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046017379418082},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["032325"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["032325"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["032325"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8ccdb0d04fd31f59d19baf9bac78be48.jpg","FileDateTime":1507390375,"FileSize":1131144,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2276\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2276,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:02 12:22:13","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:07:28 03:23:25","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:07:28 03:23:25","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":8,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1836,"ExifImageLength":2903,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":117,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/117","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I had a letter from Holden at Christmas time and he wrote very encouraging news of Elizabeth She is still in the hospital but they hope she can soon go to her home in Knoxville Tenn.

Do you long for eastern life or shall you settle near your father? Aunt Jennie wrote me of your coming as far as Chicago; did you see the Michigan friends? I wish I could see you and talk with you about my life here. In some respects I am very happy. We have a nice large room on 4th floor - two windows - plenty of air and light. From Miss Perrin's letter to me I supposed there would be a fair degree of elegance but the room is quite shabbily furnished - old carpet \"centuries old\" and hopelessly dusty; the furnace heat does not reach us and so we must have a dirty little stove in our room. However we are warm, well fed and comfortable; we can do without elegance. It is the principle of the thing I am contending for. Your letter giving me an estimate of the members of the household gave me a fresh lease of life, for I was frightened to death (?) and as I have read the open books myself these two months of New York life. I find myself often complimenting you upon your insight into character. I say \"Yea and amen\" to every verdict you gave. Miss M. is intolerable to me socially speaking. I think her manners are the worst I ever saw. We do not quarrel however, I have too much tact for that. Miss A. is kind not over-thoughful but well-intentioned. She is burdened with care which I would gladly lighten if I could. Superficial in her knowledge + too worldly for a first-class teacher. Mrs. Perrin is ill and keeps her room for weeks at a time. Howell I admire exceedingly. How such a common-sense boy could develop in this atmosphere I am curious to discover.\nMy business relations are entirely with Miss A. and so far as I know they are satisfactory. There are but two boarders and five day scholars in the advanced department - and only three or four children in the primary. I do not see how they can afford to continue the school.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":28642,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/28642","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/45522124a213d8624968377a8f801e6c.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/45522124a213d8624968377a8f801e6c.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/45522124a213d8624968377a8f801e6c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/45522124a213d8624968377a8f801e6c.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-07T15:35:29+00:00","modified":"2020-05-17T16:12:19+00:00","filename":"45522124a213d8624968377a8f801e6c.jpg","authentication":"06f8de28af37510ef441e1c785f0399c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_13_fl_478_014_03_o2.jpg","size":1099996,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2306,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044168031865343},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042317"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042317"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042317"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"45522124a213d8624968377a8f801e6c.jpg","FileDateTime":1507390377,"FileSize":1099996,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2306\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2306,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:02 12:23:51","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:07:28 04:23:17","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:07:28 04:23:17","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":31,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1845,"ExifImageLength":2880,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":117,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/117","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Before I proceed to talk let me say that I am truly sorry that you are leaving the ministry.

Putnam\nMinister\nLudington, Mich.,\nJune 29, 1920.\nMy Dear Cousin Eddie:\nFor over a week I have been trying to find time and strength to write you. Perhaps I ought not to speak of the reason for delay in this manner when the real reason has been my own state of mind. It has been very hard to bring myself to do the things that were for me to do even though they were very important. Hattie entered life immortal one week ago last Sunday afternoon at five o'clock and the consequent sorrow in my own heart has stood in the way of all my normal life. I have neglected my best friends. I know I ought to have better control of myself, but it is taking time for me to get the mastery.\nWe brought her home the first week in June reaching home the 3rd. It was quite an undertaking to make the journey, but we were prospered on the trip and the precious wife was greatly cheered to be in her own home again and surrounded by her old friends. For a few days the change seemed to help her, but it was only temporary. Reaction set in and it soon became evident that she could last only a very short time. Elizabeth and her family came home and their coming also helped for a few days, but nothing in this world could hold that sweet spirit in the body. She realized that she could remain only a short time and after the situation appeared to her in the true light she wanted to go as soon as possible. She was unconscious the most of the time for several days. The final passing was quiet and without a struggle.\nI think that outside of the immediately family you knew her better than any of our other relatives. I shall never forget your association with us in our temporary home in New York. You know how brave and sweet and true her spirit was though her body was so frail. She accomplished a wonderful amount of work with very little physical strength. I do not know how I can get along without her. After a man lives in this world as long as I have he ought to be able to stand alone, but some way I feel my dependence upon that dear woman more and more as I try to face the duties and problems of life. I am thankful to have the dear daughter and her children who are with me at least for the summer. They are a great help. If Malcolm can in any way arrange his business so as to move back to Ludington, they will all be here permanently.\nWith love.\nHolden\nBurial was here in Ludington last Wednesday.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":28659,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/28659","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d9eb20fbdf4cf93d2f923947dda8b33b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d9eb20fbdf4cf93d2f923947dda8b33b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d9eb20fbdf4cf93d2f923947dda8b33b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d9eb20fbdf4cf93d2f923947dda8b33b.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-07T15:35:46+00:00","modified":"2020-01-17T22:45:00+00:00","filename":"d9eb20fbdf4cf93d2f923947dda8b33b.jpg","authentication":"27182f5cda12c1c0c6347329f529856b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_13_fl_478_020_01_o2.jpg","size":1219138,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2878,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.039222775590045},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042518"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042518"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042518"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d9eb20fbdf4cf93d2f923947dda8b33b.jpg","FileDateTime":1507390377,"FileSize":1219138,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2878\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2878,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:02 12:24:27","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:07:28 04:25:18","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:07:28 04:25:18","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1890,"ExifImageLength":2364,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":117,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/117","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"New York Mills\nAug. 3 - 21\nMy dear cousin\nYour letter so full of news of old friends, as well as your own family, followed me to my old home, which now belongs to Will Thomas and his family, where I came in early June for a few weeks visit, not having been here in four years, and was glad to come once more to see the friends here and in Utica.

I expect to remain for the rest of the month. Louisa has gone to Brooklyn for her summer vacation. and for company to Josie while Katherine with her nine months old daughter go to her Fathers summer home near Asbury Park for their vacation.

Williams family of so long ago.

I do not remember anything that happened between February and May, tho I suppose I must have been at the same old routine of studying the language and teaching English. In May I finished my second year of Chinese except for the history, which was in English, and which I had been dreading ever since I arrived in China. You know I do not like history. So I made up my mind that should be my summer's work. May was quite memorable because for the first time in my life I was a bridesmaid. The wedding was that of two our American Board missionaries in Peking, Mr. Cross and Miss Tenney, and we had a great time, with several people up from Techow and even one out from Shansi. Before and after the wedding, of course, there were a number of other good times when the group of young people who have been together a great deal tried to see as much of each other as possible before a number of them went home to America.\n With June came the closing of schools. The boarding school closed about thirteen days early because of scarlet fever and measles, both of which broke out on the same day. We isolated the cases and hoped to continue, but the rest of the girls kept imagining themselves sick and kept the doctor on his way here most of the time until we had no peace and decided that we might as well give up for good. When school was out and the girls had gone home it was about time to go to Wo Fo Ssu to the Y.W.C.A. summer conference and I enjoyed it very much. There was a much larger number of foreigners present than the year before and more Chines girls, in spite of the fact that people had that on account of the student uprising there would be a small attendance. I was recreation chairman. This is my second Y.W.C.A. summer conference. There was not a great deal made of patriotism as a them, but we all felt that the girls had been affected by the student movement. They are more independent and ready to push ahead. I noticed it particularly in the matter of recreation. The year before we had to keep making them do things, and this year they wanted to do things themselves and even went ahead of our plans for them. Miss T'ao, who is studying in the Y.W.C.A. physical training school in Shanghai, had charge of calisthenics and I had charge of taking them on trips, arranging Stunt Day and such things. We had some very good times. On Stunt Day the foreign leaders acted out a Chinese primary school with Mrs. Jewell of the Methodist Mission as teacher, and what roars of laughter when we foreigners appeared in Chinese clothes with out hair in pigtails!\n\nAfter the conference I went straight to Peitaiho, where I spent six weeks, being housekeeper for the family. Through July there was a small family, only about six most of the time, at Gould Cottage, but the servants were hard to manage, so it was not an easy job. Every day I buckled down to Chinese history and at the end of July had the satisfaction of finishing it, with about ten days or two weeks left of vacation. Then I had sick headaches all that time and didn't have any fun. I had planned to have a number of trips, but did not get outside of Peitaiho. Mable was there for three of the weeks I was, so we managed to get a good visit. The beginning of August there was  a three days meeting of the Chihli-Shanzi Christian Educational Association, which happened to strike town just as the hottest wave that Peitaiho has known for several years arrived. as the educators, great and","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":28670,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/28670","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/6c2c51ecacac39a3cafcdfbc1e005380.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/6c2c51ecacac39a3cafcdfbc1e005380.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/6c2c51ecacac39a3cafcdfbc1e005380.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6c2c51ecacac39a3cafcdfbc1e005380.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-07T15:35:56+00:00","modified":"2020-08-21T18:53:49+00:00","filename":"6c2c51ecacac39a3cafcdfbc1e005380.jpg","authentication":"6b3b621b2b8ee7850dfd7c3a2de7d6dd","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_13_fl_479_002_02_o2.jpg","size":1266958,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2317,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050630524784603},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042700"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042700"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042700"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6c2c51ecacac39a3cafcdfbc1e005380.jpg","FileDateTime":1507390378,"FileSize":1266958,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2317\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2317,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:02 12:24:55","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:07:28 04:27:00","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:07:28 04:27:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3001,"ExifImageLength":4662,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":117,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/117","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"-2-\nwould-be-great, sweltered as they discussed what they were going to do with Chinese education. As soon as that was over I came back to Tungshien. We had here a teachers' conference (institute) for twenty days, with about 150 Chinese teachers in attendance. This is the second year it has been held here, and everyone seems to think that this year was an improvement over previous years in a number of respects. The teachers who taught in the Institute were for the most part English, and it was my job to keep house for them. You know about how much I know about English people, anyway. I cannot remember having had a speaking acquaintance with one until I came out here, and it was some job to try and make them happy in that awful August weather. But they were all very delightful people and I continue to be glad I had the opportunity to get acquainted at such close range. I went to some of the meetings, but most of what I learned I learned outside in hearing the tachers talk. My time was very full getting ready for school to start, which it was to do as soon as the Institute was over, and altho I had been here a year in connection with this school I still knew very little about educational problems and I knew few Chinese equivalents for educational terms.\n\n The first of September we opened the girls' boarding school. Of the four teachers three are new, one of them a teacher who has taught in one of our primary schools for some 20 years and has just been promoted to the position in the boarding school. The two other teachers are newly graduated, one from academy and one form the college normal department. I had rather supposed that we would not have any larger enrollment than last year because we have done no advertising, and I was not particularly anxious to have a large increase at the time of a change in management; but instead of 66 we have 77 with prospects of some others coming the second term. One interesting things about the school this year is that we have a graduating class of 17; six is the largest they have ever had before. I think in many ways this simplifies the management of the school this year, because I know these older girls best, having had them in English classes, and when I get them with me in a matter the younger girls do not dare have a different opinion. I was somewhat disappointed last year, but not particularly surprised, to find that this school stood lowest of the 18 grade school which took the uniform examinations given by the Association, but we are hoping to do much better this year. So I have a great deal of encouragement, the many times it seems a hopeless task making them remember to do the things which they are supposed to do and not to do the things they are supposed not to do.\n\nLast year we had six primary schools. This year before the year is over we will have nine. They were supposed to begin the first of September and five began then, but for various very good reasons the others have opened one by one. The new school at the Drum Tower Church, which had been the center of our fond hopes, could not begin because the building has not been finished. Also, the house for the teacher had no sooner been finished than an extra heavy rain melted the building into mud. It had been made of cheap mud bricks and not sufficiently protected until it was dry. It was a great disappointment, but now it is rebuilt and a school house and kindergarten are finished, the yard all smoothed, and we are having school. The school is not as big as it ought to be, and it is great fun to hear the teacher tell what all those children can think of to do and what funny writing they make; but the poor lit-","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":28671,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/28671","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b877ec944bd7480f3f33f29d33a1a47d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b877ec944bd7480f3f33f29d33a1a47d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b877ec944bd7480f3f33f29d33a1a47d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b877ec944bd7480f3f33f29d33a1a47d.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-07T15:35:57+00:00","modified":"2020-08-21T18:56:48+00:00","filename":"b877ec944bd7480f3f33f29d33a1a47d.jpg","authentication":"40bdaa491f6eda46e24de600bc21d7f9","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_13_fl_479_002_03_o2.jpg","size":1182036,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2271,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048193649395763},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042708"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042708"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042708"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b877ec944bd7480f3f33f29d33a1a47d.jpg","FileDateTime":1507390378,"FileSize":1182036,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2271\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2271,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:02 12:24:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:07:28 04:27:08","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:07:28 04:27:08","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2978,"ExifImageLength":4719,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":117,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/117","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"-3-\n-tle things never had a chance to go to school before and they haven't had much teaching at home, so we mustn't expect too much of them.\n\n  Tung Pa opened about two weeks late and is my prize school because, for all it is new and in a very small town, they now have 32 pupils, all girls, and a very enthusiastic teacher who is making a great hit. The teacher was in last week and was telling me about what a time she had teaching the children. She said that when she bad them make Arabic numerals, they objected because they were \"foreign\", and they did not believe her when she told them their science lessons. They are almost entirely outside the church, most of them from families who have had almost no touch with the Church, so they do not see why they should not have school every day of the week. She does not dare not let them come on Sunday and so when they come she has Sunday-school and at church time she says, \"Now I am going to church. You may just sit here and study your Bible lesson and be very, very quiet. That is, unless you want to go with me. Anybody who wants to may go with me to church.\" And so far everyone has elected church.\n  Of the other two schools which I hope to have, one would have begun the first of September except that cholera has been especially bad in that place and they have not opened yet. I hope they can begin within a week or so. The other is a place where we had not planned to have s school, but since school began they have become enthusiastic over having a school and I told them that we would help hem with $80 if they did the rest.- just as we had in the case of other places where we have opened new schools. I didn't really expect them to do anything, and I am not sure that money is going to be very plentiful, but when they got so enthusiastic and did their part I had to keep my promise, and a week or so will find a new school started there. I hope that it won't be more than two or three years until all these country places where we have churches will have schools as well, and it certainly looks as tho it wouldn't be any more than that before we could accomplish it.\n  All the American missionaries have been busy these days working on the Interchurch survey. My part in it was not very large compared to that of the people who planned a work over larger territory, but it means that I should plan definitely what I hoped to do in the boarding school for the next 5 years, and not only in the boarding school but in the matter of primary schools; they really are not separate, because if we have more lower primary schools it means more pupils for the higher primary, but if we have more schools in the country that means that more girls can study at home, and less come to boarding school. I am glad that these plans had to be made now because I might not have been so prompt if I hadn't been having the pressure of some outside force, and certainly the boarding school, at least, has come to the place where it is ready for expansion. The way it has grown this year without any effort to get more pupils is a little indication of what is likely to happen when we try to get more. It means that within a year's time we must have some more buildings or limit the number of pupils to less than would naturally come. I have pretty clearly in mind what I hope to do.\n  Next year we need a building for the third and fourth grades which will leave our present recitation rooms free for the use of the higher primary, that is the 5th, 6th and 7th grades. Then we must have some more dormitories and I hope not only for dormitories to use several rooms for laundry and bathing purposes which are at present squeezed into very small space.

Maybe some of the other secretaries would like to come, too, since it is such a fine day.\n\n  We will go down by the moat on the way into the city. This old gentleman we are meeting is my teacher. He has the proverbial classical teacher's air and walk; I suppose it must look strange to him to see us swinging along so fast. His greeting of, \"Where are you going?\" is partly curiosity, I shall have to confess, altho it is a polite greeting. And please do not think I am rude when I say, \"Into the city,\" altho he can plainly see that that is where we are bound. Chinese etiquette does not require that we tell him the exact place.\n  We go past the church and over to just inside the South Gate, and there we will find some rickshaws. In good Chinese fashion, we dicker for the price and jew him down one penny, because we do not want to change the custom, and they all know that we always pay ten coppers to Mrs. Wang's. As we go along, on both sides of the road are the places where the soldiers drill, and they are all drilling, too. There is a bunch doing the goose step, just as Germans would do.\n  Now, this place where they have the fair is one the rickshaw men always seem to like to go thru, even tho it is a much slower way, because we have to stop for the crowds so. I always want to buy something, but there isn't anything that we could use very well. I wonder what that funny music is about. - I never heard anything so wierd or elaborate. I suppose when we reach the crowd we will find out. Oh, the rickshaw man says it is a funeral. It certainly is elegant, and I wish we could see the costumes a little better. There seem to be a large number of priests.\n  Now we are past the main street and can move faster, altho these hutungs are very much in need of repair. This reminds me of one time in Peking when we were walking along and remarked, \"What nice wide hutungs!\" and then suddenly laughed to think how we would have looked at them a year ago when we were fresh from America and its wide streets. The last time I came over to Mrs. Wang's was in one of the biggest snow storms we had last winter, when she invited Miss Smith and me over to east cho-po-pos. Then there was a goat tied in the corner of the room next hers, and the rest of the room and another were filled with fodder and fuel.\n  But, here we are, and Mrs. Wang is greeting us. A number of people are already here. I do not remember their names, but they are all women that I have met before. This is Ch'ien Lao Tai Tai that you may have heard about. She is certainly an enthusiastic church member. I suppose she has brought that brilliant great-grandson of hers over to the kindergarten. Sure enough, there he is, sitting in one of the little chairs, waiting for the show to begin. Mrs. Wang says he has been there day after day since the rooms have been fixed up, always sitting in the little chairs. I wonder what thoughts are running through his little head as he looks forward to this wonderful kindergarten.\n  We will put up these bright-colored pictures that I have brought. This room with its clean, white walls and its little tables and chairs is truly a transformation from those two small room full of fodder. We might look around a bit while we are waiting for more people to come. That structure they are putting up in the yard is a mat awning. They say that the other family in this court is to marry the son soon. Look at that funny chicken tied to an old shoe by a string; that is a good way to safeguard it from running away.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":28674,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/28674","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4b9b2d12df0ec64e335e42d340ea33fb.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4b9b2d12df0ec64e335e42d340ea33fb.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4b9b2d12df0ec64e335e42d340ea33fb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4b9b2d12df0ec64e335e42d340ea33fb.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-07T15:36:00+00:00","modified":"2020-08-21T19:01:04+00:00","filename":"4b9b2d12df0ec64e335e42d340ea33fb.jpg","authentication":"d8ca5cc195781b41fd85d335c3a2b718","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_13_fl_479_003_02_o2.jpg","size":1294863,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2859,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041935894446388},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042738"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042738"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042738"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4b9b2d12df0ec64e335e42d340ea33fb.jpg","FileDateTime":1507390378,"FileSize":1294863,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2859\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2859,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:02 12:25:06","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:07:28 04:27:38","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:07:28 04:27:38","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3246,"ExifImageLength":4087,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":117,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/117","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"--2\nAnd just see that spoiled little youngster, all dressed in red, eating out of that tiny little wooden dish about as big as a pickle, and his big sister tagging around after him, letting him do whatever he wants to, in true Chinese fashion.\n\n  Oh, here comes the teacher, and she has brought with her her little four year old niece. My, what a bright, pretty child! all the women remark about her and ask who she is; and when they find that she is the niece of the \"lao shih\" they say, \"How beautiful! How bright! Not to be wondered at.\" Here come three or four more women, bringing two children, a brother and sister. Doesn't that one just want to make you call here, \"The Old Dowager\", with her can and her airs? Isn't it nice, the way all the other women give her the precedence?\n  What's the excitement? Oh, it must be that the hsien official's grandson has arrived. Here he comes, borne aloft by a big man servant. And there is his amah behind, carrying a thermos bottle. He is not such a wonderful looking little lad to have all this fuss, in spite of his good clothes and his cap with its big red ball on top. You know they say that one reason why they send him to kindergarten is in order to get him weaned. He is certainly old enough - four years old.\n  Now the teacher is going to write down their names. Some of them have names, but some still have their baby names and want the teacher to give them student names. This little girl's mother says she must ask her mother-in-law and tell the teacher to-morrow, if the name is all right. She cannot even name her own daughter.\n\nNow at last the kindergarten is really opened and the children are playing with the peg-board. but their mothers and grandmothers cannot let them along; it is quite a race to see which one can help her small relative get through first. I am afraid they are disappointed because they cannot see anything remarkable in the amount of progress that their youngsters have made today, but at least they have something to come back for to-morrow. It is strange that there are only eight children here to-day besides the teacher's little niece. They said they were going to have twenty. But it seems that to-morrow is a lucky day, and I suppose some of them are waiting until then to start. Anyway, I will trust Mrs. Wang to hunt up the children and Miss Chu to keep them after they come. She has eighteen in her other kindergarten now, and there is no reason why this one should not be just as big, if not bigger.\n\n  Miss Chu is giving the signal for the kindergartners to make their bow to her, and I suppose it is time to go. I do hope you are not sorry to have spent so much time.\n\nAlice Margaret Huggins","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":28675,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/28675","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3d55c3a2ad5b0f9f6f51f7b30c97a540.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3d55c3a2ad5b0f9f6f51f7b30c97a540.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3d55c3a2ad5b0f9f6f51f7b30c97a540.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3d55c3a2ad5b0f9f6f51f7b30c97a540.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-07T15:36:01+00:00","modified":"2020-08-21T19:02:44+00:00","filename":"3d55c3a2ad5b0f9f6f51f7b30c97a540.jpg","authentication":"5de9e5ee716ce832297be5803a624636","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_13_fl_479_004_01_o2.jpg","size":910801,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3600,"resolution_y":2462,"compression_ratio":0.034254031651473},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042748"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042748"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["042748"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3d55c3a2ad5b0f9f6f51f7b30c97a540.jpg","FileDateTime":1507390378,"FileSize":910801,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3600\" height=\"2462\"","Height":2462,"Width":3600,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:02 12:25:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:07:28 04:27:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:07:28 04:27:48","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2004,"ExifImageLength":1371,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":117,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/117","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"stamp U.S.POSTAGE 2 CENTS\npostmark GARDEN CITY NOV unclear\nMr. J.

Everyone has the golf craze - anyway I say \"three cheers for tennis.\"\nWell have you heard from the people to whom you wrote? Perhaps already you are a governess - such a title; but it sounds good anyway.

Prof Stall very kindly let us know that the books in Victorian Poetry we would buy would cost around $6.00!!","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":36797,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/36797","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ebc963b3f632af22b6977710e750f505.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ebc963b3f632af22b6977710e750f505.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ebc963b3f632af22b6977710e750f505.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ebc963b3f632af22b6977710e750f505.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-12T15:31:11+00:00","modified":"2020-04-07T17:36:40+00:00","filename":"ebc963b3f632af22b6977710e750f505.jpg","authentication":"8714fe6525e1d83ed25e7b5af2687abb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_13_fl_469_002_03_o2.jpg","size":1343840,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2424,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051332355457768},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["030711"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["030711"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["030711"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ebc963b3f632af22b6977710e750f505.jpg","FileDateTime":1507822266,"FileSize":1343840,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2424\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2424,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:02 12:17:37","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:07:28 03:07:11","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:07:28 03:07:11","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":56,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2074,"ExifImageLength":3080,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":117,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/117","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"French books cost 2.05; a Book of Reading in 19th Century Prose (Part One) this morning cost 1.80.

Just one now and then.\nI spent some money for something else this morning - 3.00 for the University Concert Course.  To go to any one of them would cost 3.00 and there is one of the five that I would pay 3.00 to hear - Unclear Friedman pianist.  Many from the school of music in Washburn went to Lawrence two years ago to hear him.  There are five of them which make the admission on 60 cents each.\nAm getting powerfully sleepy so no not so sleepy - as I am hungry!  So will stop and eat.  For tomorrow's classes I have the whole of Omar Khayyam to study; French; and four of Lamb's essays to read (4 times each she said) and pick to pieces as to learn unclear unclear, unclear his effect etc for my Imitation writing classes","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}]

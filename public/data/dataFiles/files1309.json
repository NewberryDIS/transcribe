The pale cheeks were blanched whiter, the trembling hearts beat faster, and the people moved about so softly that the footfalls upon the sidewalks were scarcely heard, and none dare speak much above a whisper.

On the 7th we started out on duty but were obliged to return in consequence of the severity of the weather.\nSunday, 8th  It being a pleasant day I accompanied Lieut. L__ to Charity Islands, distant eighteen miles. Wandered about the island and picked up some specimens of chrystal and gypsum, or strantian. The form of this island is very peculiar, having four very acute angles and convex sides, forming four fine, deep, commodious harbors, in either of which vessels may ride with safety let the wind be in whatever quarter it may, or however violent. From this circumstance it derives its name.\nMonday, 9th _ Commenced work where we left off on the 6th and surveyed to the camp. Passed Point au Chene, which is a low point, covered with a beautiful forest of oak, and from which a rocky bar extends for a mile or more into the Bay. Formerly, Voyageurs, on their way to Mackinaw crossed the Bay from this point. On the 10th the wind blew a gale, and the rain fell heavily. Capt Marsar, our hunter, killed a deer. This Capt. Marsar is a very peculiar man, a true hunter, and second only to Capt. Martin Scott as a rifleman. We attempted to move this day, before the storm came up, contrary to his advice, and the result was according to his prediction; every boat was swamped and we all had to swim to the shore,","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":106283,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/106283","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/dc6f85ecec6a734476bbb3d8aadb70de.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/dc6f85ecec6a734476bbb3d8aadb70de.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/dc6f85ecec6a734476bbb3d8aadb70de.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/dc6f85ecec6a734476bbb3d8aadb70de.jpg"},"added":"2020-09-25T01:53:41+00:00","modified":"2020-11-25T17:59:02+00:00","filename":"dc6f85ecec6a734476bbb3d8aadb70de.jpg","authentication":"67a5c64e70cb5d769dc5607ab7b8d318","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_815_VL01_00100_o2.jpg","size":1090429,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1897,"resolution_y":2327,"compression_ratio":0.082340296053215}},"item":{"id":1309,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1309","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"like a man in an ague fit.

It was indeed a narrow escape, for the act of \"sticking the pin\" brought the man's hand within four inches of the reptile, and had it pierced him in any other part of the body he would have bitten the man, and death would have ensued before any remedy could have been applied.\nThursday, 19th _ Wind and rain kept us in camp. The evil of Pine Island is very rich and is cultivated by the Indians. 20th. Lieut. P__ removed the camp to Thread river, while Lieut. L__ surveyed three other small islands. After a hard day's work supped on clams from the bay. This is the first time I ever ate them, or knew of their having been eaten, and I was surprised to find them so delicious. They have more the consistency and the flavor of the oyster than the clam.

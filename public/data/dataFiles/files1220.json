Fare $7.00 arrived at Lake Pepin Wednesday Eve April 29. Ice not out of the lake.Some 20 Boats waiting. Our boat the WS Nelson went into the ice and worked all night. Breaking ice to the great discomfort of nervous passengers. I enjoyed it much. Something to break the monotony of Steamboat life. Thursday morning we were joined by other Boats got through the lake at night and arrived at St. Paul at 6:30 A.M May 1st. I had a cold through all my journey and the day we got to Lake Pepin I was almost sick. laid in my berth all day , but watching the breaking of ice that night got me well, and have felt nicely all the time since. The scenery on the river is intensely beautiful and grand, evidently the design of a great architect.\nI find my folks here all but Theodore for whom I have many fears. I went to Cottage Grove May 2 and came back here yesterday.

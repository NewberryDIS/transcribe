Here ends the first scene. The next week Mr. Boudinot published some sarcastic remarks relative to the decision of Judge Clayton, and ended that is missionaries were agents of the general govenment, they would not acknowledge themselves the agents of Gen.

We therefore wrote the following notice to Mr. Boudinot, unclear\nCarmel April 12? 1831\nMr. Boudinot, Dear Sir,\nWe noticed in the Phoenix, not long since, some remarks concerning the late decision of Judge Clayton, which we couldn't altogether approve. We think his decision was in accordance with the opinion of Mr Evarts?, when he says that we are hereby the authority and under the protection of the \"U. States government.\" To us it appears that judge Clayton has merited the thanks of all the missionaries and the friends of missions, by the part he has acted.

The law of nations, and all those principles of equily by which the world was bound together; but though we could teach them the rights of man, their own rights, and how to govern and take care of themselves, yet when a political question was to be decided between them and the United States, it was no more our duty to enter the list of combattants to defend their political rights, than it would be in case of war, to enter their ranks and fight their battles. -- That if a dispute should arise between them and the Creeks, and if we supposed the Creeks were greatly abused, and therefore should attempt to defend their cause, would not the Cherokee at once say that we were acting out of character, and enquire, who made us judges and unknown over them.

Zion Jan. 19 1844?\nJohn Howard Payne Esq.\nDear Sir,\nThough I have been blamed by some of my missionary brethren for censuring those members of our church, who signed the New Echota treaty, as being guilty of a moral evil, yet unless ignorant of my own heart, I have not censured the signing of that treaty from any political or party motives, but for the same reason that I would censure any other course of conduct, which seemed directly opposed to the dictates of inspiration. Instead of any personal opposition to the treaty party, many of them were among my most favorite friends. This was the case especially with the family connecxions of Messrs. Ridge, and Boudinot. To them I was more especially indebted for ten thousand acts of kindness, than to almost any other families in the nation. And when I heard that the treaty was ratified, and knew in some measure, at least, the feelings of the people, and the consequent danger of Messrs. Ridge and Boudinot, I would not rest without advising them to take some measures to regain the favour of the people. As Mr. Northrop, Mr? Ridge's father, was then on a visit, at the house of Mr Ridge & addressed my letter to him, that he might, as he should judge expedient, read or communicate it to Mr. Ridge. I commenced by saying, that, though I might not be a politician, yet I might be a peace maker; and as a friend I begged the privilege of suggesting a few thoughts to our friends Ridge and Boudinot with regard to their endeavoring to communicate the minds of the people and the national council. I enquired if they could not address a communication to the general council, acknowledging the importance of the law they had violated, than in all communities, holding land in common, it was of vital importance that it should not be at the disposition of any one or two individuals but of a majority, or persons authorized by a majority; and that, under any common circumstances, they could not expect forgiveness in thus acting for the nation, But the condition of the nation was peculiar. These I proposed to them to state, in the clearest manner possible, the oppressive measures of Georgia and Alabama, by which the whole nation had been brought to the very verge of ruin, and urge that distress as a reason why they had adopted a measure which might be considered desperate, in order","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71680,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71680","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/faef6939c78ff22a0c2acba5fe3f9f62.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/faef6939c78ff22a0c2acba5fe3f9f62.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/faef6939c78ff22a0c2acba5fe3f9f62.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/faef6939c78ff22a0c2acba5fe3f9f62.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T14:46:49+00:00","modified":"2020-05-01T16:24:44+00:00","filename":"faef6939c78ff22a0c2acba5fe3f9f62.jpg","authentication":"f1086c9d92506291a122805604ab66af","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":2,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL09_00040_o2 copy.jpg","size":574995,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2258,"compression_ratio":0.047157021946659},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["052410+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["052410+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["052410+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"faef6939c78ff22a0c2acba5fe3f9f62.jpg","FileDateTime":1522680364,"FileSize":574995,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2258\"","Height":2258,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2258,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:19:44","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6485},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 05:24:10","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 05:24:10","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":68,"SubSecTimeDigitized":68,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2258,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1060,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1060","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"to pluck the people from the mouth of the lion, from that oppressive grasp likely to chill all the blood in their veins.

When the Moravian missionaries first came to this country, the council would scarcely admit missionaries of any kind, though at length some were permitted to stay on condition of their instructing the youth in literature; and our venerable father and mother. gamboled, by patient continuance in well doing for sixteen years, lived away the prejudices of the churches, so that they began to conclude it possible for some white men to be honest, and they were ready to allow missionaries, above all others to be such, because Mr. Gambold was a missionary. When we came, therefore, the door was quite open, and the Cherokees received us into their bosoms.

In A. 1819, when some of your people emigrated to the west, and were rather blamed for so doing. I told them that I loved those who went to the west just as I did those who remained here, and that I had myself a great desire to go there: And thus I have continued to say till the present time. A few years ago when some thought it it would be certain death for the Cherokees to go to the west, and that we all aught to be willing to sacrifice every thing, almost, to prevent it, I said \"I would not turn my hand to remove them, or to keep them here; for this plain reason, \"It was none of my business:\" and if it were I knew nothing what would be for their good.

I have no idea but that those who proposed that article , acted from entire good will to the A.B.C.F.M. and to the mission cause generally. But they did not know, or did not recollect at the time, the statement made officially by Mr. Moyt, and incidentally by others, at the commencement of  our missions among the Cherokees. You know, Sirs, that from the first settlement of this continent by the whites, the Indians have been continually crowded and pushed back, so that all, almost, within hearing of white people, have become chafed and sore on every side, so that now they can scarcely be touched by a white man, without cringing and shrinking away from his presence. White people in general have treated the Indian in such a manner that it has become very difficult for even honest white men to convince them that they are honest. This has been the great barrier in the way of missions among the Indians, and of Indian improvement. But by the persevering labours at the United Brethren, the Cherokees became convinced that it was possible for white men to be faithful and kind. When we came therefore we found the door open into every part of the country, though the people were not all entirely relieved from their fears. Some had still remaining apprehensions that we should at some future period call on them either for money or land, or pay for what we were doing. To remove these fears we assured them again and again that we never should. Mr. A. Moyt the then superintendent of the Cherokee mission, declared officially in a letter to the council that we never should call on them for land, or any thing else or pay for what we were doing. And it is stated also by Cherokees who heard him, that at a Council at Fosterville May 1819 Mr. Moyt, after reading a communication from Mr. Worcester, told the council that what we were doing for them was entirely gratuitous, designed simply for their good and that, if, at any time, the council should consider our labour no longer needed, and not desire our continuance longer, we should immediately retire and leave our improvements for the benefit of the nation. A similar statement, according to the testimony of the Cherokees, was made by Mr. Hall to the people at Carmel respecting what improvements might be made there. Now, whether the above statements were judicious, or whether the above persons were fully authorized to make  them, is not very material. They were made, and without doubt were approved by the Presid.? Com. The journal kept at this unclear. and approved and printed in Boston shows clearly that it was not expected or designed that the Cherokees","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71692,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71692","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5d84645d4eecdd17e29bcbb7c77a7c0b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5d84645d4eecdd17e29bcbb7c77a7c0b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5d84645d4eecdd17e29bcbb7c77a7c0b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5d84645d4eecdd17e29bcbb7c77a7c0b.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T14:46:58+00:00","modified":"2020-05-24T01:42:03+00:00","filename":"5d84645d4eecdd17e29bcbb7c77a7c0b.jpg","authentication":"9f899c461ff459033c4f55e65cf57d56","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":14,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL09_00052_o2 copy.jpg","size":609291,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2245,"compression_ratio":0.050259094283593},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["052936+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["052936+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["052936+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5d84645d4eecdd17e29bcbb7c77a7c0b.jpg","FileDateTime":1522680364,"FileSize":609291,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2245\"","Height":2245,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2245,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:19:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5923},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 05:29:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 05:29:36","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":86,"SubSecTimeDigitized":86,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2245,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1060,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1060","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"should ever pay for any thing we were doing for them. But here it may be said that the Cherokees do not pay for mission improvements, but the United States pay for them, even according to the treaty. Now if the Cherokee believed this it would do very well, because there is but little reason to fear but what they will have money enough. But the fact is they do not believe it. They say that the $5,000,000 was offered for their land and possessions, that is, for their possessions, and that what is taken from that is taken from them. It is also said that Mr. Schermerhorn, previous to his council at New Echota, said that the Cherokees had received the benefit of mission improvements, and therefore they should pay for them: and that, at the council, he took the same position, arguing in the same manner that the Cherokee ought to pay for said improvements because they had enjoyed the benefit of them referring to Catherine Brown as a specimen of improvement. On the other hand (it is said) Mr. James has opposed the motions on the ground that the Cherokees never agreed to pay for missions improvements, but that if they must be paid for the United States, and not the churches ought to pay for them. But Mr. Schermerhorn still hesitated, saying that to oppose paying for said improvements was to oppose religions, whereas would render this cause unpopular or to this effort. Being strengthened by a few of the Cherokees he at length carried his point in making the Cherokees pay for mission improvements, and accordingly decided that pay for said improvements should be taken out of the five millions of Dollars to be paid the Cherokees. Whether the above statements are correct, those who were present can determine; but while they are supposed correct, they establish the point in the minds of such as have heard of them that the council (at New Echota) decided that the Cherokees and not the United States should pay for mission improvements\nNow as Mr. Schermerhorn was a minister, who preferred much friendship to the mission cause, and visited all the stations, the people generally will not readily, believe that the missionaries were ignorant of his intentions. They doubtless blame us as having been instrumental, directly or indirectly, in bringing this about so as to secure payment for our stations. And while they suppose this, they will honestly class us among other white men who have manifested said duplicity such double dealing as to forfeit forever their confidence.\nAnd further the resolution to support the missionaries on the way, and a year after their arrival at Arkansas and, eminated from a mind entirely above the common Indians, and how ardently so were all might desire to have all participate in such a mind, yet they are not prepared for it.

Now, as a political or national thing, I should be far from opposing, or saying any thing against the treaty, because in that light it does not concern me any more than it does one of your slaves and I think I have never desired to sway the minds of of the people in their national affairs. I have never desired to prevent their going to the West, nor to send them there; though they are doubtless sensible many of them at least , that we, as missionaries, should rejoice exceedingly in being stationed near the larger tribes of the west, where we might hope to extend our influence far? beyond the limits of the Cherokee nation. But our object in desiring to go with the Cherokees would be entirely defeated unless we could retain their confidence. Here a question may arise, if you do not wish to keep the Cherokees here, why do you keep up your school? Why not break up and go to the west? In answering this question I must beg a candid attention to the following things viz\nFirst, As we do not wish to prevent the Cherokees from emigrating, so on the other hand we do not wish to?urge their removal, lest they should say, as some do already, that our object in coming here was to get them away. To dismiss our school and go to the west before the people are ready to go, would be as much as telling them they must go to the west also, or not enjoy the benefit of our labour, which would be taking a political stand altogether inconsistent with the mission character. \nSecond. Our only business among the Cherokees is to communicate religious and scientific knowledge, therefore to leave, the people, is, of course, to leave our associate business, for something which does not concern us. Let the people determine to go and prepare to start, and I should rejoice to start with them any month or week or day, and go with them to any place where they might be obliged to go. But third, there is another reason why I feel it important to keep the schools in active operation till all are prepared to  go, or at least till all missionaries are prepared to leave the country which cannot be till the churches are prepared to go. When Mr. Kingsbury first came to this country he requested of the council permission to establish mission schools, where children  might be boarded and taught , and where the gospel might be preached.

In the treaty lately ratified by the senate of the U. States, is an article to the following effect viz, What mission improvements shall be valued and paid for in the same manner as those of Cherokees, that is out of the $5,000,000, given them for their entire provisions, etc. should this article be carried into effect I fear the cause of missions among the Cherokee would be greatly endangered.\n\nThe council which made that treaty consisted of only seventy or eighty persons, none of whom were authorized to act in behalf of the nation. They proceeded in direct opposition to the national council and the voice of the people, Now with regard to the expediency of their course, and the necessity of the treaty, as a national or political thing, as a missionary, I have nothing to say. Yet should missionary societies take the advantage of that treaty, and wrest from the nation $20,000 or more, in the face of their solemn and almost universal protest. I fear the money would be much worse than useless as to the conversion of the Cherokees hereafter.\" (Remarks as in the letter Mr. J. Ridge pledge of missionaries unclear smudge) The Cherokee council never agreed to pay for our improvements, and it is evident they never would have received us on such conditions; because in that case we might add field to field, and house to house, to the entire neglect of our appropriate business, till our improvements might be valued at a million of Dollars. The council simply permitted us to improve land as a loan, which we needed it for the use of schools, but in case we wished to remove, or dismiss our schools, unless we sold our improvements to a Cherokee citizen (we would sell them to no other) They reverted back to the nation in the same manner as if left by a Cherokee citizen. By occupying the land we acquired no right to it  whatsoever, nor to pay from the nation for our labours on it. true? it is evident that even the council that made the treaty, would not have acceded to the article in","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71696,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71696","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/95026607e9ee4875bcf35edfd2d00486.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/95026607e9ee4875bcf35edfd2d00486.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/95026607e9ee4875bcf35edfd2d00486.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/95026607e9ee4875bcf35edfd2d00486.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T14:47:01+00:00","modified":"2020-05-25T01:01:29+00:00","filename":"95026607e9ee4875bcf35edfd2d00486.jpg","authentication":"137e4146ab7eb07de68b8e1a07e4ae2d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":18,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL09_00057_o2 copy.jpg","size":526039,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2263,"compression_ratio":0.0430466768138},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["053105+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["053105+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["053105+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"95026607e9ee4875bcf35edfd2d00486.jpg","FileDateTime":1522680364,"FileSize":526039,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2263\"","Height":2263,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2263,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:19:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4918},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 05:31:05","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 05:31:05","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":75,"SubSecTimeDigitized":75,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2263,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1060,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1060","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"question how it not been urged and almost forced upon them.

Secy to which the following is a reply, dated, Brainard Sept. 5 1836.\n\n         Rev. David Greene,\n                                           Dear Sir\n                                                                 I had the pleasure of receiving last week yours of Aug. 3, and while I attempt to make a few remarks in reply, I hope, Sir, you will not think I would need only increase your labours, or troubles, or act the part of a stubborn boy, always determined to have the last word. But doubtless relief to your own mind as well as justice to the course of truth requires me to say something in reply. And First, you remark \"Your view of the allowance to the Board in the light of a  unclear, seems to us to be wholly a distorted view, and if you talk with the Cherokees in that manner you may be sure they will soon murmur.\" Now, as to conversing freely on the subject as stated above, I have not mentioned it to yourself to Mr. Boudinot and Mr. Ridge, and doubtless to some missionaries, though I do not now recollect. I told Mr. Boudinot, in a letter to him on the subject, that I said but little about it except to missionaries, and such Cherokees as were in favour of removing, as I should certainly desire to assail producing any unnecessary excitement against the treaty. Second you proceed \"Nor ought the Cherokees, or you to say that the nation will receive just so much less than they would receive if if nothing were to be paid to our Board.\" I presume I am to understand by this, that the above is a truth not to be told the Indians, but to be kept concealed from them. Were it possible to obliterate this truth from their minds, by any words of truth. I should desire to speak with the voice of thunder, and say, \"Tell it not in G. ath?, publish it not in the streets of Tskalon??\" But it is not possible. From the very force of the treaty, everyone must see, that every Dollar, taken from the five millions, for any purpose whatever, leaves that Dollar less to be paid the nation at the West. The Cherokees know this without our telling them of it' and every attempt to deceive them in this matter, would only bring upon ourselves additional disgrace. \n    Third. Your letter proceeds, \"We do not now make them pay us for what we have done for them. The United States pays them, and pays us?? Dear Sir, though I would be slow to speak, yet as I live on the ground, and therefore must be acquainted with  some things unknown to persons in Boston, you will doubtless permit me, to state some of the reasons why I have spoken of the Cherokees as paying for mission improvements.\n     Final?. I have satisfactory evidence that Mr. Schermerhorn stated positively, last fall, that the Cherokees","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71698,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71698","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7d97e38c496aef1ff706478e382fccd4.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7d97e38c496aef1ff706478e382fccd4.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7d97e38c496aef1ff706478e382fccd4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7d97e38c496aef1ff706478e382fccd4.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T14:47:03+00:00","modified":"2020-05-25T23:56:38+00:00","filename":"7d97e38c496aef1ff706478e382fccd4.jpg","authentication":"60edf159ab4156f5f4b5fbe42deaa256","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":20,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL09_00059_o2 copy.jpg","size":578201,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2259,"compression_ratio":0.04739896381552},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["053158+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["053158+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["053158+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7d97e38c496aef1ff706478e382fccd4.jpg","FileDateTime":1522680364,"FileSize":578201,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2259\"","Height":2259,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2259,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:20:00","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5715},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 05:31:58","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 05:31:58","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":79,"SubSecTimeDigitized":79,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2259,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1060,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1060","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"had received the benefit of mission improvements and therefore they should pay for them.\nSecond. An intelligent and respectable Cherokee, who attended the council at New Echota, when the treaty was made, told me in the business of Mr. Butrick, that Mr. Schermerhorn took the same stand there, viz, that the Cherokee had enjoyed the benefit of mission improvements and therefore ought to pay for them. Many of the Cherokees objected to this, but especially Mr. James Star a prominent treaty man opposed Mr. Schermerhorn with great vehemence on the ground that the Cherokee never agreed to pay missionaries for their improvements. Mr. Boudinot, however, united with Mr. Schermerhorn, in considering it just and proper for Cherokees themselves to pay for mission improvements; and through his influence\/and the determination of Mr. Schermerhorn. The vote was carried that the Indians should pay for SI? improvements and of course that the valuations of such improvements should be paid out of the Five Millions of Dollars (Did not everyone know that what was paid out of that sum the Cherokees paid?)\nThird. I have also conversed with Majors Bell and Williams of unclear, both treaty men, who attended the council. From them I received no different impressions from the above. I think both of them mentioned the objections of Mr. Star, and both concurred with him in opinion +\nNow, Sir, if Majors. Schermerhorn and Boudinot, will come forward publicly, and affirm that they never unclear say the Cherokees themselves ought to pay for mission improvements -- if they will declare that they did say in the council at New Echota, that the United States and not the Cherokees, ought to pay for mission improvements:-- unclear if they will come forward and prove to the eye of reason, that the Cherokees will have just as much divided among them at the west as they would have had if nothing had been paid for mission improvements, I say, if they will do these things I shall rejoice indeed to go to the poor Indians, and convince them by proving to their understandings, that the U. States and not the nation, pay for our improvements. \nBut talk is vain.

But I do it because I am confident that if that article is carried into effect, and the money paid and received according to it, a wound incurable will be inflicted, and a stain will be cast on the mission character, which millions of Dollars, and all the labours of your missionaries can never efface. In consequence of it, Mr. James Star, it seems, though a bowing? man in the treaty party, has taken measures to get a letter from Arkansas, signed by twelve persons, saying that they have now more missionaries there than they need, and therefore desire that no more may be sent. Nearly the whole, I presume, of the treaty party, together with all the rest of the nation are opposed to that article. Not because they are stingy; for many of them doubtless, would be willing individually, to support a mission family one or two years, without compensation. I will remember with what cheerfulness they supported my interpreter and myself and horse the year I was at Creek Path. tho with what delight.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71701,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71701","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8b5060d0210bc194370943e057bf9721.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8b5060d0210bc194370943e057bf9721.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8b5060d0210bc194370943e057bf9721.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8b5060d0210bc194370943e057bf9721.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T14:47:05+00:00","modified":"2020-05-27T02:15:43+00:00","filename":"8b5060d0210bc194370943e057bf9721.jpg","authentication":"6d9ff1a5eb0e3fbf9210bd0a05debb67","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":23,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL09_00063_o2.jpg","size":559161,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2321,"compression_ratio":0.044613672267701},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["053420+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["053420+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["053420+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8b5060d0210bc194370943e057bf9721.jpg","FileDateTime":1522680364,"FileSize":559161,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2321\"","Height":2321,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2321,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:20:04","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5745},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 05:34:20","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 05:34:20","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":68,"SubSecTimeDigitized":68,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2321,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1060,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1060","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"they have fed and sustained us when travelling among them.

The character of this guard has been sufficiently made known, in the history of missionaries whom they dragged to prison.\nThe legislature of Georgia soon ordered a survey of the country, in direct violation of the intercourse law, and existing treaties with the Cherokees,  After this the land was disposed of by lot, and though the Cherokees were not to be dispossessed immediately, yet they were limited to their present improvements, and forbid clearing or occupying any new land, and also forbid employing any white man to assist them in any business whatever. By violating this law, they forfeited their whole improvements, to be taken by the fortunate drawer. Now, as the Cherokees had long been in the habit of showing kindness to white people, and especially to strangers, they could not at once overcome the current of their own feelings so that when a white man came along with his family, and plead necessity, and wished to labour only a few days to get something to carry them farther, the Cherokees could not readily turn him away.

The next autumn, therefore, they gave notice of a council to be held at, or near John Ridge's house. After the utmost exertion, they collected about fifty persons. This faction organized themselves into a council, called the council of words scratched out Two men?. This council took the liberty to consult about measures of a national character, independently of the national council, and appointed a delegation to represent them in Washington City, as the Arkansas faction how done the year before. This delegation, headed by Ridge and Boudinot, taking the ground of A. Ross, entered still farther into arrangements for a treaty, and not only made propositions, but had them printed, and sent through the nation. This excited, and considerably alarmed the people especially as the President turned his attention from the prospect authorities of the nation, and the delegation appointed by the national council, to this factious hasty","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71717,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71717","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b18c1a35173cf7becbb2dbf80d0e52c6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b18c1a35173cf7becbb2dbf80d0e52c6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b18c1a35173cf7becbb2dbf80d0e52c6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b18c1a35173cf7becbb2dbf80d0e52c6.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T14:47:17+00:00","modified":"2020-06-02T02:46:40+00:00","filename":"b18c1a35173cf7becbb2dbf80d0e52c6.jpg","authentication":"a497cb93f21272903f87ba5663f43865","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":39,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL09_00082_o2 copy.jpg","size":746586,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2282,"compression_ratio":0.060585743499854},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["230054+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["230054+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["230054+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b18c1a35173cf7becbb2dbf80d0e52c6.jpg","FileDateTime":1522680365,"FileSize":746586,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2282\"","Height":2282,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2282,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:20:20","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":7212},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 23:00:54","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 23:00:54","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":40,"SubSecTimeDigitized":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2282,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1060,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1060","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"12\n\nthe tskansan? party now assumed the name of the Ridge party, from the idea, doubtless, that the popularity of Ridge would sustain the honour of the cause he had espoused.

This party pretended that there was no national government, nor regular chiefs in the national council, because the time for which they had been elected had expired, and they had not been re-elected according to the constitution. Yet this argument was unsound. When Mr. J. Ross, the principal chief, found that on account of the oppressive laws of Georgia, the nation could not elect its officers according to the letter of the constitution, he called a council of the people, and enquired what should be done. The people replied, \"Let the men now in office retain their respective stations, till such times as we can elect others.\" This was the voice of the people, and it is evident, beyond a doubt, that the principal chief and national council, held their authority by the suffrage of the people, and did not, at any time, transcend the bounds prescribed by their constituents.

This union was accordingly smudge affected. The Reverend Agent made his appearance in the council. His professed object was to make a treaty with the people, but his real object was, evidently, to impose a treaty on the nation according to his own terms. But in order to this, he saw the necessity of putting down Mr. J. Ross, the principal chief, who has even been known to be the firm and unshaken defender of the nights of his people. In the early stage of the business, therefore, if I am rightly informed, he accused the principal chief of falsehood. On this, a member of the council arose, and proposed dispensing with the remainder of Mr. Schermerhorn's address, and of course he could not be heard through. But the honourable agent, instead of being ashamed of his impoliteness, to say the best, was intoxicated with anger, and mad because the reputation of Mr. Ross stood on a basis too firm to be shaken by the breath of slander. On learning the disposition of the agent, the council abandoned all hope of treating with him and appointed a delegation to go to Washington City, and adjust all their difficulties with the secretary of war. \n\n Mr. Schemmerhorn then, in his own name, appointed a council at New Echota, for the purpose of treating with the Cherokees, and declared that all Cherokees who did not attend that council, should be considered as coinciding with whatever might be done by those who did attend.

The daily words in the United Brethrens Text book, were (Ps. 119:9) \"I am thine, save me.\" This day a number of Georgia citizens, near New Echota, took sixteen Cherokees, and drove them to the fort, and then requested permission of General Scott to take them out, and whip them. In this, however, they were not gratified. Those sixteen Cherokees were taken by the citizens, probably, to remind General Scott that no farther delay could be made with regard to collecting the Indians. The soldiers at the various posts, now commenced that work which will, doubtless, long eclypse the glory of the United States. \nGeneral Scott gave orders that no indecent language should be used towards the Indians; and that in case any of them attempted to escape by flight, no gun should be discharged at them. But these orders, I believe, were obeyed or not, according to the disposition of the under officers and soldiers. In the limits of Georgia these were supposed to be about eight thousand Cherokees. These were taken first, and in general I believe they were taken just as they were found by the soldiers, without permission to stop, either for friends, or property. As the soldiers advanced towards a certain house, two little children, it was said, in a fright, fled to the woods.

For this offense, however, he was hand cuffed, and punished on his arrival at the fort; and on leaving the fort, was again whipped a hundred lashes. Those taken to the fort at New Echota, it is said, were confined day and night in the open air, with scarcely clothes to cover them when lying on the naked ground.\nThursday May 31. Just before night a young lieutenant called and requested accommodation for two or three officers, and permission for a company of Cherokees to camp near. Though we are not in the habit of entertaining any white men, yet for the sake of the poor Cherokees, we resolved to accommodate the above officers.\nA little before sunset the above company, of about two hundred Cherokees, were driven into our lane. The day had been rainy, and of course, all men, women and children were dripping wet, with no change of clothing, and scarcely a blanket fit to cover them. As some of the women, when taken from their houses, had on their poorest dress, this of course was the amount of their clothing for a journey of eight hundred miles.\nAs soon as permission was obtained from the officers, we opened every door to these poor sufferers. Mothers brought their little babes to our fire, and stripped off their only covering to dry. Heart rending indeed, was the sight of those little captives. Their lips, blue and trembling with cold, seemed yet to force a smile of gratitude for this kind reception. We wept, and wept, and still weep at the thought of that affecting scene.

In the company were two blind men, and several adults, beside some children who were unwell. One poor old Creek, being sick, we nourished by our fire.  A little before dark, the captain took our interpreter, Mr. Johnson Reece, and went to those who were lodged in the meeting house, and told them he had power to destroy them, and was ordered to do so if they did not behave well. He then told them that after the beating of the drum, no one must be seen out doors till morning. The interpreter told him that some might be obliged to go out, being sick with the dysentery. The captain replied, that in that case they must call and get permission, or they would be in danger of being shot. \nJune 1.

Most of our neighbours are now with us, going this evening or tomorrow, to the camps, choosing to go in by themselves, rather than be driven by soldiers; and though -lined out last week, it is said, a young officer told the people in this settlement, generally that they had better go to the agency, as they would fare better there than at Ross' landing. Accordingly most of the people started on Saturday for that plan. But when the chief officer had knowledge of this, he sent the same young man, and other soldiers to order them back. This morning, therefore, they returned wet, and weary, and some of them almost exhausted, especially one old lady near a hundred years old, who had travelled most of the day and night before.\nDuring this week, I visited the camps, and found our beloved brother Epenetus Tehaia??,  with his wife and","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71726,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71726","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d06f19f258455b22f7cba2b887c3c4a7.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d06f19f258455b22f7cba2b887c3c4a7.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d06f19f258455b22f7cba2b887c3c4a7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d06f19f258455b22f7cba2b887c3c4a7.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T14:47:24+00:00","modified":"2020-06-19T22:20:24+00:00","filename":"d06f19f258455b22f7cba2b887c3c4a7.jpg","authentication":"2517b5c0d7f6a7cd101c470c5c21da34","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":48,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL09_00091_o2.jpg","size":798731,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2294,"compression_ratio":0.064478268591172},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["230551+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["230551+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["230551+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d06f19f258455b22f7cba2b887c3c4a7.jpg","FileDateTime":1522680365,"FileSize":798731,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2294\"","Height":2294,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2294,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:20:29","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6810},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 23:05:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 23:05:51","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":21,"SubSecTimeDigitized":21,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2294,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1060,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1060","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"21                                                                    Template:Scribble?\n\ntwo children were - lined out among the prisoners.

At length the officers concerned, applied to the Cherokee council, requesting that body to take the Creeks and deliver them up. But this, as might well be supposed, the Cherokees refused to do, but on the contrary presented a petition to the secretary of war, praying that these Creeks might be considered and treated in all respects, as Cherokee citizens. This being granted, these Creeks were accordingly let alone, till the Cherokees were taken, and then they shared a like fate.

He was hand cuffed, and his hands considerably swolen when he came in last week.

By this treatment many of them have already been reduced to sickness, and are hastening to a premature grave. Driving the Indians under such circumstances and then forcing them, to overflowing, into filthy boats, in this hot season, -- landing them at Little Rock, a most sickly place, to wait other means of conveyance two hundred miles up the Arkansas river, or to land them in the heat of summer, to remain any where on that sickly river, is only a most expensive and painful method of putting the poor people to death. The first company sent down the river, including those dear trembling doves who spent a night at our house, were, it seems, literally crammed into the boat. Where was a flat bottomed boat about one hundred feet long, twenty feet wide, and two stories high, fastened to an old steam boat. This was so filled unclear words scratched out that the timber, it is said began to crack, and give way, and the boat itself unclear words lined out was on the point of sinking. Some of the Cherokees were called out, which this boat was lashed to the ste4am boat, and some small boats brought forward to take in those who had been recalled.

Mr. Nave, a white man with a Cherokee family, says that as a company of Cherokee prisoners were about to cross the creek at his house, he heard a horseman say, as he rode up that a certain old Creek woman had failed so as to be unable to walk, and therefore a wagon must stop for her. Soon after, however a foot man, soldier, came up, and all the wagons moved on. He supposes therefore that the old woman had been killed and put out of the way: as he and several others hunted but could find nothing of her. Such an act would not be surprising, because we are credibbly informed that as certain soldiers were going with a wagon up Lookout mountain below Willstown, they had a Creek prisoner with them. As the wagon sank in the mud they directed him to assist in some way, but he did not understand their meaning, and therefore a soldier stepped towards him, with the muzzle of his gun forward. The poor Creek touched the gun to turn it from him, when almost instantly five or six balls were shot through his body, and then he was thrown in the mud, from whence the Cherokees took his corpse and buried it.                                                                                85","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71737,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71737","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/bbe107e5659480fd190953b25df669a8.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/bbe107e5659480fd190953b25df669a8.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/bbe107e5659480fd190953b25df669a8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/bbe107e5659480fd190953b25df669a8.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T14:47:32+00:00","modified":"2020-06-21T22:09:24+00:00","filename":"bbe107e5659480fd190953b25df669a8.jpg","authentication":"3bf4664697325b2f0e309f4fc0730cbe","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":59,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL09_00102_o2 copy.jpg","size":702686,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2273,"compression_ratio":0.057249026413127},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["230826+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["230826+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["230826+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"bbe107e5659480fd190953b25df669a8.jpg","FileDateTime":1522680365,"FileSize":702686,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2273\"","Height":2273,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2273,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:20:38","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6400},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 23:08:26","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 23:08:26","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":62,"SubSecTimeDigitized":62,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2273,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1060,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1060","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"initials?                                                                                      32\nAlso when the soldiers were in pursuit of a few? distressed and afflicted Creeks at Red Clay, they wantonly? shot a poor man dead on the spot.

The poor Cherokees are not only exposed to temporal evils, but also to every species of moral desolation. The other day a gentleman informed me that he saw six soldiers about two Cherokee women. The women stood by a tree, and the soldiers with a bottle of liquor were endeavouring to entice them to drink, though the women, as yet were risting -lined out resisting them. He made this known to the commanding officer but we presume no notice was taken of it, as it was reported that those soldiers had those women with them the whole night afterward. A young married woman, a member of the Methodist society, was at the camps with her friends, though her husband was not there at the time. The soldiers, it is said, caught her, dragged her about, and at length, either through fear or otherwise, induced her to drink; and then seduced her away, so that she is now an out cast even among her own relatives.

The Indians were robbed of their guns, and in the heat of summer, huddled into camps, or driven beneath a burning sun to the west. The fever and dysentery are now desolating the camps. Most of the infants fall victims to disease. Being destitute of milk and butter, and greens, and all kinds of vegetables, of which they have been accustomed to an abundant supply, and confined to the coarsest corn meal bread and meat, the little children, as well as many others, readily sicken and die.

We were informed to day that when the Cherokees in Georgia were taken, women would sometimes spread a blanket on the floor to put a bed or bedding in, when the soldiers would snatch it away, saying, there were others appointed to take care of property. Thus the poor people were robbed by the very means said to be appointed for their benefit. Because agents were appointed to look up property after the Indians were gone, therefore they must not take even their necessary clothing. And it is evident that a mere trifle was ever given to the owners. Thus a horse worth one hundred Dollars was sold, it is said, for twelve, and twenty or thirty ducks, for twenty five cents.

They were not allowed to stop or rest on account of sickness. They were driven on as long as they could walk, and then thrown into wagons tried when the waggoners perceived some to be in the agonies of death, and informed the waggon master, his order was, Drive on, Drive on.

Have they robbed, or plundered? Or have they done any wrong to the United States, for which that powerful nation is thus putting them to the torture? \nJuly 28 We learn that General Scott has resigned the farther removal of the Cherokees to their own chiefs allowing a stipulated sum to defray the expenses. Visited a poor old woman, at the point of death. While standing by her, a number of waggons passed swiftly by. An involuntary sigh from her breast, led me to consider how dreadful that sound must be to her ears. Such unclear brought her from her peaceful home -- from her husband who was left for the time, - from her family connexions, who had fled to the woods. -- marked her aged and withering frame, -- hurried her away from all the scenes of her childhood to camps, where she was guarded as a prisoner of war, and deprived of all those preparations of food so congenial, and necessary to her health. And eventually those waggons were hurrying her to a sudden grave. For this poor woman I have had a peculiar tenderness in prayer, and still love to weep for her. Just night two poor Creek Indians arrived, having travelled all day with nothing to eat. \nAug. 7.

It is probable that the United States in getting the Indians from this country will destroy at least ten thousand, mostly women and children and helpless old people. .A few years ago enrolling agents by various means seduced about eleven hundred to enroll. Of these six hundred went in one company, of whom, as I was informed by one of the company, only about one hundred and sixteen survived one year. The other company of five hundred shared, doubtless a similar fate, though perhaps, not quite the same mortality. Of the three thousand forced off this summer, it is evident by various reports that a great part are dead. \nAug. 20. A gentleman from Tennessee called a few minutes. She says he was told by a lady, who saw a a company of Cherokees as they were driven to Calhoon, that she was informed of a woman in the company, who, on being seized with the pains of childbirth, entreated permission to retire, but as this was forbidden, she was compelled to fall in the street, and in the midst of a company of soldiers, pass through the pains of a travelling woman. This lady said that she was also informed that in another company six children were born in like circumstances. We also hear that when the last company were taken over the river at Ross landing, a woman in the pains of childbirth walked as long as possible, and then fell on the bank of the river, when a soldier came up and stabbed her with his bayonet which together with other pains soon caused her death.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71748,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71748","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/0351d09849e351cf6e5dcf1ef1d1612e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/0351d09849e351cf6e5dcf1ef1d1612e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/0351d09849e351cf6e5dcf1ef1d1612e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0351d09849e351cf6e5dcf1ef1d1612e.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T14:47:41+00:00","modified":"2020-06-25T02:04:58+00:00","filename":"0351d09849e351cf6e5dcf1ef1d1612e.jpg","authentication":"f4f32949bf6c56614fb0f00772ad1b21","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":70,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL09_00113_o2.jpg","size":826885,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2281,"compression_ratio":0.067131456313832},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["231122+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["231122+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["231122+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0351d09849e351cf6e5dcf1ef1d1612e.jpg","FileDateTime":1522680366,"FileSize":826885,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2281\"","Height":2281,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2281,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:20:49","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6716},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 23:11:22","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 23:11:22","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":71,"SubSecTimeDigitized":71,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2281,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1060,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1060","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"43                                                                                                                    scribble scratched out\n\nSept. 3. Our respected friend Green wood, left us. He is a very respectable Indian, but probably hastening to the grave. The distresses, and exposures of the sum ner post, have brought on him a cough and debility which will probably end in the consumption, especially as his distress and exposures are still to be continued. Thus with multitudes of others, who were not robust, or of healthy constitutions. The grief, the anxiety, the distress of body and mind, they have been obliged to endure, for three months past have broken them down, while their present exposures and prospect of future sufferings, are still urging their feeble steps to the grave, where most of their infants and such 2 words lined out of their friends as were sickly when their sufferings commenced, are already at rest. Dear little infants! O how distressing to see their little feeble hands holding to their mothers bosoms, and pulling back to life, as unfeeling strangers snatch them away, and drive them lonely to the silent tomb. Thus when the dear little children were sick in the last word lined out company, they were taken from the mothers arms, and thrown into waggons, and driven on over a rough road to suffer and die alone. Thus one waggoner noted as he returned, that two died in his waggon on the way to Waterloo.

When we hear of their sickness, we start as usual for their relief or comfort; but soon despair checks our zeal and prevents unclear & they are houselss. The have, many of them at least only a few barks overhead, having them all exposed to the damp night air, though they have been accustomed to warm houses.\n2. They have no provision suitable for sick persons.

They can be stationary but a short time. The officers are ordering all to their own detachments, and very shortly all must set out on a journey of seven or eight hundred miles; and should they live to accomplish that journey, they will find themselves in a sickly country, destitute, mostly of house & home and of property to help themselves with. Thus the prospect before them is overwhelming. There seems to be no place, nor means nor time for the recovery of any who are now sick. Their death of course seems almost inevitable, unless prevented by a myracle of money.\nSept 8. A few Cherokees called on their way from the agency. I suppose they had been to the agency for money. It is said by some, that in this, they acknowledge the treaty. But the case stands thus, the principal chief, on returning from Washington, by permission from General Scott, convened the national council. They took into consideration the present state of the people. They had been taken prisoners by United States troops, and torn from all their possessions. Now the question arose whether they should leave them so, or whether they should charge the United with the value of their possessions. This latter course was adopted, and it was resolved that each Cherokee might bring a claim against the United States to the amount of what he supposed his possessions were worth. And by order of General Scott, these claims were paid. In this however, there is no reference to the treaty, nor acknowledgment of it, in any manner whatever. The principal chief, however, and how many others I cannot tell, bring no claim, and receives nothing for all his possessions. \nOct. 4. Brother Hawk, and his family were brought to the encampment. He seems just gone with the consumption. He was taken from the waggon, and laid on the ground, having a bed under him. A tent was formed of two bed quilts to keep the night air from him. \nOct. 12.

These poor people were, doubtless, almost desperate. The country was sickly, and they were thrown into it in the most sickly season, and in a manner the most calculated to produce sickness, and not only so, but on a river, overflowing its banks with whisky, accompanied with unprincipled men, masters of the black art, to seduce the unwary to perdition. Who could suppose that these poor Indians, under such circumstances, having money put into their hands, would resist temptations to drink, especially as they were doubtless told that liquor would be likely to prevent sickness.

Nation June 5 1839.\n \n\nVisited the Cherokee council. This council was appointed by the chiefs of the old settlers, at the request of those who came in last winter and spring. The object was to form a united government suited to the present population and the exigencies of the times. But now, in the threshold, a very serious difficulty meets them. Some, at least, of the old settlers chiefs seem unwilling to allow the new settlers any national existence whatever, but consider the chiefs and counsellors from the east, in no other light than common citizens, to be received as such, under the laws of the old settlers. But the late emigrants, i.e. The nation from the East, consisting of sixteen thousand, except as they have died since their arrest, say that the violent measures by which they were involuntarily torn from all their possessions, did not affect their laws, or their right of self government. They did not voluntarily leave their own lands, and have never brought themselves under obligations to obey the laws of this country. Their views are more clearly expressed in the following resolutions of the national council before leaving the Nation.\nWhereas, the title of the Cherokee people to their lands, is the most ancient, pure, and absolute known to man; its date is beyond the reach of human record; its validity, confirmed and illustrated by possession and enjoyment, antecedent to all pretense of claim, by any other position of the human race.\nAnd whereas the free consent of the Cherokee people, is in dispensable to a valid transfer of the Cherokee title; and whereas the Cherokee people have, neither by themselves nor their representatives, given such consent; it follows, the original title and ownership of of said lands, still rest in the Cherokee Nation, unimpaired and absolute.\nResolved, therefore, by the National Committee and council, and people of the Cherokee nation, in general council assembled, that the whole Cherokee Territory, as described in the 1st article of the treaty of 1819, between the United States and the Cherokee nation, and also in the constitution of the Cherokee Nation, still remains the rightful and undoubted property of the said Cherokee nation; and that

While there, three Cherokees came up, and asked him for medicine. He started with them to the house, but had proceeded but a few steps, when he was thrown down, and stabbed in the back; but as the knife broke, a tomahawk was taken to kill him. His face was cut, and his head very much bruised. This procedure has been urged as a specimen of Indian treachery. But why? The unhappy victim according to their laws they supposed to have forfeited his life and with it every favour he might have expected from his people.

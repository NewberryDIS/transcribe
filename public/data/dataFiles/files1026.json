PIckering call'd at our Lodgeing & gave us a kind Invitation to dine with him, where we met with about 12 or 15 Sachems & head Warriors of the six Nations & other Indian Tribes, after Dinner Pipes & Tobacco were brought on the Table, and after some pleasant Conversation, I requested Jasper Parrish and Interpreter to inform the Chiefs that I wished them to open their Ears; that I had something to say to them, which he did & they gave solid Attention,  I thought proper to inform, that we were \nIndians informed who we are\nof the Society of peaceable People call'd Quakers from Philadelphia, and

       out of Curiosity, which had such a deadning Tendency that I thought\n                             made hard work for him, after he closed, they sang a hymn or something\n

Brothers, we therefore ask you, are you fully authorized by the United States, to continue and firmly fix on the Ohio River as the boundary line, between your people and ours.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":68427,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/68427","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b3694cf889fd177fa4081a93fcc99dce.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b3694cf889fd177fa4081a93fcc99dce.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b3694cf889fd177fa4081a93fcc99dce.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b3694cf889fd177fa4081a93fcc99dce.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-28T15:08:12+00:00","modified":"2020-10-19T04:05:57+00:00","filename":"b3694cf889fd177fa4081a93fcc99dce.jpg","authentication":"1dfcd0b5327daa726bc67c00d76b8ee8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":77,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3146_00041_o2 copy.jpg","size":1108908,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":3031,"compression_ratio":0.067751017266029},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["122900+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["122900+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["122900+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b3694cf889fd177fa4081a93fcc99dce.jpg","FileDateTime":1522249615,"FileSize":1108908,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"3031\"","Height":3031,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":3031,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:27 16:40:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":814,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5649},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:27 12:29:00","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:27 12:29:00","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":63,"SubSecTimeDigitized":63,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":3031,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":1026,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1026","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Brothers, the deputies here present, we have now repeated the words contained in that paper, which you delivered to us, we presume the interpretation agrees with your ideas of the contents of the paper, it is expressed to be signed by the Wyondols, Delaniares, Shanenees, Miamies, Mingoes, Potowatimies, Ottawas, Connays, Chippewas and Mundes, in behalf of themselves and the whole confederacy, and agreed to in a full council.

Brothers, peace having thus been made between the King of Great Britain and the United States, it remained to make peace between them and the Indian Nations, who had taken part with the King, for this purpose commissioners were appointed, who sent messages to to all those Indian Nations, inviting them to come and make peace, the first treaty was held about nine years ago, with the six nations at Fort Hamwise, which has stood firm and unviolated to this day, the next treaty was made about ninety days after at Fort M.

Brothers, you seem to consider all the lands in dispute on your side of the Ohio, as claimed by the United States, but suffer us to remind you, that a large tract was sold by the Wyondols and Delaware nations to the state of Pennsylvania, this tract lies east of a line drawn from the mouth of Beevers creek at the Ohio, due north","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":68431,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/68431","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/9e757fc3550fc268926e616f9cb6ab28.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/9e757fc3550fc268926e616f9cb6ab28.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/9e757fc3550fc268926e616f9cb6ab28.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9e757fc3550fc268926e616f9cb6ab28.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-28T15:08:16+00:00","modified":"2020-09-03T21:58:43+00:00","filename":"9e757fc3550fc268926e616f9cb6ab28.jpg","authentication":"2953d4fe283d7db7e136ca430ca00dec","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":81,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3146_00043_o2 copy.jpg","size":1157028,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":3042,"compression_ratio":0.070435386076412},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["122940+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["122940+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["122940+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"9e757fc3550fc268926e616f9cb6ab28.jpg","FileDateTime":1522249615,"FileSize":1157028,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"3042\"","Height":3042,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":3042,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:27 16:40:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":814,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6048},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:27 12:29:40","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:27 12:29:40","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":31,"SubSecTimeDigitized":31,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":3042,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":1026,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1026","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"north to Lake Erie, this line is the western boundary of Pennsylvania as claimed under the charter given by the King of England to your antient friend William Penn, of this sale made by the Wyondol and Delaware Nations to the state of Pennsylvania, we have never heard any complaint.

but had left them and shaked the dust off her feet as a testimony against friends of the meeting she came from, she denied that she ever belong'd","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":68450,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/68450","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/75b7f5d8656b2076eafb8991df2fdfb1.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/75b7f5d8656b2076eafb8991df2fdfb1.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/75b7f5d8656b2076eafb8991df2fdfb1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/75b7f5d8656b2076eafb8991df2fdfb1.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-28T15:08:34+00:00","modified":"2020-09-03T21:58:43+00:00","filename":"75b7f5d8656b2076eafb8991df2fdfb1.jpg","authentication":"05a8f74ab7976f44698ec5d4e4bf5146","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":100,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3146_00052_o2.jpg","size":1147587,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":3059,"compression_ratio":0.069472412916349},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["123758+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["123758+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["123758+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"75b7f5d8656b2076eafb8991df2fdfb1.jpg","FileDateTime":1522249616,"FileSize":1147587,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"3059\"","Height":3059,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":3059,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:27 16:41:03","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":814,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5809},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:27 12:37:58","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:27 12:37:58","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"SubSecTimeDigitized":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":3059,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":1026,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1026","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"belonged, but said she had gone to our meetings and other places, signifying to declare the word of the Lord, told her she could not be insensible that there had been strange reports of her, and as the Apostle said we should give an account of the hope within us, and as it was not not always best to take things by hearsay, I asked her if she had refused to be called by the name her parents had given her, I also informed her that it had been said she was displeased in being called a woman, which if false I should be glad should be glad to have it in my power to contradict the report;

Conference with unclear Indians about Hopewell\nBigtree & several other Indians called at our Lodgeings, being seated, bigtree mentioned that when they were at new york, some time past, some friends requested they would make enquiry who were the Original owners of the Land about Hopewell in Virginia -- They said it appear'd to them that those persons were incorporated with the six Nations, and therefore any presents that might be given would be best applied to be distributed among them at large -- It appears to be the united sense of friends now attending the Treaty, that the mode of distribution as above proposed will be the most eligible in the present situation of things; This day I received for the first time some intelligence from home, by my Brother Isaac & Daughter Sally, the most of which was agreeable","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":68466,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/68466","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/22183c9577b1ca64cff69917e48fb3a5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/22183c9577b1ca64cff69917e48fb3a5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/22183c9577b1ca64cff69917e48fb3a5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/22183c9577b1ca64cff69917e48fb3a5.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-28T15:08:49+00:00","modified":"2020-09-03T21:58:43+00:00","filename":"22183c9577b1ca64cff69917e48fb3a5.jpg","authentication":"6e5163093a44b2245abe102b47119c60","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":116,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3146_00060_o2.jpg","size":1142878,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":3028,"compression_ratio":0.069895665149958},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["124609+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["124609+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["124609+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"22183c9577b1ca64cff69917e48fb3a5.jpg","FileDateTime":1522249616,"FileSize":1142878,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"3028\"","Height":3028,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":3028,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:27 16:41:11","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":814,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5826},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:27 12:46:09","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:27 12:46:09","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":55,"SubSecTimeDigitized":55,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":3028,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":1026,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1026","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1794 WD\n11mo:4.3         No public business transacted to day.\n\n         5.4         The Council being assembled, Redjacket address'd the Cm. Brother, Now we are conversing together in order to make the Chain bright, when we told you what would give satisfaction, you proposed reserving of this piece between Buffalo Creek & John's Landing, for building houses, &, but we apprehend you would not only build houses but towns, you told us these houses would be to accommodate travellers in Winter, as they cannot go by water in that season, and that the travellers would want a staff in travelling that road, we have taken these matters into Consideration, we conclude we do not understand this as the white People do, if we consent, we know it will injure us, if these houses should be built, they would lend to scatter us, & make us fall in the Streets, alluding to rum instead of benefiting us, you want places to raise provisions, hay &, but as soon as they settle, then they would think the land theirs, for this is the way of the white People, you mention when you get Possession of that Country, you would want landing Places, Hores fields to plant in, &, but we wish to be the sole owners of this land ourselves, you requested a road, but when you settle with the Brittish, you can pass & repass by water, as the great Spirit has made that road, we have made up our minds, we wish to be the sole owners of the Land, what you want to reserve is entirely in your own favour, you told us when you left Phila, it was not expected by the United States, you would release a foot of land, we thank them in having left you at liberty, to give up what you please, you have waited with patience at this Council fire kindled by general Washington, it is but a very small thing that keeps the chain from being brightned, if you will consent to give up this small piece, & have no houses on it, the Chain will be made bright, as to harbours, the water is between you & the Brittish, you must talk to them, of the same Colour, I see there are many of yor people now here, waiting with their

Astonished at what we had heard at every quarter, with hearts aching with compassion for our women and children, we were thus compelled to give up all our country north of the line of Pennsylvania, and east of the Gennesee River up to the great fork, and east of a south line drawn up from that fork to the line of Pennsylvania. For this land P-- agreed to pay us ten thousand dollars in hand, and one thousand dollars a year for ever. He paid us two thousand five hundred dollars, and he sent for us to come last spring and receive new money; but instead of paying us the remainder of the ten thousand dollars, and the one thousand dollars due for the first year he offered only five hundred dollars, and insisted that he had agreed with us for that sum to be had yearly. We debated with him for six days, during all which time he persisted in refusing to pay us our just demand; and he insisted that we should receive the five hundred dollars; and Sheet from Niagara also insisted on our receiving the money, as it was offered to us.

Father, Our writings were lodged in the Lands of S. of Niagara as we suppose him to be our friend; but we saw P. consulting S. on every occasion, we doubted of his honesty towards us; and we have since heard that he was to receive for his endeavors to deceive us, a piece of land ten miles in width, west of the Gennesee River, and nearly forty miles in length, extending to Lake Ontario; and the lines of this tract have been run accordingly, altho' no part of it is within the bounds which limit his purchase. Father, you have said we were in your hand, and that by closing it, you could crush us to nothing.

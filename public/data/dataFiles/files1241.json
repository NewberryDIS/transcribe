He cannot use his eyes five minutes without injury, and says he feels as if he should tumble to pieces for weakness.\nEver so much love to you from your affectionate daughter\nNettie.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98638,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/98638","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/724d2c484219a17b66f7fb6d5d8bbcab.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/724d2c484219a17b66f7fb6d5d8bbcab.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/724d2c484219a17b66f7fb6d5d8bbcab.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/724d2c484219a17b66f7fb6d5d8bbcab.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T19:12:39+00:00","modified":"2020-06-17T23:43:47+00:00","filename":"724d2c484219a17b66f7fb6d5d8bbcab.jpg","authentication":"c842edd2fcf191639c2812b6299dcb0f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_109_008_001_o2.jpg","size":1036319,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2289,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041920254680194},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["232318"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["232318"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["232318"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"724d2c484219a17b66f7fb6d5d8bbcab.jpg","FileDateTime":1587323453,"FileSize":1036319,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2289\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2289,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:57:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:12 23:23:18","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:12 23:23:18","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":47,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2257,"ExifImageLength":3549,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1241,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1241","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Nettie     Dunbarton\nAug. 12, 1860\nDunbarton, Aug. 12,1860\nMy own dearest.-\nThis is Sabbath evening and I wonder how you and the dear little ones do and all the rest.

Albina's chief news is that Mr. Severance's dog had run mad and been killed, but before he met his fate he bit a number of dogs in the region, and Rover among the rest.  Rover had forthwith been killed also as the safest course.  Charlie feels quite bad about it.  Sarah Burgess had reached Dunbarton.  Mother thinks her very slow, but I guess she will do well.  George reached home safely.

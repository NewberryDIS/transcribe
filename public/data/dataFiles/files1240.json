Text - Col. 2:10. \"And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power\". Theme - Those who receive Christ - will have their highest wants supplied. Consider man's wants. Consider the fact that those who receive Christ will have every want completely supplied. Man's wants. 1. He wants saving knowledge. Man has knowledge by which he can make the rivers his road, and the ocean his highway. He can measure the distance to the sun and the starts, and make the lightenings of heaven do his bidding. He can weigh the hills in scales and the mountains in a balance. He possesses powers and faculties which fit him to be a companion of angels, and yet he needs that knowledge which will save the soul. All else is vain. 2. Man needs justifying righteousness. No one can obtain this by his own merits. 3. He needs the aids of the Holy Spirit. 4. He needs an Almighty Friend, to protect him against the evils which encompass him. 5. Man wants a home in Heaven. He know how dear is an earthly home and how we pity the poor wanderer who has no home. No home in all this wide, unfriendly world! Well may we love our earthly home; but we need a home beyond the skies, when the turmoil of life shall be past. Consider the fact, that those who receive Christ, will have every want completely supplied. Do we need saving knowledge? Christ can impart it. He is the medium of communication between God and fallen man. The word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Do we need justifying righteousness? Christ is the end of the law to everyone that believeth. Do we need the aids of the Holy Spirit? Christ has promised his followers that he will send them the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost. Do we need an Almighty friend? Christ is such. He has all power in Heaven and on earth; and he has said he will never leave nor forsake those who trust in him. Do we need a home in heaven? Christ will provide us this. He says, \"In my Father's house are many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you\".

We have a stated meeting of this kind every month, at which familiar remarks are made upon whatever had occurred of interest pertaining to Freedom, during the month just expired.  I always enjoy them much.  The visit of Kossuth, and the bearing it is likely to have upon the cause of Liberty, are the grand themes for discussion at present.

I have been thinking a long while and now will write a little. When I wrote last, I was waiting to hear from you, and feared a letter might have been lost, but in process of time, it has come and was truly welcome.  \nIt seems you were having, in March, the weather of New England May.  I should like to view the prospect from your window; indeed I should enjoy viewing anything that seems spring-like.  We are almost tired of waiting for the snow to be gone.  Winter still holds undisputed sway, and the warm winds linger in the sunny south.  Last Monday, father stood upon a snow bank nearly six feet high and measured a giant icicle pendant from the eaves of the house.  It was thirty one inches long, and five and one half inches round at the largest end. Another, eighteen inches long, lay on the bank.  This was the afternoon, too, after it had been thawing some all day.  The next day we had a severe snow storm.\nI must tell you about some apples Jenny saved for you.  They were beautiful great ones and were waiting down cellar for you to come.  In excellent health they were all winter long, blushing every time I looked upon them. And seeming in a fever of expectation till first of March passed.  Then, not being so stouthearted as I, they could endure no longer, but began visibly to decline and you may guess their fate - poor things!","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98475,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/98475","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b17367289cccb3df47ae8f4beeeb4a56.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b17367289cccb3df47ae8f4beeeb4a56.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b17367289cccb3df47ae8f4beeeb4a56.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b17367289cccb3df47ae8f4beeeb4a56.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T18:47:57+00:00","modified":"2020-06-12T16:48:47+00:00","filename":"b17367289cccb3df47ae8f4beeeb4a56.jpg","authentication":"a8a2ee414bf2531a192469e49f1ca0a3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_105_011_002_o2.jpg","size":1370214,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2758,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046001329465796},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230307"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230307"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230307"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b17367289cccb3df47ae8f4beeeb4a56.jpg","FileDateTime":1587322012,"FileSize":1370214,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2758\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2758,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:51:05","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:12 23:03:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:12 23:03:07","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":47,"SubSecTimeOriginal":25,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2907,"ExifImageLength":3794,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1240,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1240","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I was exceedingly interested in what you relate of your experience regarding Methodism, and the Methodists.

I have been reading a description of Mammouth Cave, written by Mr. Charles Tenney, once my teacher, at Gilmanton Academy. He spent some months, last Autumn, in journeying South and West. The sense of the beautiful and the sublime is really oppressive when reading a highly wrought description of the marvels of that Subterranean world.

It is time I stopped writing. I was just thinking you might possibly be making preparations for a journey East, about this time, because your last letter said you might be able to get away a month.

To the pastor's study they come and open a whole budget of greivances to find redress; or unfold their takes of whatever distresses or pleases them, expecting advice or sympathy as the case may demand, and seeming, in their turn, to deem all that pertains to the welfare of their pastor and his family, as their common property. This manifestation of  interest in our well being it is pleasant to perceive, though sometimes we feel as if it would be quite as comfortable not to be quite so public characters. The good matrons here, some of the gray-headed ones too, seem to feel about as much interest in my affairs and prospects as if I were their child;  and I feel somewhat of the same confidence in them that I do in my own dear parents.

It closes the last week in June at any rate - only eight weeks long. Now I hope this will\n\n[left-hand side and top]  I hope you will excuse this careless letter, for I have written hurriedly. You think I must agree that you write often. Your letters are worth a great deal to me and never come too often. Do not fear writing too many if you have time to spend so. Most truly yours, Antoinette.  I shall look for you a little this week and shall be most happy if you come.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98483,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/98483","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d170f482cca72cdff07d461f84710379.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d170f482cca72cdff07d461f84710379.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d170f482cca72cdff07d461f84710379.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d170f482cca72cdff07d461f84710379.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T18:48:08+00:00","modified":"2020-07-18T02:04:05+00:00","filename":"d170f482cca72cdff07d461f84710379.jpg","authentication":"05f1486e33a21748dd8c1d9f8958c939","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_105_013_002_o2.jpg","size":1409573,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2714,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048089911023772},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230352"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230352"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230352"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d170f482cca72cdff07d461f84710379.jpg","FileDateTime":1587322013,"FileSize":1409573,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2714\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2714,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:51:22","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:12 23:03:52","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:12 23:03:52","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":47,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2871,"ExifImageLength":3808,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1240,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1240","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"not trouble you.

She had been a long time sick. The other was a young lady just 20 years old - a beautiful girl sick 12 weeks. A few weeks ago, she expressed hope in Christ: An interesting and promising young man, who bride she was to have been, called to day to talk with father. He had also indulged hope within a short time - some three months. But the clock has just struck twelve times, and I must not write longer. Good night.\n\n   Here comes Monday morning.

We stopped to dinner at Bradford.  What a miserable hotel! Lucy says it grows worse & worse every time she stops there. Had pleasant ride, not very warm, got there about five, started at nine in morning. All glad to see us. I do not see as mother grows old. Albina looks nicely. Charlie & Josie a few inches higher up. What a decided character little Mary is. Mother says when she takes Mayo and looks in his face- I can hardly believe it is Isaac's baby.\n\n  Thursday June 15 . Went to Brownville - delightful ride by Pleasant River- called at Mr. Sewall's a few moments- reached Brownville about noon- found all well. Mayo was full of frolic as could be. Mr. Rider seemed to enjoy playing with him and laughing at him very much. He played so long after undressing that he felt cold after it I expect for he cried very hard a little while. He took four or five steps all alone today. Mother said he would soon go alone, and that she had no expectations of seeing, physically, in little Mayo so strong and healthy a child. She thought he would be puny.\n  Friday June 16. went back to Milo in the P.M.

Samuel & Lucy & mother went to the village to make calls & took tea at Albina's father's. I read to Josie some in the little book I carried here. I carried \"Life of Bunyan\" to Albina.\n  Sabbath June 18. Mother, Lucy & Percie with little Mary & Sally's baby, self & baby remained at home - rest went to church and heard a Mr. Smith preach annihilation to the wicked. None of them enjoyed the preaching. Went home - were all busy enough with babies.\n\nMonday June 19. Came back to Bangor - Sabra and all in the carriage. We stopped at noon at a private house where they sometimes put up people and had a most Excellent dinner - all clean and neat etc. Some tired at night. Samuel & I picked some checkerberry leaves to bring home to Mallie. A letter from you came also a letter from Dunbarton the first received since we were there. Father and mother had been to a ministers Convention at Concord and were detained in that way from writing, the letter, beside, was not put in the box so I did not get it as soon as otherwise. They were all well as usual, George at Pembroke, father to get a school for him next winter. I do wish he could do something besides keep school. They seem anxious to see me and yet willing I should do as is the best. I hardly know whether it is best for me to wait for Anne. I can not then be home before last week in July.

Now I should not admire that mustache or anybody else, and I like your face just as well without it, but am amazing glad you concluded to make an exhibition of the present condition of your countenance now I know how you are looking now. I have looked at that face so long tonight that it seems to stand out from the plate a living form, and so strange that it speaks not nor moves. O how it makes me long to see your very self.

Now the little boy is playing with kitty running all about the floor, and trying to talk, so I take the time to write while he does not need me. I have been at meeting all day - mother went last sabbath. We had not a very full house for it rained very steadily all day long - moistening the glad earth and replenishing the exhausted springs. Last Tuesday came your long letters telling me about the sad accident. The next morning with my bonnet on ready for a ride to Concord, I scribbled a note to you to take with me and mail at C. Yesterday came yours of Nov. 7 mailed at St. Louis, and a good one from sister Mallie. They are enjoying housekeeping much- both her sisters probably to be there this winter. She said my Isaac wrote her \"some beautiful lines in a letter to Eliab\". She says, \"how I do like Isaac.\" Mallie is a dear, kind sister and excellent wife, I think. - and that little Percie is getting fat and healthy again. Is'nt it good? And all that exposure and labor & loss of sleep has not made you sick! I do think it is wonderful. How can I help saying \"My cup runneth over\" when I think of that accident and of your safety. It makes me feel as though you surely would be kept; and we shall meet again to be thankful and happy together. Is Mitchell getting well? How good that he too was so little injured\n\n[left-hand side] I do not think I had better get a cloak now this winter. You know that large warm cape like my brown Thibet dress. That will answer every purpose. Almost every one wears furs - round neck and wrists tipped, and I do not know what else they style thus  -- but I have a muff and that is enough I think. I like you to have you tell me about dress, for I like your taste.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98509,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/98509","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/af4fa2813798e32b6b54cdf094052533.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/af4fa2813798e32b6b54cdf094052533.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/af4fa2813798e32b6b54cdf094052533.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/af4fa2813798e32b6b54cdf094052533.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T18:48:42+00:00","modified":"2020-07-18T21:18:44+00:00","filename":"af4fa2813798e32b6b54cdf094052533.jpg","authentication":"f9ffb810847f7cae7b52b68752bcadba","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_106_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1674031,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2805,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.055259490328118},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230715"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230715"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230715"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"af4fa2813798e32b6b54cdf094052533.jpg","FileDateTime":1587322014,"FileSize":1674031,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2805\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2805,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"22mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:52:25","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:12 23:07:15","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:12 23:07:15","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":47,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3670,"ExifImageLength":4710,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1240,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1240","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I am glad too it happened by no carelessness of any of your men.

I do not care a bit how soon it is all done. But I shall not look for you till Jan. lest I be disappointed.\n  I wonder what Mistress Keyes thinks of going to the station to live? I expect I ought to send my love to her. Won't you give some to her next time you call. You know she really was very kind indeed to me when I was sick in June. How much she did for little Mayo - and I cannot help remembering it. I don't think the woman is as good as she might be, and who is? \"Give every one his due and who would 'scape whipping\"?  George goes tomorrow to the Institute - it lasts ten days. I hope to go down some.\n\n[left-hand side upside down] My bonnet is a black velvet - a very rich piece with garnet & white flowers inside.

And yet she is kind & good hearted, I imagine.\n    Your second letter gladdened me yesterday - dated Lewistown, Pen.. How would I delight to see the mountains with you - how grand it must be. I want to know the story of the Alleghanies - you are beyond them by this time mayhap. I have written two letters to Elyria. Last one mailed Monday. We had a letter from Anna Monday.

chance to get likenesses here times are somewhat dull Dec 25th since writing the above we have passed through another Christmas and a very uncommon one almost as warm as summer and such a thunderstorm I have not seen for many a day it rained and blowed thundered and lightened Mac Eugean and myself were out in it comeing from Neivels I thought at one time we would not get home but we did the rain fell so fast the road was full of water like a heavy shower in summer it drove against us until it seemed as if it almost took our breath the wind was in the north which made it seem cold during the storm.I was up to Frosts last week they had just got a letter form John H he tells them such fine takes about California that they are almost in the notion of going there in the spring he wrote for Mary to come out in the spring if a train goes out and Henry Miner and wife

So we had a talk about Warwick matters seeing played and had a nice time generally. Jennie is going to visit round here some time. She is now at Dedham - Wednesday night we rode back to Waltham You've been there so I shall not need to describe it to you - Found Mr. Randall, Lizzie, Byron, & Ada at home and glad to see us - Abby Dix and her beau and another gentleman Mr Fisk came in the evening - and we had a very pleasant time indeed. And made a long evening of it, sat up till after twelve and finished up with espe'y good vesper tune \"Lord dismiss us with thy blessing \", We ntended starting for home Thursday Morning, but it rained, so we staid till Friday - Mr. Randall staid at home too - did'nt go into Boston And Ada remained at home from from school to play with Eva. So, we had another nice time. In the evening the little ones came for their share of a good time, so we all joined in \"Blind - Man's - Buff\" - and had a regular frolic and then followed the game of Commanders and guessing, Puzzles &c. The next morning after breakfast we all  joined in, \"Home sweet Home\", and then said \"good-bye\". and started for home quite invigorated with out pleasant visits. They told us Mary Russell had nearly as quite recovered from her attack of insanity, is at home and apparantly well. Sunday we went to our church in the Morning and to the Sabbath School, and then rode over to Mr Bassetts. They have a Spiritual meeting in Berlin once in two weeks and Rhoda wanted to go so we rode over. I staid at Mr. Bassetts.

She gets quite and idea of numbers from her Tivoli boards. I have drawn a pattern of one for you and also of Fox & Geese and Morris.

But as to writing, I can't endorse your proposition of writing \"two or three letters to your one\" al all. Because you must reasonably conclude that I want to hear from you as often as you from me.

These repairs of course hindered our getting settled, but we got a few rooms fixed so we could live here, and then did the rest by degrees, having had to have our furniture repainted, stained and varnished, a good deal of it, in account of the damages.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":41937,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/41937","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/2988cb5c67831abf7fd205f320420b7d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/2988cb5c67831abf7fd205f320420b7d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/2988cb5c67831abf7fd205f320420b7d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2988cb5c67831abf7fd205f320420b7d.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T20:22:33+00:00","modified":"2020-05-20T04:36:41+00:00","filename":"2988cb5c67831abf7fd205f320420b7d.jpg","authentication":"8b53482a0cddc7597f69d05642de0e4c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_064_005_004_o2.jpg","size":1081361,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2333,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042917281833913},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170802"],"TimeCreated":["031712"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170802"],"TimeCreated":["031712"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170802"],"TimeCreated":["031712"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"2988cb5c67831abf7fd205f320420b7d.jpg","FileDateTime":1509394637,"FileSize":1081361,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2333\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2333,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"16mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:03 09:57:13","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:02 03:17:12","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:02 03:17:12","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":49,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2571,"ExifImageLength":3966,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":181,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/181","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"So you see I've scarcely had time to wink, since I got here and then right square in the midst of it, Little Mary had a scrofulous swelling on her throat, it was very painful I suppose, and made her just about sick.

I know how hard it was for you to part with your little Charlie, but this new sorrow, and Mr. Kendall, not here to help you bear it, or talk it over with, oh! dear.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":41953,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/41953","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/faa8cf95744714af1d9496420fbbed91.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/faa8cf95744714af1d9496420fbbed91.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/faa8cf95744714af1d9496420fbbed91.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/faa8cf95744714af1d9496420fbbed91.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T20:23:11+00:00","modified":"2020-01-21T20:59:46+00:00","filename":"faa8cf95744714af1d9496420fbbed91.jpg","authentication":"e4d62eedb346ef8bf80ea048c9fe2a17","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_064_008_002_o2.jpg","size":1010695,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2284,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040973235713822},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170802"],"TimeCreated":["031917"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170802"],"TimeCreated":["031917"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170802"],"TimeCreated":["031917"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"faa8cf95744714af1d9496420fbbed91.jpg","FileDateTime":1509394637,"FileSize":1010695,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2284\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2284,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:03 09:57:51","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:02 03:19:17","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:02 03:19:17","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2551,"ExifImageLength":4020,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":181,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/181","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"and I suppose the children can hardly realize anything about it only to know they miss him and can't see him ever any more.

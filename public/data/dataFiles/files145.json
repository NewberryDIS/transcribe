We never again felt as much concern for the actions of the future year as we do this year, because the financial turmoil has so affected the whole country, and as many of our recipients are suffering, as is likely , from this hardship and confusion.\n\n  We do not know what is appropriate to say. But I would like to be able to persuade everyone who receives it now not to give it up next year again. There is hope that things will improve soon, and there are already some improvements in some considerations and in places, \u2014and we promise to remain with our recipients for the 1858 payments until at some point in the body of the as convenient to them. We hope that an effort will be made soon to pay what is due for 1857, as we are in desperate need.\n   We would be grateful to you, dear friend, for your help and co-operation in efforts to keep the list of current recipients without diminishing. Also, as those in places may be pulling back, make an effort, if possible, to get some news recipients. Nothing can be returned from our roof, to make it worthy of our nation's acceptance and approval. It continues to be issued in the same fold, at the current price of $ 1,50 a year, and we continue to strive for its supply and good things. We are you humbly in the service of our nation,\n ROBERT EVERETT.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":34033,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/34033","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3b65328c9fb3f49a5fe2a50422ff7ea2.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3b65328c9fb3f49a5fe2a50422ff7ea2.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3b65328c9fb3f49a5fe2a50422ff7ea2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3b65328c9fb3f49a5fe2a50422ff7ea2.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T14:41:25+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:56:48+00:00","filename":"3b65328c9fb3f49a5fe2a50422ff7ea2.jpg","authentication":"54c60da9740c4dd81f50d8adc812232b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_02_fl_091_001_04_o2.jpg","size":1066397,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

afternoon\nDearest Jennie:\n\n Mother was unable to finish this this morning in time to send with Mr K. to the village. She has now gone to see G. Maurice\u2019s wife, who is very low indeed, with the consumption I think, and (mother, not Mrs. Maurice) wished me to write a little and send it down with John. It is now five o\u2019clock , and I have but a few minutes as it is most time for supper. Went with father to meeting this afternoon, had a very good meeting though there were very few there.  We were very glad to hear that you had at last obtained a place to teach, though it is probably uncertain how long you may continue in that school . We are glad too that it is not in the primary department, as you will like it better. How are you pleased, and how do you succeed? I hope indeed my dear sister that some field of usefulness may soon open in which your soul may take delight. Sarah says she wishes you would satisfy her curiosity by seting? what you want this hair for, which she sends, a good bunch of it. She would write more now if it were not so late and she is quite tired, besides having a un?comfortable degree of toothache. We had a very pleasant visit from Mr.. R. s family. We are glad to hear that Robert is doing so well. write again soon and tell us how you get along about boarding &c. I must close it is so dark I could not see the lines if I had one.

Indeed, it is best not to be very anxious about any thing, but to be easy, calm, doing present duty, and trusting in the Lord.

Henry and your Mother reached home about half past Nine o'clock Tuesday Night. Gwen Prichard, wanted them to come home very much Day. The Old Mare drew, and I, drove up to Glyn, Wednesday Morning. She sent Sarah Your pumpkins. And told me to tell John, after she got home, that he was welcome to the Pumpkin Pie. She told me to tell Sarah, to get well as soon as she could, and hurry to come up there as soon as she could. That She would fix up the New House like Palace for her. they had just got through painting it that Day. Old Mr Prichard, Gwen's Father was the Painter. It is painted Red out side and the corners and Cornice White. The Roof is unpainted. Lewis & Margaret have moved, to Humphrey Robert's New House by Mary, Catharine & Laura Thomas's Sarah about the same. Dr Guiteau was here last Tuesday. He said, that she did not expect her to recover soon, seeing that she could 'nt bear strong Medicine. We received your Letter Night before last. Henry found a letter for him the Night he came home, from June it came Monday Evening. William I.

He told John, that he did not want charge such Postage. This makes your Fathers postage 8 or 10 dollars more every year.

But all is well and we want to be more thankful for this and all other mercies and blessings. You will rejoice with us to hear that Robert has recovered so well. He needs strength is feeble - otherwise we may say he is well. We had us letter from John last week. I do not know what to say about the state of things in Kansas. The attack upon Lawrence was a most daring villainous act, But I hope it has awakened the country to such a pitch that some check will be given to the mad carrier of those dangerous wretches. I have my fears that the free state cause in Kansas will be crushed entirely that many will be discouraged and return others hindered from going from the free states seeing the lives as well as the property of freemen an in continual peril. And doubtless this is the object of the Border Ruffians they want to accomplish by mob violence what they cannot by reason and argument, and as long as they are encouraged by the administration as they have been there is reason to fear they will succeed. But still, I cannot otherwise than hope that affairs will take a different shape after a while. The action of the Cincinnati Convention which opens today, will tell something If Pierce is not nominated, his aim at pleasing the Slavery party will not be quite so daring as it has been.

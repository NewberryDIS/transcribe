I will not repeat what I wrote in Rogers letter as he will show the same to you. I have backing enough to hold this position for a lifetime under a republican administrator, but if I hold on now it must be through Democratic influence. Do you know any influential Democrat who would suggest by letter or in person to the Commission that I be retained. I wrote to Josiah in regard to my claims for consideration viz. that during a long term of service (since Dec 12\/78) I have worked faithfully for the best interests of the service, that I have never for a day favored myself in the slightest degree. Others have rested the Agmt? and Physician minor employees have frequently taken leaves of absence. But I never have and when the two persons mentioned were away I cheerfully performed their duties altho such action compelled me to labor many hours after the other employees were asleep. It is only by almost constant work Sundays and late at night that I have been able to perform.

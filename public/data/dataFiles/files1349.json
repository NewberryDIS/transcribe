Mitchell Esq.\nSir,\nAltho you do not state particularly in you letter of the 2d inst.  that the Africans detained by you had been brought within the jurisdictional limits of the State of Georgia, yet I take it for granted that you are under the impression that such is the fact. The act of Congress to which you have reference provides that in all cases  the Negroes Seized shall be delivered over to the State Authority to be dealt with according to the provisions of the Laws of such State. Now if the Negroes in question were first brought into this State, the effect of the act of Congress would be in my opinion, to divest the original owners of any right or title which they may have had, and at once gave to the State a right to the possession of the Negroes. Until recently as you know, there was no act of this State in relation to property of this description which could be carried into effect.

Aug. 1820.\nDear Sir:\nIn some conversation which I had the other day with Major Crawford I was led to hope that you intended visiting this part of the state before you went to Lexington, but I now learn that if such was your intention, it is now changed, and you have gone to Oglethorpe. it has also been mentioned that you intended visiting several of the counties between the Oconee? and unclear. This has caused so much uncertainty of the place where you are to be found upon any given day, that I am at some loss where or when I can see you. I think Major Crawford mentioned that it was certain you would visit Jones county at or about the time of the Sitting of the Superior Court in Clinton. if this be your determination I should certainly meet you there, or expect you to come","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":113400,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/113400","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/9118dd4de1f5b826b326fa39de3bac6a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/9118dd4de1f5b826b326fa39de3bac6a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/9118dd4de1f5b826b326fa39de3bac6a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9118dd4de1f5b826b326fa39de3bac6a.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-18T03:25:11+00:00","modified":"2020-12-30T11:05:34+00:00","filename":"9118dd4de1f5b826b326fa39de3bac6a.jpg","authentication":"d5d449c0e069e41d90b0b1dbf1455154","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"ruggles_506_07_02_o2.jpg","size":1358990,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2907,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.043286001860133},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180320"],"TimeCreated":["001909"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["New Aguisitions"],"Credit":["959383"],"Source":["VAULT Ruggles 506"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180320"],"TimeCreated":["001909"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["New Aguisitions"],"Credit":["959383"],"Source":["VAULT Ruggles 506"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180320"],"TimeCreated":["001909"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["New Aguisitions"],"Credit":["959383"],"Source":["VAULT Ruggles 506"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"9118dd4de1f5b826b326fa39de3bac6a.jpg","FileDateTime":1605669868,"FileSize":1358990,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2907\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2907,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"16mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:20 11:44:36","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:03:20 00:19:09","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:03:20 00:19:09","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2694,"ExifImageLength":3336,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1349,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1349","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"or go by my house, where I shall hope to induce you to spend a few days.\nI declined answering your last letter until I should have sent to the war department the Evidence in the Case of the Africans, because, I saw by the contents of your letter that you were impatient, and under unclear which would be removed by a knowledge of facts.

Sims the former Clerk of the Superior Court of Hancock County, appears to be under some difficulty in consequence of the recording business of his office, and the minutes, not being brought up, at the time he was succeeded in that office, by the present incumbent. The difficulty does not occur from any unwillingness on the part of M. Sims to perform the work, but, as I understand the matter, from a doubt in the minds of some, whether the Inferior Court of the County may not order the labor to be performed by some other person at the expense of M. Sims. was M. Sims dead, did his representatives refuse to have the work done, then indeed there might be some reason for the opinion that the Inferior Court might interfere in the matter; but, can the Inferior Court take cognizance of the neglect or default of a clerk of the Superior Court whilst in office, or is he not exclusively subject to the order of the Judge of that Court?

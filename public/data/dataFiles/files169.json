I dislike this weather, you asked me\nleft-hand side relative to our boarding for a time after our marriage, I think perhaps it will be best for us to do so, as I do not want to board many months however I can't make arrangements I think for us to beard here. I now board. I want to have a home sooner however for I do enjoy having a home that I can call my own. It will be best I think for us to board till about the 1st of September if this will suit you. I will make arrangements accordingly. Affectionately, N.

March 23rd 1857\nMy dear good Abby,\nI was very much disappointed in not getting a letter from you before I left home.  The date of the last one I received was March 1st.  I must think that you have written & that your letter has been miscarried.  When I return home I am sure I shall find a good long letter from you.  Yesterday P.M. I left LaPorte & went to Plymouth.  Night before last they had a terrible fire in Plymouth burning up the whole business part of the town.  I think there are but two stores remaining.  It will ruin many young men who have got together a few thousand dollars & were in business.  To day I have rode about 400 miles.  I have just had a good supper.  It is about 10 in the evening.  I expect to get through my business so as to leave here to-morrow evening.  In which case I shall ride all night to-morrow night.

I wish you could have heard his sermon as well as the sermon of Beacher which I heard this morning. I believe I liked Beacher the best to day. But the sermons were both excellent.

I have much anxiety & excitement lately. But I feel better now I know the worst. David & I get along well. But you know Everhart was an endorser on Rose's paper for some 12000 dollars & that judgement had been obtained against him. Now you know judgements hold all real estate a man has. He owns 1\/3 of the Mill, & of course the judgement covers that 1\/3 but he owned as we supposed some 20 or 30 thousand dollars of other property which would more than pay the judgement so we were easy, but it turns out now that Everhart put his farm worth 20000 dollars out of his hands before that judgement was obtained, hence there is danger that we may lose 2 or 3 thousand dollars by this","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":39646,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/39646","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c70b2810c7e031fafffdebb5df3cfcd7.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c70b2810c7e031fafffdebb5df3cfcd7.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c70b2810c7e031fafffdebb5df3cfcd7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c70b2810c7e031fafffdebb5df3cfcd7.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-26T17:26:26+00:00","modified":"2020-05-13T15:59:01+00:00","filename":"c70b2810c7e031fafffdebb5df3cfcd7.jpg","authentication":"266f7fd10a54941ed685fa4e029717e2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_01_fl_12_003_03_o2.jpg","size":1259695,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2304,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050624316808128},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170711"],"TimeCreated":["020548"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170711"],"TimeCreated":["020548"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170711"],"TimeCreated":["020548"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c70b2810c7e031fafffdebb5df3cfcd7.jpg","FileDateTime":1509038370,"FileSize":1259695,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2304\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2304,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/6.3"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:11 14:21:13","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":6.3,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:11 02:05:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:11 02:05:48","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.310704,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":37,"SubSecTimeOriginal":34,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2733,"ExifImageLength":4269,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":169,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/169","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"matter.

I spent last night in Greenfield. I left Greenfield about 5 this P.M. I would like very much to hear from you & dear Eddie. I have written a long letter to-night to David relative to our business matters. I wish you would write me directing to care of American House Boston so that I can get in Saturday letting me know how you are & how Eddie is, also if any letters have come from La Porte for me open them & write me what of importance they contain. Dear Little Eddie how much I love him & his good Mama. His sweet little voice rings almost constantly in my ears. I wish it wee reality. Remember me kindly to Mother, Mary & all the rest. Affectionately\n\nYour husband N.

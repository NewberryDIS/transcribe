The true christian loves all in whom he sees the image of his divine master and loves them because they are like Jesus. \"We know\", says the apostle \"that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren.

He died for sinners, for those even who were his murderers. It was love and good will to all which led him to give his life to save poor ruined man.\n3. Delight in the character of God & in communion with him is an evidence of christian character. We must love to go to God and tell him our need, and our sorrows, and joys, as to a dearly loved friend.\n4. The christian loves God's word. It is his daily meditation. He \"longs for its precepts\".

Whatever may be its merit it will not pay expenses unless some leading bookseller has a pecuniary interest in its success.  My advice to you is this.  If a publisher will give you $600 or $1000 for the copyright sell it to him.  Small as the amount seems it is in fact very large for an authors first book.  The publisher who buys it will then exert himself to make the investment good.  Your work will be pushed everywhere and when it gains you reputation you can make your own terms for the next one you write.  I fear however that you will not get this amount however poor a reward it may seem for your labor If so I then advise you to make terms with a publisher for half the profits - he taking the risque of all expense retaining at the sametime the copy-right in yourself","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":54810,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/54810","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e63db132f802575721b8d2efb45ab982.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e63db132f802575721b8d2efb45ab982.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e63db132f802575721b8d2efb45ab982.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e63db132f802575721b8d2efb45ab982.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-08T20:05:38+00:00","modified":"2020-03-19T14:01:21+00:00","filename":"e63db132f802575721b8d2efb45ab982.jpg","authentication":"09b738c4316c39dd4cd05d003fc318b4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"GR_1917-0003_o2.jpg","size":1494851,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2490,"resolution_y":3087,"compression_ratio":0.0648247237953}},"item":{"id":846,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/846","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"These were the terms upon which my work was published and they would have proved profitable if I had not been guilty of a folly which you must avoid.

Drew Walker very ill, \nMonday, December 2, 1901\nA cloudy chilly morning, all well Mr Shreve Badger, went back to his business this morning, very early, when we came down to breakfast at seven, Shreve was gone, he had his breakfast. I am afraid the damp cold morning will be bad for him as he still has cold in his chest, but he is so regular, and faithful, to buisness that he seldom lets anything interfere, by his close attention he has built up a large buisness, he is truly a self made man, is most generous to his family but indulges himself very little, and only goes out at night with his wife, he is a real domestic man, he does a great deal for many, but he is not appreciated enough. he certainly deserves much praise and thanks, he is devoted to his two boys, the youngest Shreve Jr. is wonderfully like his Father, in many ways, Edwin is like is Mother in everything.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":76783,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/76783","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/badb75d99017e604b519e398bc06faa4.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/badb75d99017e604b519e398bc06faa4.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/badb75d99017e604b519e398bc06faa4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/badb75d99017e604b519e398bc06faa4.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-13T15:13:31+00:00","modified":"2020-04-12T14:01:32+00:00","filename":"badb75d99017e604b519e398bc06faa4.jpg","authentication":"858b5765a5da2d82a8b62fac0debd8f1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":338,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03a_349_o2.jpg","size":1253057,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2308,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050270275691636},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["233456"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["233456"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["233456"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"badb75d99017e604b519e398bc06faa4.jpg","FileDateTime":1531494778,"FileSize":1253057,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2308\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2308,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:09 16:20:28","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:04 23:34:56","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:04 23:34:56","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":37,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1671,"ExifImageLength":2606,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803255,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1096,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1096","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"big snow storm at Kenilworth Mrs Gen Strong died.\nThursday, December 3, 1901\nThis morning was very dark.

The family was living in Brooklyn, New York, when Isaac decided to move them to the Middle West, where his sister Abigail and her husband Charles Cleveland were already settled. In 1841 and 1842, teenager Mary Sackett kept a lively, detailed journal of the journey from New York City to Laona, a small town in Winnebago County, Illinois. In 1847, when Mary Sackett was twenty-one, she married Hanson C. Pierson, who died a year later. In 1852 she married Samuel Chapman with whom she had six children. Little else is known about Sackett’s adult life, and she died at age forty-three in 1869. This journal was kept by Mary Sackett when she and her family emigrated from New York state to Laona, Winnebago County, Illinois in 1841-1842. <a href=\\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Sackett.xml\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">View collection guide</a> | <a target=\\"_blank\\" href=\\"https://archive.org/details/mms_038\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">View in digital collection</a>","lang":"","image":"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/files/original/87bcdf44a79bbf1e4c67f4df88dda548.jpg","pc":"2","pnr":"60","weight":"062040","needsreview":35,"incomplete":0,"complete":1,"count":58,"calc_needsrev":60.3448275862069,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":1.7241379310344827},{"id":"35","name":"Emma Wormwood diary, 1896","startDate":"1896","endDate":"1896","subjects":["Rowley family","Families","Farm life","Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

Printing, education, pioneer life, and religion are all discussed within the letters. Included are the papers of Robert Everett, the pastor of Welsh Congregationalist churches in Oneida County, New York, and publisher of Y Cenhadwr Americanaidd (The American Missionary), a Welsh religious reform magazine that was pro-abolition. Also included are letters and materials of Mary Everett, a graduate of New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, who was also involved in the suffrage movement, John Roberts and Sarah Colgrove Everett, pioneers who moved to Kansas Territory in 1854 and were active in abolitionist activities, and Cynthia Everett, a member of the American Missionary Association who taught freedmen in Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina, following the Civil War. <a href=\\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Everett.xml#series2\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">View collection guide</a><br /><br />Cynthia Everett (1839-1876) initially taught school in and around Remsen. In 1870 she went to Norfolk, VA and then Charleston, SC, with the American Missionary Association to teach freedmen.

He graduated from Wrexham Seminary in 1815, and soon after was ordained a minister with the Congregationalists at Capel Lôn Swan, Denbigh. During this time Everett learned a system of shorthand writing, which he adapted to the Welsh language and continued to use throughout his life. While at Denbigh he wrote an instructional book of this shorthand writing, as well as a Sunday school catechism first published in 1822. He married Elizabeth Roberts, of Denbigh, in 1816, and the couple emigrated to America in 1823 when Everett accepted a call to the Welsh Congregational Church of Utica, NY. He remained in Utica nine years, then moved south to Winfield to become pastor of the Congregational Church there, and also spent a short time as pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Westernville. In 1838 he settled in Steuben, near Remsen, NY, where he took charge of the two Welsh chapels there, Capel Ucha and Penymynydd. Everett continued as pastor in Steuben until his death in 1875. Included here are sermons delivered between 1800 and 1860. Note that the early sermons were most likely not written by Everett, but probably revised and delivered by him. <a href=\\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Everett.xml#sum\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">View collection guide</a>","lang":"","image":"","pc":"5","pnr":"6","weight":"010095","needsreview":11,"incomplete":0,"complete":10,"count":200,"calc_needsrev":5.5,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":5},{"id":"142","name":"Robert Everett sermons and writings, 1794-1860s Pt. 3","startDate":"1794","endDate":"1860","subjects":["Rowley family","Families","Farm life","Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

John and Sarah emigrated to Kansas Territory in 1854, and the letters detail the hardships of pioneer life as well as the violent and chaotic environment created by anti-slavery and pro-slavery forces fighting over the territory\'s status. An abolitionist, John Roberts Everett was active in the the Free Soil movement during his time in Kansas, and present with John Brown at the Battle of Osawatomie on August 30, 1856. Due to Sarah\'s failing health, the family moved back east. After Sarah\'s death in 1864, John lived briefly with family in New York and worked for his father\'s printing press, but later returned to Kansas with and established himself as a farmer. Later letters describe personal news, health, and farm issues.","lang":"","image":"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/files/original/fefa348385865c311fdb95de7ed7c7fa.jpg","pc":"5","pnr":"3","weight":"008097","needsreview":4,"incomplete":0,"complete":7,"count":140,"calc_needsrev":2.857142857142857,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":5},{"id":"154","name":"Sarah Everett Pritchard letters, 1852-1880s","startDate":"1852","endDate":"1880","subjects":["Rowley family","Families","Farm life","Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

Included are the couple\'s courtship letters as well as correspondence during later separations when one or the other of them was traveling, and a collection of their small diaries. There is correspondence and a few transcriptions of the narration of Charles Reed (Abby J. Reed\'s brother) concerning his 1849 overland journey to California and his subsequent adventures with the Washington City and California Mining Association, his prospecting on the Feather River and near Downieville, and his 1854 survival of a shipwreck off the California coast. News of close friends who took the Panama route to California is also included in the correspondence of Agnes Allen.

Jacobs, an attorney of Greeley, Colorado, consisting mainly of letters to him from Clarence Darrow. Written between 1909 and 1926, the letters provide documentation of friendship, professional collaboration, and a shared interest in reading. They also demonstrate the famous lawyer\'s concern and affection for his only child, Paul, who was living in Greeley as the manager of the Greeley Gas and Fuel Company. Subjects include the case of Stewart v. Ramsay; some allusions to Darrow\'s legal role in the Los Angeles bombing case and his bribery indictment; recommended reading and opinions on philosophical and psychological books; Darrow\'s desire to rent and/or own a cottage in Estes Park, Colorado; money and investments, and above all, Paul\'s welfare. <a href=\\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/JacobsDarrow.xml\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">View catalog guide</a>","lang":"","image":"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/files/original/a761f1a83b8a28788f634f22bb55f423.jpg","pc":"58","pnr":"21","weight":"079079","needsreview":8,"incomplete":0,"complete":22,"count":38,"calc_needsrev":21.052631578947366,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":57.89473684210527},{"id":"200","name":"Elbert Ozial Taylor writings, undated\\r\\n","startDate":null,"endDate":null,"subjects":["Rowley family","Families","Farm life","Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

His father was a well-known abolitionist who was later nominated as the first vice presidential candidate for the Liberty Party. In 1876, Francis J. LeMoyne erected the first crematorium in the United States near Washington, Pennsylvania. John LeMoyne studied law in Pittsburgh and was admitted to the bar in 1852. That same year he toured the West, deciding to moved to Chicago and begin his law practice. He married with his wife, Julia, the following year. In 1872, LeMoyne became a candidate for the 43rd Congress on the Liberal Party ticket, but was defeated. He ran again for the 44th Congress as a Democrat and won. He served in Congress from May 6, 1876 to March 3, 1877. After losing the re-election, John continued his law practice in Chicago and was known as a \\"lawyer of excellent standing and ability\\".

The letters touch on many subjects that concerned typical Americans during World War I, the 1920s and then the Depression, such as the shortages and hardships, the influenza epidemic, the League of Nations, Prohibition, Hoover’s presidency, labor strikes, and so on. Daland offers much advice to Gerard, who was always in need of money and clothes, and to her daughter who was becoming an unsuccessful artist.

Before her marriage to William J. Calhoun, she had been a freelance art critic for Chicago newspapers as well as national publications. When her husband served as U.S. minister to China, she became the social leader of the diplomatic community in Peking.<br /><br />After her husband’s death, Lucy Calhoun served in the war effort in France in World War I. In the 1920’s she returned to Peking, established her home in an ancient temple, collected art, and become an “institution” in the city. She remained in Peking until the Japanese occupation of the city in 1937.Lucy Monroe Calhoun died in Chicago in 1950, aged 85.<br /><br />The collection includes six letters by Lucy Monroe Calhoun and three by husband William J. Calhoun (U.S.Minister to China, 1909-1913), regarding their experiences in China during the last years of the Qing Dynasty. One letter describes in detail the wedding of Emperor Puyi in December, 1922. A seventh letter relates Lucy Calhoun’s visit to LeMans, France, which served as an embarkation point for troops at the conclusion of World War I. <a href=\\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=817922\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">View collection guide</a>","lang":"","image":"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/files/original/8da2b561a2331106a3c95f633a269790.jpg","pc":"","pnr":"17","weight":"017083","needsreview":14,"incomplete":0,"complete":0,"count":82,"calc_needsrev":17.073170731707318,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":0},{"id":"218","name":"Jenny Dufau letters [in Italian], 1913-1917","startDate":"1913","endDate":"1917","subjects":["Rowley family","Families","Farm life","Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

By 1912 she was singing important roles in Die Walkyrie in German, The Barber of Seville and The Jewels of the Madonna in Italian, and The Tales of Hoffmann in English. A native of Alsace-Lorraine, Dufau had arrived on the Chicago musical scene in 1910 following studies in Berlin, and almost immediately was successful with audiences. After 1916 she concentrated on a concert career, appearing at Ravinia and in Hamilton Park concert series, in Orchestra Hall and in Boston, among other places. In May, 1916, she sang with the silent film The Law Decides, which was one of the latest of entertainments called “Cinema Concerts.” In a 1917 recital at Orchestra Hall she sang La Marseillaise as apparently was the custom, followed by “an eclectic program” of Russian, Swedish and French songs, along with new songs written for her by Frank LaForge. Dufau’s name no longer appears in the Chicago papers after 1917, so presumably she returned to Europe at the end of the war.<br /><br />This collection consists almost entirely of letters written to Jenny Dufau by an Italian lover named Gaetano Riccuilli from September 1915, to April 1917, while Dufau was performing with the Chicago Grand Opera Company. Most of these letters concern his family or hers, the events of his daily life, the fact of their separation due to the war, and his many moods. Ricciulli apparently was an active service army officer on disability leave at the time of these letters.<br /><br />The principle historical interest of the letters lies in the many passing references to the war, especially to its disruption of civilian life in Italy, and to a lesser degree in France and Switzerland. There are repeated references to censorship, and the development of censorship is traceable by evidence on the envelopes. For a brief time after the start of censorship his letters become more circumspect, but they return to the passionate tone of the earlier ones fairly quickly. One letter speculates on the possibility that America may enter the war on the side of the Italian-French-English alliance. Except in a very general way, there is no information here on the progress of the war itself or of civilian morale, as these topics undoubtedly would have been censored. <a href=\\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=808377\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">View collection guide</a>\\n<p></p>","lang":"Italian","image":"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/files/original/2470ae3e27e127ba3b18873fd5412df5.jpg","pc":"","pnr":"1","weight":"001099","needsreview":1,"incomplete":0,"complete":0,"count":194,"calc_needsrev":0.5154639175257731,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":0},{"id":"219","name":"Hannah Hayden letters, 1806-1866","startDate":"1806","endDate":"1866","subjects":["Rowley family","Families","Farm life","Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

Augusta Hurd died in 1921 and Mary Hurd Arno died in 1925.<br /><br />This collection is composed mainly of letters from Mary Olivia Hurd Arno to her mother, 1886-1897, with six letters of Augusta Jaquins Hurd to her father and brother, 1858-1866, and seventeen miscellaneous letters either to her or retained by her.<br /><br />Note: This collection has been published; see <em>The Letters of Ann Augusta Jaquins Hurd and Mary Olivia Hurd Arno, 1858-1897</em>, edited by Helen Hazen Cooperman (Chicago: Cooperman, 1988). <a href=\\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=808762\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">View collection guide</a>","lang":"","image":"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/files/original/c51fa106d35969ddb30cf35edfdee1a2.jpg","pc":"1","pnr":"19","weight":"020081","needsreview":54,"incomplete":0,"complete":4,"count":286,"calc_needsrev":18.88111888111888,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":1.3986013986013985},{"id":"223","name":"Parish family letters, 1884-1896","startDate":"1884","endDate":"1896","subjects":["Rowley family","Families","Farm life","Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

The collection also includes miscellaneous material relating to her medical service from April, 1898, to December, 1899, and two narratives of her experiences, one by her and one by her (later) executor Esther Turkington. <a href=\\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=184085\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">View collection guide</a>","lang":"","image":"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/files/original/40b456dd59d8fb7d4c95c1a611ef759a.jpg","pc":"19","pnr":"","weight":"019100","needsreview":0,"incomplete":0,"complete":50,"count":262,"calc_needsrev":0,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":19.083969465648856},{"id":"801","name":"Carlos W.

Hitz was a lifelong resident of Indianapolis, where he died in 1949. A graduate of Indiana University, Mr. Hitz was devoted to the intellectual and charitable institutions of his state, and throughout his life he was an avid collector of books and manuscripts, particularly of explorations of the Middle West and the works of Mary Webb and Willa Cather. His collection of Cather first editions and Cather-related correspondence was sold to the Newberry Library after his death. <br /><br />Although born in Virginia in 1873, Willa Cather was transplanted to Nebraska when she was nine. Her life on the pioneering frontier of the Great Plains made a lasting impression on her, shaping her talent and interests as she became familiar with the struggles for survival of the immigrant farm families she came to know. Her observations and the kinship she felt for the new Americans of Nebraska was later reflected in much of her fiction, notably in two of her best-known novels, O Pioneers (1913) and My Antonia (1918). <br /><br />Cather graduated from the University of Nebraska in 1895 and began a career first as a teacher and then as a magazine editor, finally settling in New York City in 1906 as editor of McClure\'s Magazine. During these years she traveled a good deal, developing a special affection both for France and the American Southwest - the latter described lovingly in the novel Death Comes for the Archbishop - and in 1912 she decided to concentrate on supporting herself as a free-lance writer. What followed was a life dedicated to writing, one in which she published twelve novels and fifty-eight short stories that brought her much popularity and numerous honors and prizes. <br /><br />Willa Cather, generally regarded as one of the twentieth century\'s major American writers, died in New York in 1947. <a href=\\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/HitzCather.xml\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">View collection guide</a>","lang":"","image":"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/files/original/7816952ce2c2980f01ad41c5380a276f.jpg","pc":"28","pnr":"","weight":"028100","needsreview":0,"incomplete":0,"complete":32,"count":114,"calc_needsrev":0,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":28.07017543859649},{"id":"828","name":"Willa Cather - Irene Miner Weisz Papers, 1912-1958","startDate":"1912","endDate":"1958","subjects":["Rowley family","Families","Farm life","Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

Among other activities the Miner girls and Cather put on plays to entertain friends and families, and as the years passed they remained friends and correspondents. Irene Miner married Charles W. Weisz and spent her adult life in Chicago. <br /><br />Although Willa Cather was born in Virginia, in 1883 when she was 9, her father moved the family to Nebraska. This transition from the orderly South to the pioneering frontier of the Great Plains made a lasting impression on her and in her cultured but rather tomboyish youth she observed and became familiar with immigrant farm families struggling to conquer a sometimes hostile environment. The kinship she felt for the new Americans of Nebraska was later reflected in much of her fiction, notably in two of her best-known novels, O Pioneers!

Some of these, as with the Miner sisters dating from her early life in Red Cloud, Nebraska, lasted all her life.

Sheridan through the mountains of southern Colorado to Santa Fe, N.M., probably intended as a memorial to Sheridan upon his death in 1888. The party, which also included Col. M.V. Sheridan, Capt. James Gregory, and Col. Henry T. Farrar, travelled first by rail, exploring the new routes through the Royal Gorge of the Arkansas River and up the La Veta Pass. In particular, Strong discusses the party’s camping accomodations, the scenery encountered, the engineering and construction of difficult rail routes, and the wagon train’s treacherous passage from Grassy Hill to Niegoldstown over the Stony Pass. <a href=\\"https://webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=132794\\">View catalog record</a>","lang":"","image":"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/files/original/2cad361f457ca6c64a5d62aa1f506f7c.jpg","pc":"71","pnr":"29","weight":"100071","needsreview":24,"incomplete":0,"complete":59,"count":83,"calc_needsrev":28.915662650602407,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":71.08433734939759},{"id":"979","name":"Grand Trip Across the Plains, 1859","startDate":"1859","endDate":"1859","subjects":["Rowley family","Families","Farm life","Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

The overland diary begins Sept. 7, 1849, when the travelling party had reached the remains of the Donner Party camp in the Sierra Nevada, continues via Bear Valley to Sacramento, and ends in San Francisco on Oct. 8, 1849. It contains descriptions of food shortages, wagon travel across mountain ranges, and gold rush Sacramento and San Francisco. The journal of the 1851 voyage from San Francisco to New York describes hardships of travel on the recently inaugurated Nicaragua route via San Juan and Greytown, and an Atlantic voyage plagued by an inexperienced captain, coal and food shortages, and a massive storm. Journals of the 1854 voyages to and from San Francisco describe the Isthmus of Panama route and an encounter with Santa Anna\'s fleet, which was blockading the Acapulco harbor. <a href=\\"https://webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=141142\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">View catalog record</a>","lang":"","image":"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/files/original/992a7601c4ac50f1117e1d41a58cc0fa.jpg","pc":"2","pnr":"3","weight":"005097","needsreview":0,"incomplete":0,"complete":0,"count":140,"calc_needsrev":0,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":0},{"id":"1047","name":"Creek Indians discussion between Alabama governor Clement C.

Responding to Benjamin Silliman (1841), Catlin defends his conclusions regarding the pipe stone quarry and forwards a copy of his new \\"Letters and notes on the manners ... of the North American Indians,\\" which contained his observations on the subject.

She describes their poverty-stricken, desperate and humiliating existence, with no medical care, and in some cases, living five or six to a single ten-foot-square log cabin. Caswell also refers to her own health problems, incessant chills, exhaustion, and feelings of inadequacy: \\"Blue! Desperate!

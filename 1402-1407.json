They do that sort of thing.\n\nI wish that into it there had come some of the things you said in your letter - about how the\npainter - a real one really feels.\n\n People are such fools. shrewd? people who would be fairly? alive in judging another person\n\nlet themselves be so fr?ked about art.\n\n It is due sometimes to a kind of decent? banuility? too. This reason - this artist - they think - having\n\nbeen told some such thing - lives in a strange rarified atmosphere.\n\n This gives the little talkers? such a ? chance - they all set themselves up.\n The man who couldn't possibly be sold a second rate horse will fall for any kind of\n\nsecond rate painting.\n\n Because he doesn't a p himself to receive? it."

I gave him something and said - \"Come on, lets walk and talk a little.\"  He told me that he had walked all the night before - no money for a bed - zero weather.  His eyes were hard - that and there was something - that curious dirtiness and rancousness? that comes of never changing your clothes - sleeping in them etc. So as we walked I asked him - \"why don't you tie up with the reds?\"  He looked at me with suspicion and then decided I was OK but said he believed in individualism.  \"I'd rather be a lone wolf - even if I starve\" he said. \"I might beat the game yet.\"\n\nRugged individualism - you see.  It will apparently be a long time before Americans can the down & outs - realize that individualism of that sort has only come to us, ?oling up over someone? else?.  Page Jesus Christ."

For two years I have lived alone, without a woman.  I can go to her house, dine there, drive with her, walk with her in the road.  She has many interests, is now writing a thesis for her Phd - at Columbia.  She works too - in fi?ally and is very strong, a woman of 34, small and strong, with black hair and eyes, quite sympathetic.  Life hasn't been spoiled for her.  God knows what the Town here thinks of her.  I have some friends"

The boat having reached there about 1 o'clock in the afternoon, we got off and went into the village.  The wharf was surrounded by the natives, some wearing a piece of cloth draped below their waist and some not so much.  They are a very, very brown class of people, not black like our negroes and some of them can speak a little English.  We visited the Budda temple.  Had to take off our shoes before entering."

We went riding in a rickshaw and practically rode all afternoon and it cost only about 72 cents in our money.  The poor natives pulling these rickshaws were very skinny and actually they took the pace of a horse trotting along.  I felt very sorry for them because the sweat poured down from being so hot.  Going up and down the streets you'd see the people walking along with a huge bunch of bananas balanced on their heads, or anything they might happen to be carrying.  Some of the women have rings in their nose and in their ears.  If I lived a hundred years I could never tell you all I saw and how thrilled I was."

Riding thru the park you could see coconut trees, banananas growing here and there.\nWhen you'd go into a store the dealers would nearly eat you up trying to make a sale.  There are so many of these natives, that some of them don't even get enough to eat, so when a boat comes into port they beg for money and will sell anything to make a penny or a rupee.\nI bought quite a few cards but didn't mail them Will send them out when I get to France.

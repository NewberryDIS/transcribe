York for London.\nThat duty I intended to have discharged\nlong ere this in giving you at last some\naccount of the success which my labours\nhave met with in this country.\nDuring the last six months I have\nbeen so almost entirely enveloped and\nenslaved in filling out my work with\nnear 400 engravings that I have had no\ntime for correspondence. And\njust at the completion of it, I have\nbeen mortified beyond expression, as\nwell as incensed, by the information\nwhich a subsequent traveller has given you\nof Chi Red Pipe Stone, and which it seems\nhas been studiously designed to injure the \nreputation of my work which is now\nAyer N.A. ms 146","553acb21e1d988e72e95ca266247f38e.jpg"],[72371,"out and just to go before the world.\nI am much obliged to you for the manner\nin which you replied to him as I learned by\nyour note sent to me by Wiley J. Putnam.\nI shall say but very little in reply in this place,  as\nmy assertions, whatever they were, are before \nthe world, in my Book, & as I consider \nunder oath, I am quite contented that they\nshall speak for themselves. You need not \nfear that I gave you knowingly or otherwise\nanything in my description of that place in\nyour journal of science that was untrue,\nif I did, time, at least will bring upon\nthe deserved reproach. I send you \nby this Steamer my work, which you will\nbe kind enough to accept and you \nmay take what is said of the pipe stone\nquarry for matter of fact which will stand\nthe test, at all events with such ignorant\n& purile authority as that which would\nexpose its [? atness ?] by so gross an absurdity\nas that the pipe stone is dug up in a soft state\nand laid under leaves by the Indians to prevent\nit from cracking in the sun! I assert this\nto be so palpable a falsehood, that I am\ndisposed to [scratched out word] doubt the fact your secret correspondent,\nhowever “respectable” never saw the \npipe stone quarry. I assert it to be grossly\nfalse that the stone hardens to any perceptible\n[end page]","3708df106ffdea92f373f7ea1a4ec4a3.jpg"],[72372,"degree by exposure to the air, for I dug up some\nhundreds of pounds of it, nor does it in the\nleast shrink or crack by exposure to the air\nthe sun, and without exceeding reluctance\nin the most intense heat, which I publish\n& defy contradiction, as one of the most \nextraordinary & [? peculiare] qualities of it.\nThe great mistake is [?] , that your unfortunate\nyoung man had not the good fortune to reach it before\nI did. Too many travelers who get fagged out and\nsicken on the track of those who have gone before them\n(& beyond even the reach of their imaginations) without\ndiscovering anything anew, see everything that they do\nsee with a jaundiced or unrelishing eye, and for\nwant of something else to communicate, are apt\nto take a pleasure I holding them up to the world as\nliars and public deceivers. In my Book you will see \nan accurate delineation of the pipe stone quarry & read\nmy description of it- which I [? mention] to say will bear\nThe test. If your correspondent, (whom I cannot call by\nName, and whose name I care not a fig for) cannot avoid\nso gross an absurdity as the one I have above named, don’t rely\nupon him for any account of Indian superstitions & traditions\nof which I am sure he learned far less of in Yale College than he\ndid of minerals. The information I have gathered and embodied\nin my book, if half of it were lies and [?dross]\nwould be, and I will be, of more value to this world than \nall the he make. I venture to say, if he is\nto tell me “that the Indians have no superstitions about\nthe Red Pipe, & that they cover it with leaves\n& grass","e7f3159cdbe42563ab381c4e7b3f15e2.jpg"],[72373,"is within 6 or 8 inches of the surface. \n\n   as to the \"honour\" of having this mineral called \"Catlinite\"\n\nwhich he says \"he thinks I do not deserve\", I am quite\nsure I never claimed & it will be seen by my letters \n& all my account of it in my book. I have chose\nto call it by its Indian name \"pipe stone\" as he chooses, and in \nthat will no doubt have per?? ased his envious feelings. \nas for his apertion that \"I was not the first white man\nwho ever visited it\" I think he is right as to the matter\nof fact, but puffijish? as to the ground upon which \nhe has taken the liberty to brand me as a liar - for\nI never aported? (until by a misprint of my words)\nthat I was the first white man who met them\nbut on the contrary, always in my letters spoke\nof Mous. Lopombaise who practicly escorted us\nthere & who had been there on former occasions. \nA similar announcement to this was made by a fur trader\n(a seller of whiskey & buyer of muskrat skins)\nin one of the Cincinnati papers not long since, which \nyou may have seen, & which you will see in a \nfew days answered in the same journal, and \nyou will here see, (& I think you can by this time \nsurely? why I have been this studiously impeached\nlain before my expose of the transactions of that \nWestern Country are coming out to the world - \nI hope your young friend has a more harmless and \n les? malignant material for impeaching me than they \nhave & hope also that he has got something better to \nstand on than hearsay from them, though I fear he\nhas based his charges solely upon their representations. \nThese people you will see have called me a liar for \nhaving said I was arrested by the Sioux on my way\nto the Red pipe, look at my account in my book, \n& enquire of Mr. Nood?, who was my companion.

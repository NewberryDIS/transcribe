Jones, Washington City. - The General had the honor to transmit, on the 2d instant, for the information of the government, the copy of a demand to Mr. Ross by captain Armstrong himself for the murderers of the Ridges and Boudinos?, together with his reply there to; in which he not only refuses to deliver them up, but denies the right of the United States to try or punish them. The General says that Mr. Ross also denies","ae3eb06eb95c1bd92f65cce263205b7e.jpg"],[71011,"1839\nOct 8 , continued.\nalso denies any knowledge of the murderers, yet, that, from information received not only from his enemies but his friends, it appears that the death of the Ridges and Boudinos was determined on? at the Double Spring Council Ground in here? last, and that the party that killed John Ridge started from that Council Ground for that express purpose; and that John Ross was at that time performing duties of headman, or principal chief; - yet still, observes the General, he denies any knowledge that these acts were to be committed, or of the persons who committed them. The General adds that these circumstances, together with the facts equal proceedings of Mr Ross, with which Gen: Jones has been furnished, will enable the government to judge for itself as to the truth of the Ross's assertion. The General states that, although he has received assurances from some of the principal men of the Cherokee nation, that no resistance would be made to the troops in executing the orders of the government, yet the General has subsequently received information that Daniel Colston?, one of the individuals implicated, says he will assemble his friends and tell sell his life as dearly as possible, should any attempt be made to take him; and the General is apprehensive, that, no truth standing","509a952b63d2dd2d671350726bb5e768.jpg"],[71012,"1839\nOct : 8 : continued.\nnotwithstanding the influence of the chiefs will be exerted to prevent the lower class of the Indians from opposing the troops, they may be induced to do so in consequence of the excited state of feeling in the Cherokee nation at the time he writes. He says that information has also been received, that, since the demand for the murderers, John Ross has sent beads and tobacco to the chief of the upper Creeks; and, it is presumed, adds the General, that he has made similar friendly overtures to the surrounding tribes. The General observes that these circumstances, together with his own conviction that the troops may be opposed, and thereby cause a war between the United States and the Cherokee nation, has induced him to notify the Governor of Arkansas that the militia of the state may be required; and also to request the Governor of Missouri to have a brigade near the southeastern border of his state, in readiness to turn out and defend their border; at the same time informing him that he, Gen Arbuckle, was not authorized by the government to make the call, yet circumstances might render such a measure necessary. the General mentions that he has also","39b595412e82eda520c7cd2d06ed6201.jpg"],[71013,"1839.\nOct: 8, continued. \nrequested the creeks to organize themselves into companies regiments that they might act in conjunction with other troops, should their services be required by the United States. Although the General believes that the great majority of the Creek nation are friendly disposed towards the United States at this time, still he knows not how far the measures Mr? Ross may affect them; but he cannot believe so far as to cause them to act against the United States, though perhaps to remain neutral. He observes that some of the band of Alligator, a Seminole chief, who has located himself in the Cherokee nation, with about one hundred warriors, lately paid a visit to John Ross. - Gen: Arbuckle says that the demand for the murderer would have been deferred until the dragoons were ready to out, (which they were not, in consequence of being separated from their horses,) had if not been supposed by captain Armstrong and himself, that such a demand would prevent others of the treaty party from being killed; an attempt having been made to that effect only a short time previous; - but that Lieut: Col: Mason having now sent for his horses, the General will be able in a week or two to commence operations in seizing such individuals as have been, or may be, reported to him, who will, he has no doubt, (if they do not determine on resistance;)","ec61b790c00b33cb868c458a288e9fb9.jpg"],[71014,"159\n1839.\nOct: 8 : continued.\nresistance) leave the country so soon as they find they are closely pressed? by the troops. - The General ? is necessary to remark, that, the finall number of officers present with the dragoons, and the sickly condition of his men, will render Colonel Mason's command less efficient than the General could with; - as is will be seen that the dragoon force is fresh suited for the service required. -\nRep: Doc: No 2: ?\n?: 1st ?: p. 422.\nOct 8. \nGen: Stokes, United States Cherokee ?, as the Cherokee Agency, Bayou Menard, writes to John Ross, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation. - The Agent has received the letter of the Principal Chief bearing date in the day he answers if, and enclosing three communication from the Cherokee Council: to use: The late act of union; - the proceedings of the Cherokee Council relative to the causes of dis union among the Cherokees, and also to the demand of the United States Government, for the surrender of certain persons, supposed to be concerned in killing the two Ridges and Boudinot; and the resolution relative to the expulsion of Eiren? Jones, from the Cherokee country. - For these communications, the Agent begs the Principal Chief to accept his sincere thanks. He adds that copies of the two first have been forwarded to the war department; but with respect","9b04f1d8eb4e2772ba8f745486e89b71.jpg"],[71015,"1839\nOct: 8 . continued.\nrespect to the one relating to Mr E. Jones, the Agent has detained is until the neat maid; because he does not well recollect whether he sent the Principal Chief the order of the War Department alone; or whether he sent also, the letter from the Secretary of War to Mr Lucius Bolles, corresponding Secretary of the Baptist Board of Foreign Missions. - As the Agent did not consider that letter as any part of the order of the War Department, he thinks if probable that he did not send it, especially as he had no disposition to act on any extraneous matter to the injury of Air Jones. He now sends a copy of the letter to Mr Bolles; and if it produces any change in the terms of the resolution of Council in this case, the Agent requests the Principal Chief will be good enough to inform him. \nOct: 10. -\nCapt: Jim? Armstrong, Acting Superintendant western Territory, at the Choctaw? Agency west, writes to T. Hartley Crawford ?, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Washington City: - The Superintendant, in obedience to the instruction of the Commissioner, had called in Gen: Arbuckle, and after consulting with him upon the subject of arresting the murderers of the Ridges + Boudinos","3d6aa1f4a0510c6b38485fd6608ecf56.jpg"],[71016,"161\n1839\nOct 10. continued.\nBoudinor, the General of the Superintendant deemed it mark prudent to make a demand of the murderers pun? Mr Ross, as chief of the emigrants by whom the murders were committed. The Superintendant says that, owing to the small force, together with the fact that a portion of the command was at Fort Wayne, preparing tables, or, for the horses belonging to the dragoons, the General was not prepared to have a tempted ? arrest those of the murderers whose names had been furnished them; and that, to have delayed until he could have been prepared, might have endangered the lives of others of the treaty party, who were liable to be murdered at any time, and were at the time concealed in the nation, and at times written the state of Arkansas. He adds, that when it was ? that the government had demanded the murderers, the Ross party would probably refrain from further bloodshed. The General + the Superintendant, before any thing was done, saws the Creek chiefs; having been aware that Mr Ross had been sending tobacco, with friendly talks, to them, and would probably continue to for as troublesome as he could; hence, while every exertion should be and, and no effort left undone, to preserve peace, it seemed proper to counteract any unfavourable impression that might be made or attempted on","1c95ad0faa0d75e949f2340a9767e2db.jpg"],[71017,"1839\nOct 10: continued.\nattempted on any of the other tribes. The Superintendant insisted the Choctau general Council; he found that the proceedings of Mr Ross's council had been sent to one of the chiefs. Mr Superintendant cannot think that the Cherokees will resist, especially as they will find the ? unaided by their red brethren. He adds that when Gen. Arbuckle sends out a company to take the murderers, if resistance is made at all, it will be these; but that, however, it is very hard to tell what course Mr Ross will adopt. - The great object of the Superintendant has been to inform the surrouding tribes of the true state of things; for he cannot think, without their cooperation, that any difficulty will arise. -\nRep: Doc: No 2.

Poinsett, Secretary of War, at Washington City, writes to Gen: Arbuckle, at Fort Gibson. - The Secretary had read + considered the General's communications of the 4th ultims?, and others, addressed to the Adjutant General. He says the letter of the commissioner of Indian affairs to the agent will have informed the General of the areas of that department in relation to the political differences unfortunately exciting between the former + recent immigrants of the Cherokee nation. He thinks if highly desirable + declares such to h the urih? of the government, that they should assemble in council together, and be governed by the declared will of the majority of the whole nation fairly","dbcf40e6ba018e6b599b5633d72d331e.jpg"],[71018,"163\n1839\nOct: 12: continued.\nfairly and properly obtained; but he adds, that while this principle will govern the department in the exercise of their Superintendence over the tribe, it will not suffer that majority to exercise any tyranny towards those persons who may be odious to them, nor especially to commit any outrages upon those Cherokees who signed or adhered to the treaty of New Echota. He declares that the news of the cruel murder of the Ridges was received with just indignation by the department, and that the summons to Genge W. Adain, J. A. Bell, and others, to appear before the Council on the 4th of September, to answer for their conduct in signing that treaty, is regarded as a gross usurpation of power which will not be sanctioned or allowed; - and that whatever may be the opinion of the chiefs and people who last emigrated, as to the character of the transaction, they shall not be permitted to punish or persecute those who, in good faith and with upright and honest intentions, executed that instrument, and faithfully complied with its provisions. The Secretary desires the General, without delay, to communicate this determination of the department to the chiefs and head men of the Cherokee nation, and that he will, with all possible dispatch, convey to him their reply, in order, if they persist in their unjustifiable measures, that prompt defficient steps may be taken to protect the parties ? with further outrage, and","61d57b93fc93ad7880fe758f3832bf0b.jpg"],[71019,"1839\nOct 12, continued.\nand to bring to justice the perpetrator of such acts of violence. \nRep: Doc: No 2. ?\nCons: ?: p: 416.\nOct 13.\nJohn Ross, Principal Chief of the Cherokees, I. Vaun, Assistant Chief, W. Sherey Coodey, President of the National Committee, + Moury Wolf, Speaker of the Council, at Tablequah?, Cherokee Nation, address Mr Hoker ?, United States Agent for the Cherokees. - The writers announce that the National Council, which had been for some time in session at that place, adjourned on the day proceeding; the two communities of the Cherokee people, having, by their act of union, become one, and such measures having been adopted as seemed to have been required for the preservation of order + the advancement of the general welfare. - The writers represent that as various important questions and much business with the government of the United States, both at a public and private character, yet remain unsettled, and which require to be adjusted as early as possible, the Council determined on sending a delegation for that purpose to Washington. They accordingly appointed John Ross, Principal Chief, W. Sherey Coodey, Edward Gunter, Richard Taylor, Joseph M. Lynch, Jorney? Price,","54800f8c66a48ec2b199680956edf9fa.jpg"],[71020,"165\n1839\nOct: 13: continued.\nJohn Looney, Elijah Hick, and Jefre Busheyhead; which the writer report to the Agent, in order that it may be communicated to the United States government. They declare that the Cherokees have no desire other than the promotion of their welfare, and the cultivation of the utmost good feeling and friendship for the United States. They flatter themselves that thenceforward these will exist no local cause to disquiet public feeling, and that harmony will prevail uninterrupted throughout the country. They say that possibly there may be a few disaffected person; it is not unlikely; because they are to be found in all communities; but no danger is apprehended to the peace of the country, the wholesome operation of the laws will prevail as a remedy for such evils; and they trust the agents and officers of the government will not permit the wanton fabrications from such a source, to cause doubt of the council and just course of the nation in all its public transactions. The writers add that it may also be proper to apprise the Agent that Mr Lewis? Ross has been appointed national treasurer, and that he is authorized to receive any public funds which may be transmitted for payment to the Cherokees.","b89bc5f903b0052c87260d385a8bec0c.jpg"],[71021,"1839\nOct: 14. -\nGen: Arbuckle at Fort Gibson, writes to John Ross, Principal Chief of the late Emigrant Cherokees near Illinois river. - The General was furnished on the evening before by the United States agent for the Cherokees, with the letter addressed to him by Mr Ross on the 7th instant, and also a copy of the proceedings of the 12th of July previous; having already received the paper signed by John Looney and others. - The General declares, that the tenor + character of these papers, which he has not leisure at present to notice generally, are regarded as highly exceptionable, particularly the letter of Mr Ross to the Agent, and that they certainly do not establish the fact of a union having taken place between the late emigrant Cherokees and the old settlers. He continues, that the act of union (as it is called) which bears date on the 12th of July, is signed by a few unauthorized individuals of the government of the old settlers; - and it is presumed, were all the old settlers then at the assemblage, who were wiling to sign only then, ? the Generals plan that paper; and John Looney and some old settlers, who it is understood Mr Ross had collected at his convention, by sending out agents in all directions for them, (much to the disquiet of the old settlers), notified them, as it is generally reported and believed, that if they did not come in + support John Ross, that they, as wellas","97e3ecd6270c5079a564161d58703470.jpg"],[71022,"167\n1839\nOct 14. continued.\nas well as the Cherokee people generally, would fail to obtain pay for the lands they left on the east of the Mississippi, with other remarks calculated to disturb the quiet of this old settlers, and impair their confidence in their chiefs. The General states that it is understood that it was with such a party, generally, that John Looney acted in signing a paper, or decree, on the 23d of August last, deporting his brother chiefs Brown and Rogers, which the General ? to be Drawn? up in the language of all the decrees which were passed by Mr Ross's convention, and which therefore he is authorized in believing to have been prepared under the directions of Mr Ross, if not written by himself. The General observes that the fourth paragraph of that decree complains, that \"they\", (meaning Brown and rogers), have continued to oppose the friendly reunion of the two parties,\" ?, when it could not have been forgotten by Mr Looney or Mr Ross, that he (Mr Looney) acted with Brown and Rogers on the 28th of June last, in making, as it is now believed, the only fair proposition that was made, with the object of uniting the old settlers + the late emigrants. The General remarks that, this being the fact, as it certainly is, how will Mr Looney + all others acquainted with the proposition having been made, acquit themselves of a ? and corrupt disregard of truth.","a5cdf78a568c514ce12bbdac743cd5aa.jpg"],[71023,"1839\nOct: 14: continued. \nThese facts, the General judges to be entirely sufficient to prove that no union between the late emigrants and old settlers has taken place, or that the small minority of the old settlers who deposed their chiefs, could give validity to such an act; and, adds the General, the proceedings of the convention of Mr Ross, conclusively from that Mr Ross would not have met the chiefs of the old settlers at Fort Gibson, or at any place, where he could not have enjoyed a positive control over them and over every measure he desired to mature. - The General observes that in the late communications of Mr Ross, he abounds in the expressions of good feelings towards the citizens of the United States, and of his desire to maintain peace, to allay strife with his own people, and discharge his duty to the government of the United States. It would afford the General much pleasure if the professions + acts of Mr Ross corresponded in their particulars. Mr Ross remarks in his letter to the Cherokee Agent, that the Agent is perhaps approved that the people of the country have acted \"upon the subject\" (meaning the murderers of the Ridges and Boudinos, and the treaty party,) in a manner satisfactory to themselves. The General says it is not doubted that they have done so, so far as relates","7aa6d8e4b8ce308e9612171574f86ffc.jpg"],[71024,"169\n1839\nOct: 14: continued.\nas relates to a party, and, perhaps, to the greater portion of the late Cherokee emigrants; but he asks, how does this settle the claims of justice, and the obligations of the United States, who are bound \"to protect the Cherokees from domestic Strike?\" The General observes that Mr Ross alleges these in no law to punish the murderers if they are surrendered. If so, says the General, they will be soon released; but that, be this as it may, Mr Ross cannot doubt that, by their treaties with the United States, and by the Intercourse Law, it was his duty to have surrendered them in compliance with the demands made on him. The General says as Mr Ross has not complied with his duty in this respect, he intends to sent out parties as soon as convenience permits, to apprehend them; and the General will require the parties so employed, to be accompanied by suitable guides, and others, that are acquainted with the","9f726b03d859b7d367631cd3f04ae17b.jpg"],[71025,"1839\nOct 14, continued.\nwith the individuals to be apprehended. The General promises that no unoffending citizen of the Cherokee nation will be disturbed, or in any way ill treated; therefore, concludes that General, if the discharge of this duty should lead to serious difficulties, the blame will be with Mr Ross, and his people. -\nNov. 2.\nGen. Arbuckle at Fort Gibson writes to John Ross, Principal Chief of the late Emigrant Cherokees. - The General says, it having been reported to him that threats have been made by the Cherokees against any Cherokee who should aid the troops in searching for the individuals implicated in the late murders, he thought it advisable to inform Mr Ross, that Hercules S. Marin, the United States Cherokee Agent's Interpreter would accompany the troops as an interpreter, and in no other capacity; and that should it be necessary to employ a Cherokee or Cherokees to point out these individuals (they not being personally known to the officer) although it is not the General's intention to do so, other persons can be obtained, - Mr Ross must","6e98ce10e7ea811b71a5a3218e4b6403.jpg"]],"transcount":16,"percentTranscribed":10,"date":[],"category":"Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

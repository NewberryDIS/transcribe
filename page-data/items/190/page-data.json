Abby, your description of your house and home was so god that I have formed a picture in my mind just how you look there. And I can imagine just how that corn cake tasted and I know just how your table looks when set for tea and it all seems so real. I think you have got nicely started in house-keeping. I think your rooms must be very pleasant indeed and that you must have a very happy home. And I also think from the number","0f41ea5e413319c92e447409ce13767f.jpg"],[43548,"number of calls you receive that you have found friends. Mr. Kendall, you wrote you were making preparations for house-building. That is an indication of prosperity. And notwithstanding you afirm your liabilities for $10'000, with your present good salary, your natural business talent, and your nice calculating house-keeper and faithful help-mate, I have no fears of any immediate disaster. I hope you will send me a plan of your buildings, I shall want very much to see it. Now, Abby, let us consider the more important and weightier information contained in your last letter. I congratulate you most sincerely upon prospects of further joy. In truth, we have hardly spoken of anything else, since we recieved the news. O' Abby if your prospects result favorably how happy you will be. Do be very careful of yourself every day of your life. For how much is depending upon a few","bcc0465e3e02260b289d53eda0710d04.jpg"],[43549,"short months. You can not be to careful, yet mother says a proper amount of exercise will be beneficial to you. Take things easy and dont worry yourself about one single thing. You and Mr. Kendall both have my warm thanks for the cordial invitation to visit you, and Abby nothing would give me greater satisfaction than to be with you now and during your sickness &c - Yet I hardly know what to say about it. It is so very unexpected I can hardly bring my mind to any concluion. Mr Kendall, I thank you for your very kind and generous proposals. It is no small item of consideration. And should I conclude to come, I should hope to meet you at the nearest possible station. But, Abby, this subject seems to need much consideration. Now let us look at it. In the first place should you be very much disappointed if I did'nt come? Secondly, would my presence and assistance be of sufficient value, to ballance the trouble and expense? written down left hand side of page you must not expect me so much, that you will be disappointed write me soon as you receive this all send love to you","991b60132f0ac3fea43f63b48e93de7a.jpg"],[43550,"If I go, as you have suggested my wardrobe must be entirely remodeled large additions made to it.

It seemed when mother died if I only could see you and Charles and talk with you it would be such a comfort. All day Saturday the day after mother died oh! how I wanted you Abby - I wanted a sister's constant welcome presence. And the night seemed oh! so long, and the days so lonely. I tried to have Emily stay but she thought she couldn't, and Chandler, good brother that he is, filled the place of brother and sister too, helping me make arrangements for our dear mother's funeral. Emily and Danford and Samuel and Maria were here all day Friday the day mother died.

When I had finished them she wanted I should bring them to the bed so she could see them - she looked at them awhile, said \"they would do\" and wanted I should wash them and have them ready -. She was perfectly calm and composed through her whole sickness, and spoke of dying as freely as if she had been going away on a visit. I never shall forget her many calm quiet christian conversations and expressions during her long sickness - And I am so thankful I was permitted to take care of her and watch over her, and administer to her wants even to the last moment of her life. Dear angel mother, she's gone, but there is a consolation in remembering how happy and peaceful her departure was, and in reflecting how perfectly willing she was to go, and how much she tried by her calm composure and with language none but pure christian lips could utter, to prepare us for her departure","689de8152e834ee4c199d838892498d5.jpg"],[43629,"Oh!

Then followed the sermon of the 14th Chapter of John Next the sermon, he had a written sermon, from this text \"Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead. And after that he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep\".

She was laid out very neatly in white muslin shroud with under-handkerchief, plaited neatly and folded across her pulseless bosom. And a neat but plain white muslin cap. Her coffin was nice, but plain. Her body was laid in the tomb. But Abby you never can know my utter loneliness after the funeral, and all was over.

Then in the cupboard stood the plate of food that I had got for her last supper, all untouched save one half a mouthful of pie - the other half still lying on the plate, recalling the words she said to me when I cut it off for her, \"Mary I can't eat, carry it away \" - tis my turn to shed the bitter bitter tears now, I'm left alone.","6014dac65e3e8b8ba1196c57574c75a0.jpg"],[43635,"9th\nAnd so hour after hour passed away, and day after day, and each day seemed more lonely than the last.

So Chandler and I in company with Mr Lincoln & wife went down We went to call on Mr. Reed's family, and they gave me such a cordial invitation and so kindly, insisted on my staying, that knowing how lonely my home seemed now, at length consented, so after the lecture which was rich they came home and left me. and I spent a very pleasant week there. which I will tell you more about whenI see you.

I thought I would be a very brave Little boy and not cry much after you went away, but I was obliged to cry once ever so much when Auntie Mary told me you would stay ten whole days and counted my fingers to show me how long. We did'nt mistrust how lonesome it would seem till after you had gone. I cried, and Winnie cried, and I guess Auntie Mary and Prince wanted to but thought they must'nt. I'm a good boy, Papa. Mamma, I'm a good boy. I dont run away at all. I did just go down to New kirks that morning you went away, but Auntie Mary called me back, and told me how lonesome she'd be with out me, now my papa and mama had gone and she should want ot see me very often and I must'nt go and leave her. And I told her I would'nt any more and I have'nt run away once since. I have'nt been out of the yard either scarcely at all. I did get over the fence a few times, but Auntie Mary tied a red string round my wrist and that helps me remember.","dbf5a4834cd1a8dfeee687e305d47c89.jpg"],[43658,"Auntie Mary takes me and Winnie and Prince out walking (Winnie rides though) every day sometimes twice a day, we go every where where there's good side walks. Last night while we were down to Uncle Charlie's store I saw Kane's great Esquimaux dog Myouk. He looked as if he was covered with bristles. I did'nt like him half as well as I do my noble Prince. And I saw a man with a seal-skin cap and Esquimaux robe, and he had a gun. I was afraid he was going to shoot Prince but Auntie Mary said he only pretended. Prince behaves very finely. He has'nt been naughty but once. Then he turned over the gingerbread jar and fereted out a card of gingerbread and run off with it. For which theft I didnt invite him in to the sitting room for a long time. But when he did come he held up his head and looked as though he had the best-end of the bargain after all. I play back-gammon with Auntie Mary and I beat once. Auntie Mary said I took after my Papa and Mamma. I read, and tell my little hymn and fold my hands and keep very still during \"Exercises\", and I guess I'm real good. Auntie Mary tells me I am and says I must grow up a real good nice man just like my papa, and I'm going to. I shall be very glad to see you when you come home, and will try to be very good because I love you so dearly and I know you like to have me a good boy - Now good bye my dear papa good bye my dear mamma. I ask God to bless you every night before I go to sleep. Here's a nice kiss for both of you, from your own darling little son Eddie.

Though I presume he thinks I can't beat him. He thinks he is the smartest because he beat Auntie Mary playing backgammon and brings here flowers and reads. But I'm smart too for I can creep and he could'nt when he was as old as I. I commenced my creeping excursions Monday, The way it happened, one of my play things rolled away and Auntie Mary was in the bed-room and I thought I would'nt call her, and Eddie was busy and I thought I'd get it my self. So I started with a determined zeal, and went and got it. True I keeled over when I got there, in my enthusiasm and Auntie Mary laughed enough to kill herself but I did it and knew I could again, and did'nt care. So Auntie Mary says we're both smartest. And I guess thats about right is'nt it? And I'm real good to, good as Eddie Auntie says, for I sit up to the table and don't cry to get accross the corner, but eat just like other folks. And at night I sleep just like a pussy Aunty Mary says and dont want any thing to eat till morning - I'm a good little boy and love my good papa and Mamma dearly.

You'd be surprised no doubt to see me wade through the water; mud, and snow, stopping to pull on my rubbers when the mud pulls them off &c.

Ive got quite used to it now and generally manage by jumping and leaping from bog to bog, or by taking two or three sticks of wood along to throw down \"for stepping stones in the deepest places, not to get much wet.

Mrs. Murray was very kind to me, she sent for me to come home with Mary and spend the night, and notwithstanding I was so hoarse, I had a very pleasant time. She is sort of a Home Physician of the Homeopathist order, and accordingly she dealt me out the little sugar pills, and gave me something in a liquid form and gave me a little phial of sugar pills to take to school and when I went to bed she came up to my room and put a wet bandage round my sore throat, and wrapped round plannel so tenderly so like my dear mother, (and kissed e good night) that I could'nt help shedding tears. I was a great deal better the next morning, but it rained in torrents, so she offered to go in my place (she having once been a teacher) but I said no! consequently the span of horses and carry all was brought to the door, and I and the girls packed in, and carried to school, and at night Mr. Murray came and carried me to my boarding place.

Mrs Murray a native of Boston, Educated at the Bradford Academy where Mary Hatch went one year. They resided in Chicago till last autumn. Then built a house on a farm he owns here and moved here. Mr Murray was civil engineer on the Michigan Central Railroad for some time. Is aquainted some, with Judge Niles and Mr. Hannah of Laporte. Afterwards was in a store in Chicago, is now a land ageent - I believe. Their house is well furnished and they seem to be good nice people. Mary has a very nice piano and plays very well indeed. They have a great many books several nice paintings in gilt frames, a Brussells carpet and a large stuffed rocking chair like yours, and other things to correspond They live one side of my school-house and Mr. Bailey's family the other. Mr. Bailey's family were from Danvill Ill. Last autumn. I've spent one night with them and called several times. Jennie has a piano and plays very well - And you know I enjoy music ever so much, we sing in school when ever I can find time. I only teach five days in the week. So you see I have every Saturday for my own use - Three Saturdays I have been to Chicago Once I went with Mr. Rexford to see about books &c. And once i went to meet Charles. He went in from La Porte on an Excursion trip, but it did'nt pass here - so he wrote me he was going and wanted I should meet him there. So I did, we had a nice visit. Took dinner at the Adams house close by the depot you know, after dinner I did a little shopping then we went down to the Central Park to see the skating. They had a Grand Carnival that afternoon led by a band of music. Enjoyed it ever so much. Then Charles came back here with me at night and we spend the Sabbath together, had a fire by ourselves and could talk over all we wished to. He had been very well for him all winter. But he took some cold that day in Chicago, down to the Skating park and I had rather a bad night Sunday night but was better in the morning, he left at 7 o'clock Monday morning on the Michigan Central. I enjoyed the visit, oh! so much! Last Saturday I went into Chicago in the morning and spent Saturday and Sunday with the family where I stopped last autumn when I was there. Sunday I attended the Congregational Church with them, and the Sabbath school in the afternoon. That I enjoyed very much indeed and returned here Sunday evening. There is no church in this place. There is {one two in Blue Island four miles from here, but I have no opportunity of attending. They are Baptist & Orthodox churches I think - I have attended one funeral here, a young man from Danville the same night and in the same car that I came in here Jan 3rd to visit at Mr. Baileys, was taken sick the next day, and never again went out of the house. He died in four weeks after he arrived. I attended his funeral - I have not heard from Warwick since I came here. I have not written. I'm going to write soon.

I went down to the Station early accompanied by Miss Bailey and carried a nice little bouquet of May-flowers to give you which I gathered the night before, May-Day you know. The first I've gathered this year. But when John Hentz handed me a letter the matter was explained. I'm so glad you wrote. I should have worried so if I had'nt have recieved it. Besides as I could'nt see you, your letter was the more welcome and seemed a sort of pacification. But then there was the bougquet, what should I do with that? Thinking that aloud, a little Canary in Mr Wards telegraph office immediately exclaimed \"Sweet! Sweet\", upon which I entered in to a more extended conversation with it and after satisfying me self by various questions that the little singing","0833901ad70af5d8dc612fd9d7ec9359.jpg"],[43671,"creature was fond of flowers by its invariable answer \"Sweet! Sweet! Beautifull-ll-ll\"! and by asking if the gift would be appreciated it repeated again \"Sweet! Sweet! Beautifull-ll-ll\"! so I bequeathed the bouquet to the little Canary, and Mr Ward assuring me that he and the bird were in company, hung it up in the cage amid a trill of thanks and ecstatic gestures from little Birdie. Sabbath Eve I commenced writing writing this morning - but I received an invitation to accompany Mr. Bailey, son & daughter, to a meeting Methodist I beleive, about five miles from here, and thinking it would be sort of a novelty I accepted - We found the roads rough so much so that we were obliged to go slow and did'nt arrive in season to attend the meeting, but we had a very pleasant ride back through groves and over the flowering prairie. It recalled those rides you gave us a year ago. But I kept thinking it was'nt you nor Abby nor Charles that was with me. I cant express the varied emotions that I experienced. I only know I felt myself a stranger in a strange but beautiful land - and","41566d7e0eb9f555b200feb6d7aa6af5.jpg"],[43672,"so Beecher-like yeilded to first impressions and indulged the caprices of impulse, till I could easily have imagined my self almost as delighted as he was at Stratford. For it was the Sabbath and somehow Nature seems more beautiful and lovely to me that day than any other. And to-day particularly she adapted herself to my feelings - and as neither of my companions appeared in a similar frame of mind I merely indulged in my own thoughts. Returning a friend of Mr Baileys invited us to take dinner with him, which invitation was accepted and we did'nt arrive home till about 5 o'clock - Last Sabbath I attended church in Blue Island. My school is very much as it was Last term. The classes are the same. But some of the older boys dont go although younger ones have come in so I number about forty pupils - My boarding-place I think will be much more favorable for me, on many accounts - it is nearer and I escape the wet prairie. And I shall make the very most of what material I have for enjoyment and try to be as happy as I can hoping for something better in the future. Is'nt that the best way?

But it was not going to be convenient for Mrs. B- to take me until two or three weeks certainly, and I finally engaged board here, (Mr. Baileys) for the summer. You will remember hearing me speak of them I dare say - It is much better for me to board here I think on many accounts. It is quite near the school house, and I escape the wet prairie which is quite as bad this summer as it was in the winter because every rain makes it wet as ever, beside the","0d2690a57e5a53e787c52169daf1df52.jpg"],[43675,"grass is growing and is already quite high, and the dew in the morning makes it wet and drabby and very unpleasant. And here I am as near my school-house as you are to your tenant-house and nearer I guess. The road is good and shaded with trees both sides. The family is large and Mrs. Bailey has a baby about as old as yours, and no help beside the family - that though is considerable. I have a very comfortable room adjoining the parlor about as large as your sitting-room fronting the garden and road. This I occupy a great deal when it is warm enough to sit without a fire. 'Tis quite a pleasant situation. The house stands back from the road about half as far as yours does and they have a very nice yard and gardens I think - It has had about 7 years cultivation. The yard in front of the house is green and full of little shade trees and some large ones two quite large pines (The two boys are laying on the ground under one of them now, several large cherry-trees now in full bloom large as yours at La Porte. Some little peach plum and pear trees also in bloom - some small spruces and pines large and small silver-leaf, and mountain ash trees and on one side a rather neglected hedge of arborvita There is a gravel walk down to the gate and borders of flowers on each side no great variety however, but round about","62322253148c0bc0df7784d0d26d961d.jpg"],[43676,"in the yard is some most splendid speciments of shrubbery I wish they were in your yard or some just like them. All kinds of roses I should think and thousands of them. Two great large rose bushes climb up the large square posts of the piazza and then they are round in bunches any where a great large - splendid Snow ball tree, Syringas, Lilacs, two in three great large bushes of climbing honeysuckles and another beautiful climbing-vine they call Washington's Bower, creeps up one side of the house, and right in front of my window is a beautiful little bush they call flowering currant, oh it is so fragrant, Did you ever see one, there I'm going to get a little sprig and press and send you - There I've got it but you wont have any idea of it without seeing and smelling it in the open air, The house has a right and left wing sort of queer but I guess pretty good plan, and the front yard has a right and left wing, and those are for fruit and vegetables some flowers and roses & vines? &c in one though, in one Bailey he has his hol=beds and transplants from, he has all sorts of vegetables. Yesterday we had Lettuce and radishes we've had pie plant and greens two weeks, is'nt it unclear Pease are 6 or eight inches high tomatoes early cabbages and corn &c as forward - Then he has several strawberry beds of different kinds early and late, white, red and black currants in abundance, white, red and black raspberry, ditto, English and common goseberry, Tame and wild plums, Isabella & Clinton grapes in extreme abundance, besides which he has an orchard of Apple, peach, pear, and cherry trees, all large enough to bear and now in full bloom. And that is on the other side of the front yard. That he plows and in that plants little cuttings to make other orchards and gardens - I went out this","e448b26f51d847ac858226165c06561d.jpg"],[43677,"morning with Mrs. Bailey to see them, and I declare such great long rows of currants peaches cherries plums raspberries, strawberries grapes, pease and everything else most ready to be transplanted it made me ache to pull every one of 'em great apple trees and all, up by the roots and send them all down to your house. I want you should have just such a nice garden, and you might have had by this time if they had taken any kind of care of it. Its a shame is'nt it! I suppose Mr. Bailey is raising a great deal of his fruit and vegatables for market in Chicago. He says he thinks 'Twill be more profitable than raising grain, and he thinks some of turning his whole farm into a garden and orchard You know I like every-thing that grows so I shall enjoy the garden the garden any how and I shall make the most of all other sources of enjoyment - Miss Jennie Bailey has an excellent piano and she plays and sings a great deal and very well. This I enjoy of course and she has kindly offered me the free use of her piano whenever I wish to practice and to assist me to, if I wish. I intend to avail myself of the opportunity what time I can spare, Then they have several horses and they ride horse back a great deal. I've rode once. Jennie & Mary Murray rode this morning. They ride very often and go like the wind on colts or any thing else - I had to have an old stump tailed madam, the mother of a dozen or two colts, saddled for me 'cause I'm inexperienced you know, and I could'nt fall off her because she was so broad in the flanks. I've had two or three buggy rides also, last Sabbath I went with Mr. Bailey, son and daughter about 10 or 12 miles to attend a meeting but was to late for the services - but the ride was very pleasant. The Sabbath before Jennie and William Bailey Mary Murray and I went to Blue Island to church These are the pleasanter parts, omit the opposites, - Mr. Rexfords folks started for California last Monday - I have heard some things since I came here of them that disgust me. But perhaps 'tis not true. I have met a branch of the Rexfords since I came back - Mrs - Stephen Rexford who was Miss Barber of Townsend ??-daughter of Mr. Barber who adopted Mr. Gleason of La Porte. She is also acquaint","b5554bc921f5a083911a8d88c822a363.jpg"],[43678,"with Mr. Raymond Kendall and Mrs. Weaver - Mr. Kendall will tell you all about it; her daughter was here when he was here on his way to La Porte. Has he returned home I expected he would be back here last Sat. and went down to the depot to see him and made him a little boquet &c. but I found a letter saying he did'nt know when he would pass here. I wrote him last Sunday but I have'nt heard from him since. And I've been thinking perhaps he went by land and started before he got my letter. I hope not for I've been anticipating his return ever so much. And if has gone I shall have no hope of seeing any body I know - I wrote Charles too last Sabbath, you to day, and I guess I shall write home next Sabbath. How have you got along while Mr. Kendall has been away - lonesome enough I dare say - Eddie I presume has mourned piteously. How is my little Winnie. Has he overcome the bad habbits Auntie Mary learned him. I Wish I could see the little fellow to day - Does he tease for the stories \"Old crow and the Fishes\" &c.? How is the baby? have you decided to call him George Marshall? How are the Chickens. How are The Dahlias? I couldnt get any for you They disposed of them all their flowers, almost at auction and among their relations what they did'nt sell. There is a man, Mr. Periam lives here on Blue Ridge who has a sort of nursery of flowers","2331bb6728f5daca8773cc4c3caa19c4.jpg"],[43679,"and keeps them for sale, the plants I mean, and some one told me he had 125 varieties of Dahlias if I was acquainted with him I would go up there and see if I could'nt get some for you - Two of his little girlls (sweet pretty too) go to my school. Tell Eddie they have a beautiful great Newfoundland dog just like Prince. And he comes to school with Mary and Ida, and came in to the school-room and laid down by their seat - I let him stay awhile, then he went out to play played with them at recess and when they came in, he came back into the entry and laid down till noon. His name is Saneu? and he brings their dinner basket to school for them and takes it home again. And I like him everso much because he looks just like Prince. My school is very much as it was in the winter except the large boys don't go and some more little ones do. Miss Murray and Miss Bailey attend so I have just as many classes as I did in the winter. Edwin Andrews son of that intemperate man and woman I told you about, one of my scholars last winter a young man 19 or twenty years old has left his home run away I suppose because his father & mother act so horridly. We have started a little sort of Reading Circle at Mr Murrays - Mr. Murrays proposition. We've read twice from Ruskins Typical Beauty or The Beauties of Nature. I think of you and Mr. Kendall every time and how much he would enjoy it. Mr Cooper one of the directors has has had a windfall from the Old Country of $50,000, worth having is'nt it. He is soon to start after it - Mr Bailey was speaking about your section of Country one day, and I told him I thought there was yet some land in your vicinity that was not yet entered - He thought it could'nt be possible! So there or is there not? Wont you ask Mr. Kendall? There good-bye - Write me soon won't you and tell Mr. Kendall if he is at home, I wrote him in La Porte and he must write me Perhaps they'll send it to him but tis'nt worth that trouble. Good-bye I hope you are all well and happy - You must take all the comfort you can, when you can yours truly - Mary -","342e6e122f4ace27a3f3ce23e0fcee09.jpg"],[43680,"Hope, June, 28th 1863\nDear, Mr. Kendall:\nAre you in La Porte to-day? then here's a word of greeting for you. - I have been talking to Charles, and I would like to talk a little while with you. Your short visit of last Saturday, did me so much good. I felt all the stronger in the line of duty, for seeing you. I have since thought that, perhaps, I too ungenerously demanded your sympathy, in communicating to you all my causes of anxiety, and sources of solitude, If so, you must excuse it for the reason that it had just come to my knowledge, and with such sudden force, as almost to overwhelm me with the tumult of my own emotions. I hope, however, my fears for infection are all groundless. Yet I am not sure. I shall, and have, taken measures of precaution most strictly - and shall keep thoroughly fortified, until I'm very sure 'tis unnecessary. How did you find Abby and the little boys? I can imagine how all the hours passed away? When did","a4a5e5ba095c954f4e740fc4d82c718b.jpg"],[43681,"you leave home for La Porte, if you have left? How did you enjoy the journey over the country? How is your health? How are your farm affairs progressing? Your hedge, and your fruit? &&c. I did'nt have time to ask you last Saturday. How are you spending this beautiful day, and how did you spend the more lovely evening, last evening? I can guess. You were riding last evening, round that same beautiful lake, which you recalled to my memory in your letter, the time, and place a never-to-be-forgotten reminiscence to me. Yes indeed, I do remember it! How very lovely it was that evening. - The silvery moonlight resting on the placid bosom of the lake, save when a gentle breath of the evening zephyr slightly ruffled its silver surface, then \"broke its ripples into stars.\" There was where you was last night, witnessing the, the \"moon-beams and shadows waltzing among the trees.\" To-day you are riding out round Pine Lake and pllashing through the cool water by the shore - I'm there too. Can you see me? No, the spirit is invisible. But with the pictures memory has painted and hung up in her picture-gallery, and your last letter before me, 'tis easy to imagine myself again in those beautiful places. And how it gilds the cares and trials of to-day; to recalls the happy house of the past. What a blessing to be created with hearts, and souls,","3ef1e2b33a857535fe288d7cf228e76e.jpg"],[43682,"capable of so intensely feeling, and realizing the pure joy, and harmony abounding in Nature. Oh! I would not, that the organs of perception were less keen, or the power of emotion less strong, although that very keenness of perception, and strength of emotion may often cause intense pain and anguish. Would you? Where, the use of being surrounded by everything lovely, if in our own souls, and hearts there is no mirrors of reflection? And what the value of the mirror, if it be not kept bright, and polished by the using? How I would like to be with the good and pure and beautiful all the time - Perhaps I sometimes am, when I gon't know it. But somehow, I have lately lost so much confidence in the world, that is, there are said to be so many evil people in the world, that I feel a sort of distrust, for all, and everything save save those I have long known and tried. A needless feeling no doubt, yet no less true. And for that reason, I keep very close, and quiet here. Only going to Mr. Murrays, and to meeting occasionally. There has been an arrangement made to have a meeting in my school-house ocasionally - The minister from Blue-Island comes over. We have had a meeting there twice. O! yes, one other place I go..

I was very lonely of course after you all departed. And in the round of duties I commenced \"setting things to rights\". I picked up the children's play things, and wept, alternately - occasionally when something in particular appeared of my little Winnie's I would sit down to a regular \"boo, hoo\". Singular it seems to me, how I have loved that child. Well the1st day passed and I carried all the little play things away, but left the cradle a few days longer - Friday every-body deserted the house but myself - Mr - & Mrs Lincoln went to Athol and Chandler to Boston - He Chandler reveived a letter of urgent business the night, (Thursday) after you left, requiring immediate attention, so he started for Boston Friday morning - And as he was obliged to go then he remained and visited until the next Tuesday and will not now go to accompany Rhoda & Eva home. written down left hand side of page Please remember me kindly to Lydia - Tell her I think she better go west with you - She has been teaching long enough to rest and the journey will do her good - Is the baby better - I hope you will all be well and happy good-bye Mary - 'Tis the most forward beautiful Spring here I ever knew - I presume would send love or something if he was awake -","9f48b01b44a3549d4f7e4f09f117ac22.jpg"],[43703,"Monday after you left I commenced our Village School. Hattie Goldsbury continued unable, and I was at length induced, by offer of good compensation &c. to teach the school. So of course you must know I've not had much spare time since. I have forty-five pupils - I teach only five days in a week and Saturdays I churn! Wash, and bake, and have been cleaning the chambers {and working in the grden that time I had beside, in connection with the other ordinary domestic duties. It keeps me exceedingly busy, but we get along nicely - When we have warm meat dinners, I get every thing ready in the morning on and in the stove and Chandler comes in and kindles a fire at a certain time and starts things cooking, and when I get home it is all ready to take up on the table. But you know these were numberless I had left to be done after you had all gone, when I thought I was going to have so much time - So the 1st Saturday after I commenced. I did'nt have time to bake all I wanted to, and prepared everything for baking Monday night after school - In the mean time we were going to subsist on \"what was left\", with what I might cook as a woork of necessity on Sunday - Well, Monday night came, and it was announced to my perceptive faculties, at quarter past five that I was to have a visitor to tea - Here was a dilemma!

The draft is still going on, you know, all around us - fourteen men have been drafted from this town the names you may have seen and only six accepted, the remaining ones to be replaced by an additional draft, the names of which are expected here to night - Chandler has gone to hear the result now. As yet Chandler and Samuel have not been drafted - but I so much fear they will be. Towns people and the select men are expecting themselves to raise subscriptions and procure substitutes - but it is very uncertain if we obtain them - Several of the Warwick boys have been wounded in the recent battles and two reported killed - one of which is Joseph Sawyer that lived with Chandler, you know. The other was a Henry Mason a newcomer. Mr. Lincoln's sone Sumner was slightly wounded and came home on a thirty days furlough - walks with a crutch - Mrs Lincoln and he have gone to Fitchburg & Vicinity on a short visit. So Mr Lincoln is keeping house alone. He goes to Jamaica on exchange next Sabbath and Mr. Perkins of Winchester is coming here, and we shall have him to Entertain among other things.

During which, I lost his idea of managing one's husband. He raised his fist and I thought he said, \"some thought best to take your fist to him\", (setting the action to the word) but Jennie Tyler said she thought he said \"Take a stick to him\" all the same thing anyhow. His idea, of course, was that love was the remedy. In bringing up children also - so you see I commenced sight with Winnie - One beautiful idea of the facts of love around us he expressed in this wise, \"The world at our feet, the brother at our side, Heaven before us, and God overhead\", making an atmosphere of love surrounding us. Beautifully expressed is'nt it - But then, how Orange people can have Sabbath-day worship with him as a leader I can't conceive - Chandler has come home and says the report is that the Select-men who are now in Boston have obtained the necessary substitutes for the remaining men to be drafted from this town.

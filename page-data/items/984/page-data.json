Justice Harlan\nU.S. Agent for Cherokees\nSir\nPermit me very respectfully to state that is the wish of the Cherokee Nation to make the expenditure for supplies during the present defficulties as small as possible. With the best management and the most limited supply that will keep the People from great suffering and even from starvation the expenses will run up to a most frightful sum.. We deem it our duty under these circumstances to curtail the expenditure in every possible respect.\nIn the opinion of the National Executive there is no absolute necessity for furnishing the People with beef under contract. The great number of men procuring cattle in our country for various public purposes has been one of the pretexts under which this country has been stripped of its Stock. Though in lone instances it may cause inconvenience to the few living around this Post we","7649efa61e5334676cd08eddb30dcf67.jpg"],[62931,"that no more beef be furnished by the contractor. It is only a very few in the immediate viccinity of Fort Gibson who can draw the beef their furnished while the great mass of our People, living at their homes cannot share it.\nI also notice large quantities of Tobacco and salt has been brought here by the contractor. Salt we can make ourselves at our own unclear-labors? and profer? that the expense of furnishing it be not incurred.\nMarkhaus Salt Works will be put in operation by the national Authorities in the course of a few days. Tobacco is one of these useless articles upon which enormous profits are realized. And those who are foolish enough to use it ought to pay for it. It is so far from being a necessity that I do unclear-caues? the? protest against incuring expense in procuring it and ask that Tobacco be excluded from the unclear\nAnd in general I request that only absolute necesities be furnished. We would greatly prefer that the entire expenditures for furnishing destitute Cherokees with food be devoted to the procurring of Horse and corn on the most favorable terms possible.

He has fought this host of speculators and robbers and thieves to the utmost of his ability. But his command is limited. He has not even the Command of the whole Cherokee Nation. And one of the Indian Regiments is taken out of his hands; and is crippled in every effort to do us justice, as well as save the Government from losses. Speculators, thieves etc? have raised a hand against him and tried break him down.

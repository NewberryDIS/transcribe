The rebs are very spareing of their ammuniton, they do not fire unless it is to some purpose consequently we have but few men wounded. Our Regt. has lost but one killed, and three wounded since the day of the charge.

Also the 130th Ills. and 48th Ohio were up to the fort. Two guns from the Mercantile Battery were within fifty yards of there pouring in canister with a will, When our forces were driven back there were not Batty. men enough to bring away the guns. so rather than loose them, they brought them to the top of the hill and started","aa2f5f6538a676ba806daae58890a95e.jpg"],[51722,"them down, the hill was so steep, that they went down with fearful velosity, sometimes one side up and sometimes the other with but little damage to the gun carriages.

Levi Davis being under arrest, the cause of his arrest I do not exactly know. He is very low spirited about it. The report has just come into camp that Gen. McClernand has been relieved of his command, I hope it is not so, for he is liked by his Army.

He seemed quite cheerful, said that he was not seriously wounded. He was a deserter from the Regt. at Napolean and returned in May to escape the penalty of a deserter. He is severely punished wheather it is for the crime of desertion or not.

We had made seventy two miles just as day light began to dawn upon us we coming round a bend and were emerging from the timber when I heard a shrill whistle which awakened me from a sound sleep, for I was very tired, and slept although cramped in sitting posture. It seemed to me almost instantanious, the whistle and the crash of the engine, against the other train for it had run into the train of the 54th Ind. Their engine had been disabled so that the engineer had to go to Algiers for another and  the Conductor had neglected to send out a signal light When I heard the first","8c619da4eed9a441f97770960b3a1b61.jpg"],[51792,"crush I comprehended there was some danger, and jumped for the car without looking to see where I was jumping to. I lit on solid ground but instantly fell forward in to a ditch full of water head foremost. I had hardly raised to the top when some man piled on top of me knocking me undr. the second time, when I got out I saw my blanket and cap laying in the water, and the cars all a wreck front of me. The scene that then occurred makes my blood run cold to think of, and so nervious that I can hardly write. I have heard the prayers and groans of the wounded on the battle field, but never before heard anything so heart rending. I did not stop to secure any of my cloths, my first thought was to help the wounded, I think that I strained myself more lifting to relies them than by the fall. The engine did not go more than half way through one car of the front train and then stoped doing but little damage to the engine. The third car can under the platform, and over the wheels of the second car riping it up edgwise. The fourth, fifth, and sixth, ran upon the third, leaving the wheel of four cars in one pile on Comp. H's car. As soon as our car got fairly upon the third it tiped up edgwise slueing the men into the ditch filled with water which was on the oposite side from which I jumped. Every car that was filled with Soldiers was smashed all to peeces, while all those behind were not damaged at all. It mad the disaster a great deal worse haveing so much heavy freight behind. The engineer says that he saw the train about tow hundred yards before he came to it, but supposed it was the station house, as it was between him and the house and did not find out his eror untill within fifty yards, when he done all in his power to save us, by reversing the engine and puting on the breaks, and then jumped to save his own life.

I was struck with the difference in the people here, and at New Iberia, here the devotion was sutable to a Church they joined in the prayer for our Country, and for our President with out any such outward demonstrations as were enacted","b63c434f64177684583bd1ec41abab53.jpg"],[51798,"at Iberia.

Boreman of our Company had been on that post and was partialy drunk. He is now under arrest awaiting for a trial.

Had they gone out of the gate at that time of night they would have been seen by our boys, as it is on the street and some of us are loafing around there nearly all the time.

He asked me if I had a pass and where I belonged. I told him that","9f01626ff7440c72a79bf36cfd744fbe.jpg"],[51814,"was my business not his. He then told me to come along with him, and he would show me whoes buisness it was. So I marched along very quietly until I got to our gate when I steped inside and told the Sentinal not to pass them in. At first the Sergt. was awful mad and threatened to report me, but his men laughed at him and told him to take it as a joke. So finaly he owed that he was Sold, and treated to the Oysters.

McClernand in this Department, as he was a man who could not bear to be inactive himself, or to see any one else so. The last expedition towards Texas had to wait three days for Jintry preses Much to the chagrin of the 13th A.C. commander Of course it was a Military necesity. Gen's.

There is great rejoicing throughout the entire Corps. At the return of their old commander, for as long as he is in command the boys can have more priveledges than under any other man I know of. Capt. Ochenbach has resigned and gone home, do not know what his reasons were for doing so, but presume it was because he go no promotion. This never will bring Howard in as Captain much to the dissatisfaction of most of the members of the company.

There are three Companies from the Regt. doing duty here beside the Recruits from Company G. If we could have our own officers and all the company here I should like it better than in the heart of the City, but to be way out of the world in the subberbs of the great City, with but few associates makes it somewhat lonesome, and I do not have enough to do to keep my mind occupied. All there is for me to do is to look out for the interests of the men, and see to drawing their Rations. We have seven hundred and fifty Prisoners under guard here, about the finest looking set of Rebs. I have ever seen, they have plenty of good food to eat, and good quarters to stay in. The treatment of these men compared to our poor men in Richmond is so great that","6da35f6b5861ce06db358a1adef5c2a4.jpg"],[51841,"it makes my blood boil to hear any of the Southern Chivalry talk. The papers are being made out for exchange of the bigest part of the men here: there are some here who would sooner be held prisoner than to be exchanged and go into a land of starvation, nearly one half of them would take the Oath of Alliegance but that will not be administered to them unless they will join our Army. There was a time when I thought that they ought to be allowed to take the oath and set at liberty, but now my mind is changed, let them either fight for or against his Country, they had better be fighting against us: than to be among us and laying plots to destroy the Government. Your letter of March 21sth with Katies Photograph enclosed was received last night it was handed me by one of the boys after I had gone to bed, you asked for my opinion of the picture before reading the letter, that I can not give you, for I had read the letter to when you said you had sent the picture before I knew it was there.

The Regiment made a very good appearance, was highly complimented by Governor Yates and General Benton both of which made us a speech the Governors speech was quite lengthy, but not at all tedious, the Generals speech was short and spicy, keeping the audience in a roar of laughter all the time he was speaking. Gen. Benton is an Indianian a regular Rip Snorter some thing like old A. J.

One from Johnny Beck, mailed at Alton June 24th it covered two sheets of letter paper written in small hand, giving me a detailed account of his experience in the last three months.

Our retreat from five Mile Creek was accomplished on the 13th Inst. Although I was able to march, Lt. Col. Vifquain took pity on me, and ordered me in our Ambulance, which most assuredly was a great assistance, for in many places the water was so deep as to make high top boots a poor preventative against wet feet. Beside the Colonel Drs. Davis and Smith have taken great interest in me to keep me from unnessary exposure. So that I am now getting rearly better that I have before for months. For the last four or five days have taken no medicine, and done all my duty. The timber here is all Pitch Pine and the Dr. thinks that the smoke is beneficial to my desease.

Then the idea of disgraceing myself and family, when I could do nothing to recompence myself for it, immediately dispels the thought. So I will strugle on, and keep myself in as good cheer as possible, for in less than eight short months shall be clear from the Army, and by that time am in hopes that there will be no more need to peril ourselves for the sake of the dear old flag, which so many of our brave boys have fought and died to save from being trampled under foot.

Well I left the Camp of Distribution in N.O. on the 29th of Dec. had under my charge 16 men mostly Substitutes and drafted men with orders to turn them over to the Provost Marshal at this place. When I arrived here and turned the men over to the Provost Marshal, he gave me orders to take charge of eight of them and proceed to five mile creek and report them to their respective Regts. In a rough way he said he wanted me to execute the order if I had to go to Mobile to do it, the last order I barely escaped putting in to effect. Thus we started, nine of us without a gun, pistol or hardly a bowie knife, in a strange country, with no idea of the roads, or the direction that we were to take from all the information that we could gain from Soldiers at this place we were to keep to the right hand road, which road was not cut up by baggage trains, on account of there being so many mud holes but that the Infantry had traveled it for it was some nearer. We started out pretty brash for all were anxious to get to camp, the road ran nearly due East and nearly all the time in sight of the Sound We marched untill we thought we had gone a long six miles which distance they told us it was when we came in sight of a small town, and could see the camp fires, and horses picketed out to the trees for we were not over a fourth of a mile off. For some cause I was a little suspicious which made me a little cautious. I advanced cautiously untill I got behind a clump of bushes where I could have a fair sight of them, and sure enough there were no blue coats there nothing but Confed Cavalry. One thing is certain we beat a hasty retreat, and many a glance was cast behind to see if any one followed us. When we arrived back here again was told seven miles down the Sound there was a nest of Rebels quartered in a small town which had never been broken up We cooked a little Coffee and had a bit of fat Pork roasted on a Stick after which we again started for camp and arrived there first before dark That trip was a hard one for me and I did not get over the effects of it for a week, but now am getting like myself again gaining my strength fast.","1afeba953f651e516732794694f41b90.jpg"],[51910,"Hd.

The most I can now say is, that we are rappidly approaching their works by entrenching. For the last hour there has been one of the heaviest bombardments on our extreme left. Near or at Fr.

Our loss must surely have bee heavy for our men were three lines deep. We have always supposed that when Ft.

Before going further will tell you how it is customary for an Army to March. The Cavalry always take the lead and if any enemy in the rear, also the rear is protected by them. With two or more Div. of Inft. the advance Div. to day takes the rear to morrow and the same with Brig'.s and Regts. the advance Brig. takes the rear of its Div. and the Regt. of its Brig. The last Brig. usualy guarding the Div. train, one Regt just in the advance, one behind and the others as flankers, or if not practable to travil beside the waggons each Regt. is assigned so many waggons and marches between them. My Notes commences on leaving Pensacola March 20th. Left Pensacola early this morning for a wild Goose chase through the country, and for my part have but little confidence of success. Our force consists of two Brigades of the 13 A.C. and one Dive of three Brig. of Colored Inft. and three Regts. of Cav. then there are four more Cav. Regts. gone up the Bay to embark at Milton making in all a force of about fifteen thousand men With five days Rations in Haversack and six on the waggons. Our Regt. was on train guard, which consists of one hundred and fifty waggons. The Country is low flat and sandy the waggons would mire down, so that we had to put our shoulder to the wheal frequently to help the out. After making eleven miles we were tired enough to go into camp. 21st Was again on the road by day light Marched","70653d981565244744d2df6c1f9890bf.jpg"],[51940,"six miles through a drenching rain and went into camp by 8 A.M. As there had been a heavy fall of rain all night it was utterly impossible for the waggons to get through. The Country a little more rolly, but a treacherous quick sand lies under the soil. 22nd Our Div. laid in camp to let the Colored troops pass. Weather clear and cool. 23rd Took up our line of march at 10 1/2 A.M. Our Regt. just in the advance of the train marched ten miles, had to make several stops to Corderoy the worst places in the roads. Arrived in camp by dark The country more hilly, with occasional signs of civilization. The change in the scenery from barren Pines to the more enliving foliage of the Oak, Ash, and the blossoms of Peach, Plumb, Cherry, Red bud and dog wood is an agreable one. One great blessing we have is good water and plenty of it. 24th laid in Camp until about 5 P.M. when we moved our camp across Pine beaver creek, although the deepest of it had been pontooned ye we had to wade through the water nearly waist deep 25th Was on the road by a little after day light marched twenty miles and went into Camp near the Escambia river a little before dark. We went into Camp by 1 P.M. but had hardly got our Knapsacks off when the order came to fall in as we were wanted to the front. By a flank movement our Col. got the 97 in the advance and for six miles we made a forced march making but one halt of about five minutes. The Cav. fight ahead but we could not get up to them, they done some good","38b27efca6988d90c815ba7cf6734173.jpg"],[51941,"fighting capturing 1 General (Mortaly wounded) 1 Col. 1 Maj. and 150 men. The showe signs of hard fighting and a hasty retreat on the part of the Rebs. it being strewn with Knapsacks, Haversacks, Guns and any and everything that would impede their flight. 26th The Inft. of the 2nd Brg crossed the river as soon as they could see, and mad a forced march to Pollard, a small town at the junction of the Montgomery and Mobile with the Blakely and Pollard R.R. where we had heard there was a small rebel force. By some means our Col. always succeeds in getting the 97 in the advance when there is a prospect of a fight. The town was surrounded and the whole force advanced on it at once, but there was nary [previous word underlined] Reb there, hearing of our advance they had Skedadeled. [previous word underlined] after destroying the R.R. track for some distance and burning several public buildings we returned to our Division. In the Rebels retreat they had destroyed the main road bridge over the river so that we had to cross on the stringers of the R.R. Bridge and only footman could pass. One peculiarity of this country is that hills after rising on elevation of an hundred feet, water can be found within two, or three feet of the surface, and in many places flows over the top of the ground. 27th We have now changed our direction and are marching towards Blakely Our Regt is train guard It rained all day did not get into camp until near Mid Night, and then made only about twelve miles. We are now reduced to half rations Considerable being thrown away from waggons that broke down The slowness of our movements, and Prisoners being fed make it nessary to economise. 28 The 97 in the advance of the Div. marched twelve miles and went into camp early 29th marched ten miles was rear guard to the train passed through one swamp that had to be corderoyed for three miles dureing the day over five miles of corderoy had to be made commenced raining at noon and rained all the after noon and at night it fell in torrents completely flooding the camp.

A hevy fire was kept up all night doing us no damage however 3rd Early in th we retired to an adjicen hollow to cover us from the enemys fire our position being to much exposed. A heavy canonading was kept up all day by the Rebs, wounding one man in the 97 4 Rather quiet during the day until 5 P.M. when our Batteries opened a terific bombardment, on Ft.

Well at about 5 PM on the 9 Inst. the order came to fall in, and then every one knew that there was a charge to be made, from the appearances of things I had made up my mind that such was to be the case soon after dinner we mad our way to our advance rifle pits, which is a good fine hundred yards distant from the rebel works, while we forming in the pits Capt. Wisner of Co. D. stept upon the bank in the rear of the pits and was walking along close by where I stood when he steped on a torpedo which exploded","51353f938b4d0956543f519ed561480a.jpg"],[51949,"completely severing his right leg from his body at the knee. The lines stood four deep in the pits, the 24. Ind. in the advance on the right of our Brig supported by the 76th IA. and we in the advance on the left supported by the 69 Ind.

I then advanced fifteen or twenty steps when I saw a man fall a little to my left and I had started for his gun when a musket ball took me in the leg. At first I thought it was a spent ball and was going on but had proceeded but a few steps when I fell and could go no farther then on examination it was found that the ball had passed clean through the fleshy part of the leg and was bleeding profusely. After creeping back to a little to a less exposed position I laid and watched the lines as they advanced to the parapets. I claim that our colors was second to none in being planted on the parapets. As far as I could see and that was through the two Brigades. I have sent you a N.O. of the 10 with an article on the taking of the place, the writer gives us no credit whatever, but speaks in the highest praise of other Rgts in the Div. One thing is certain we lost heavier than any other according to our numbers. We loosing sixty two I think, out of less than four hundred in the charge.

I have never explained the cause before to any one, and I do so to you because you know well enough to understand the motives that (a word I can not make out) me. After Annie and I had exchanged vows in order that she might not doubt my motives I told her that it was herself, [previous two words underlined] and not what she might inherit that I wanted. In proof of which I told her that if ever she became my wife she must look to me for a fortune and not to her father that I could not would not marry anyone that was","e3a316d2c37a80808cc59adcf319d322.jpg"],[51983,"better off in the worlds goods than I was. That I was young and strong and could soon place her (my own expectation) upon a social equality with her brothers I pointed out to her what a sacrifice she would have to make. That I could not sacrafice an inate principal. I would die first. I then asked her if she was ready to make the sacrifice. She said she was. All this transpired (though not just in the words) before I considered our engagement binding and so the matter rested till a short time of the time when was to have been celibrated our nuptuals; when I received a letter (which I will not pretend to quote) expressing regret that she had ever entered into a contract which would compell her to sacrifice all she had in the world. And as though nothing had transpired on the subject warned me that if I married her I would get a peniless bride. I read the letter and these two thoughts fixed themselves in my mind. Eather she had loved me but now ceased to do so, or that she had never loved me - and was acting coquetting. I was inclined to give heed to the first thought but let which one would be true if she was coquetting with me a knoledge of that fact would drounded out any love I had borne her. I could not brook an insult so direct if she had ceased to love me and was tired of the engagement. Of course the part of a gentleman would compell me to set her free. I did it in a tender language as I know how to use. In answer to which she told me We meet henceforth as strangers the note admitted of no reply. So the thing stood. Annie has been away a long time. She got home last week. I meet her hast night I would have spoken to her but she passed me by in a manner which showed to me that if she had ever felt any love for me it is all gone. Henceforth we must be strangers not that it is my wish but because such treatment renders it necessary. I still have the most tender feeling for the little wayward girl but love her again think I never could. My prayer to heaven for Annie is that she may get some one that is more worthy of her than I am for at best I am but a poor specimen of humanity. R. B. Crossman. I have now wrote you all he told me. I appears to me that you are some what in the fault, but I hope not. Don't mention that I wrote this to you for he may not like it.

September 2d, 1864, My Beloved Sister, Having a few spare moments to myself, which I have not had before for the last 3 days I will attempt to answer your letter, also the note you enclosed in [Mollie?] Gelders letter. Day before yesterday we received orders to be ready to march at a moments warning. Consequently I was very buissey all day, trying to get away some sick, which took me all day. And at night I was very tired and sore from riding back and forward to Head Quarters. And on yesterday I had to post up my books and make out my monthly report. To day I feel some better that I have been for the last two days. On last eve. the orders we received the day before were countermanded and now we are ignirat when we will leave this place. We may go in a day or two or it may be weeks before we leave. Where we will next turn up I know not. Some think at Atlanta 'Yea.\" Others Memphis or there abouts. I fact: no one knows any thing about the movements, or destination, but should we leave and as soon as I have time I will let you know our where abouts. I reced your &amp; Mother letters last evening. Several of the boys reced letters stating the death of William Smiths \"father.\" Willie also received one. At the time the mail came Billy was out on Picket and we all thought best not to send out the letter to him as their were no sergant that could relieve him from duty. He came in from Picket this morning and they gave him his letter. I have just been over to see him, poor fellow he takes it very hard. The letter he reced was wrote by","f3a6402630cc612192b1a6fc5e7a4d92.jpg"],[51989,"Mrs Mitchell. She did not write full particulars. I presume he soon will receive one from his Mother or Sister. I let Billy read your letter, also Mothers. He desired me to give you all his love and is thankful to you all for your sympathy. He &amp; I are now alike both fatherless. I know by experience what he now suffers and oh would it were in my power to give him the consolation which he so much needs, but it is not. All I can do is to sympathize with him and pray that the time is not far distant when we both may go \"home\" to those loved ones that are left. It gives me much sorrow to hear of Sister Lee's illness. I hope &amp; pray that her life may be spared for Brothers sake. And I truly hope she is recovering, do not fail to let me know all in regards to her illness for I fear, anxious to hear form her. The trouble I have had with Maggie does not in the least greave me for I look on the bright side and think myself fortunate in escaping as I did the foul snares the bound me to her. Yet I grieve very much when I think of home and the loved ones there. \"No then I feel home sick.\" Tis then when my thoughts are of \"him\" whom ever was dear to me, but now his soul is resting in peace. And sooner or later we must all follow. And I hope and pray we may all be prepared to meet our God when he sees fit to call us from this unhappy world. And there in his bliss full abode I hope to meet our \"father\" whom has gone before us. Very often I get to thinking of home and have the blues. Then I will get up from my seat and sneak around annoying the boys and appear joy trying to drive all those thoughts which enter my mind and cause me to feel so sad. It is no use of wishing to be home for it is impossible for to get there. It soon","80f804ece7ae4f39da22904b8cdd4eef.jpg"],[51990,"will be the 8th of this month, and then in one year we will be mustered out of the service. It is true we have been in the army over two years but we have to be in three years from the time we were mustered into the Regiment, which was on the 8th of September 1862. On the 22d of this month is my birthday. It will make the third birthday I have spent in the army and I hope by the next one I will be at home. Dear Sister while in New Orleans some one stole the little needle case you and Lee made me. They stole it out of my room. I think the fellow that stoled it is mean enough to do anything. Arnt you?

Imagination carried me back to the old Elm Farm, to the morning that I came from Aunt Putney's and they told me I had a little brother, which I found to be a fact when I saw him lying on a chair in the west room of the old shop, after that I took care of that little brother in the new house. He was my baby while Sister Carrie was Lydia Morrison's as we played company under the \"Oil nut\" tree. Three years later and he was for the first time a scholar in that same west shop room","286c251fe186731995e1f9c738a739ee.jpg"],[52023,"in which he was born, in a juvenile class with Henry Clark Warren Floyd Warren Straw, and never shall I forget how proud I felt when one day Miss Hannah Currier came into the school to visit it and Miss Hannah Sargent our teacher, as the little class was called and went through their ricetations / The questions were Who discovered America? Where was Columbus born? etc. etc. Miss Currier asked our teacher what little boy is that at the head of the class who answers so promptly? Query Did that same little brother early receive first idea of military life with the little wooden gun which Esther Straw gave him, not from any special love to him but because she gave the rest one? One of my pleasantest recollections of my dear brother is that always when he prepared to go to meeting he came","e8af063168f94094063e1feb7687bc00.jpg"],[52024,"to me with Luthy \"comb my hair\" or Luthy tie on my ribbon, and do you remember that your first trial at driving old Kate was to take me to my school up to Rowells Bridge? Is it not pleasant to dwell on these early recollections? but the unbidden tear will start as memory tells us not to stop here, the first great event in our family the oldest leaves to push her way in the world in a distant state, then the whole family leaves the oldes homestead and moves still farther away. these changes are not enough. Death that unwelcome messenger claims the Father as his own, a few more years of joys and sorrows and our dear Mother is laid by our Father's side. But this heavy cloud has its silver lining God took our dear Parents to himself as we trust","55fcf132c40cedec015882593c828e54.jpg"],[52025,"these evil days had come, Oh what a lesson do these ever constant changes of joy and sorrows teach us, and shall we turn a deaf ear to these teachings no rather would we be diligent to make our calling and election sure. Dear brother will you not, also (if you have not already don so) enlist in the Christian warfare under the Captain of our Salvation fight the good fight of faith, and come off conqueror over the great enemies of our soul the world the flesh and the devil? Will you not when you write to me speak freely of your feelings, whether you have or have not made Jesus your friend? Most especially do you need him now exposed to the dangers hardships privations and temptations of a soldier's strict morality does very well against temptation as far as it goes but it is not a sufficient security. Many Christian people seem to be now aroused to the importance of earnestly beseeching our Heavenly Father to guide and protect our Country in peril May he take special care of you my dear brother and my you acknowledge him in all your ways is the desire and prayer of your Sister Lucy L.

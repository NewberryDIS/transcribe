I have thought of you often very often, & have daily intended to write you but I have not been well & have also been busy indeed. I am some better better than when I last wrote you but still I am very far from being well.  My lungs have been & still are troubling me some & then I have so much [unclear] I am so exceedingly nervous.  But Abby dear I should be so glad to see you & if nothing happens different from what I expect I shall be with you four weeks from today.  I hope to be better then than I am now.  If I am not perhaps you will\nc68","00b108531528d583e3b917dd384502e0.jpg"],[39556,"prefer having out marriage postponed.  Tell me Abby dear just what your wishes are upon the subject.  I intend to be governed in this manner entirely by your wishes, & what you think best.  My own wishes are that our marriage should take place at the time we have proposed, but still if I am to be an invalid I do not think our marriage will add much to your happiness. You shall decided this matter however, & you must be sure & do it in your next letter. I am greatly obliged to you for your kind invitation to spend a week in Maple Grove previous to our marriage, but it will be entirely out of the question from the fact that I have many relatives in Royalston, [unclear], Phillipstone, & Petershaw who would feel very hard towards me if I","3be6dd0611356230c1760e3c77bb4395.jpg"],[39557,"should spend a week at Harwick & then not visit them, & it would be impossible to call even upon them in less than another week, & the limited times that I can be absent would not allow me to do this & t the same time spend any time on out way out here. There is another reason Abby dear which has with me much force. I am all worn out & I want to be rested while I am gone, now it would be utterly impossible for me to rest an all if I spend one week visiting with your folks & one with my on.  For me to visit is anything but to rest.  When I return home I shall of course have much to do & I want to return with fresh vigor.  The journey I have proposed will allow me to make frequent stops, & will","e54eea2b772d3dce9f0e4333fad35bd0.jpg"],[39558,"refresh & rest us rather than tire us. I am exceedingly anxious to take the southern tour from the fact that we may never have another opportunity to take such a trip.  It will not be very expensive for upon the R.R. as I have passes.  I want you should take the trip for I think you would enjoy it & it would do you good.  I know I should enjoy it & that it would do me a world of good.  I want to descend the Hudson River in a steam boat by day for its scenery is as fine as any in the world.  I want to cross the Alleghenies on the Baltimore & Ohio R.R. for the scenery on that road is very wild.  I want to spend two days between Washington & Wheeling.  I want to spend the 1st night at Harper's Ferry & the 2- at Cumberland.  In Harper's Magazine for April is a description of the route.  I wish you would read it.  I want to go down the Oho River on a steam boat for the scenery is very beautiful.  We can visit Niagara Falls this Autumn for it is not a long trip from here.

I have an abundance of them laid up for you.  Abby dear our marriage is to result in our mutual improvement is it not?

For the past year or two I have made no progress I have rather retrograded.  I am exceedingly anxious that the day of our marriage shall be the commencement of a new era in my mental & spiritual life & also in my social life.

I am glad you have made up your mind to like out here & not to find fault with everything.  Most eastern folks for the first few months of their stay here find a great deal of fault with every thing & are constant;y saying \"They don't do so East\" rendering those around them unhappy & themselves both miserable & ridiculous.

I want good to result to both of us from our marriage.  I do not expect to pass through out married life without care & trials, life is full of perplexities.

Sept 25 1847.\nMuch Esteemed Cousin\n\n   I recieved your letter with pleasure last week and should have answered it e'er this had not my leisure from study been wholly occupied in ministering to a sick schoolmate.\n   Two of the young ladies here have been quite sick with the typhus fever. One of them (Harriet Goodspeed) I have had the care of which has put me in this rear with so- good to my studies.\n  I think I am very pleasantly situated here, more so than I anticipated when I first came, the many little rules they require to be observed do not trouble me, I have come to the conclusion that they are all needed among so large a company of girls.  I like the principal, Miss Dodge. think she is well fitted for such a place.  My studies are Algebra, Phisiology, Rhetoric and Chemistry & I might add compositions.  O Dear I wish I like to write them better, but it is such a task that I am almost unhappy during the day devoted to them.","8eac6d143a2d0ba54b3d4a3884a055d6.jpg"],[40280,"If you know of any course of mental discipline by which that exercise might be rendered more agreeable I should be most happy to have you inform me of it.\n\n   I have enjoyed much thus far, and anticipate much yet to come during my walking excursions.  There are beautiful places here to walk I think, and I like the place better the more I see of it.  What a vast difference there is in persons with regard to the objects which interest them in their walk.  I have thought of this a good deal when observing the motives which seem to lead the you ladies here to indulge in that exercise.  Is it not strange that people are not prompted more from a love for the beauties of Nature to wander forth at morn, at noon, and in the still evening to gaze and admire the works of our Creator, and in thus doing be led to adore and love HIm.  It seems to me there is a still small voice in every murmuring rill, every leaf of the forest and blade of grass which seems to say, \"Remember Him who gave us!  Is it not ungrateful in us to be so unmindful of that Being from whom cometh all our blessings!\n  I have a fine prospect of the western sky from my chamber window where I often sit at \"days decline\" watching the lingering smiles of the monarch of the day and he departs to other climes, to cheer and gladden by his presence other beings.  Then it is I think of absent friends and scenes which, the past are still fresh in memory.  You\n\nasked if I remember the beautiful sunset when at Uncle's and the","fe1d15999c43b2ebad28b84556cb99be.jpg"],[40281,"pleasure it gave us in viewing it.  I do, and often think how much I enjoyed the ride home that evening that beautiful evening.  We have had some fine evenings the past week here we not? The young ladies of the school gave a serenade one of those evenings after nine o'clock to several families here in the village.  We had a fine time. \n\n   I have hesitated some in deciding to take that school but have made up my mind that if the school will consist of twenty scholars I will take it.  You wrote me it was small but did not state the probable number.  It seems as if it would not be very interesting with less than twenty scholars for a winter school.\n   I think I can make it more profitable to teach for 2'50 than to remain at home to braid palm leaf hats.  I have often heard it said \"a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\" and perhaps I might not find one any better if I attempt.  I am very much obliged to you for your efforts in obtaining the school.\n   Please tell Lydia to accept much love form me instead of a letter now and wish she would write me all about herself and school, how she likes her teacher etc I will try and answer it.  I was just going to make an apology for the bad writing but I remember our teacher says it is not proper, for we should always write well if at all, so I will be silent about it.\n\nYour affectionate cousin\nSarah C.","89aa7117ff3071130e34267ce6691fd0.jpg"],[40282,"Mr. Nathan Kendall\nPetersham, Mass.\nStamped- Townsend, MA\n\n                 Sept 28","37f2527bfb61083785bbd404f63b7c73.jpg"],[40283,"Phillipston Tues Eve Feb 26 1850\nCousin Nathan\n\n   In looking at the date of your letter I am freshly reminded of the rapid flight of time.  Almost eight weeks since it was written surely time tarries not for any one.\n  Yet we measure not our life by the flight of time, do we?  Not alone by this I mean.  How much may a few days add to the chain of events in our life at some times seemingly more than years in the regular course of life.  \"We measure our life by the changes wrought in the Soul\" this remark is from a much valued friend is it not true?  \n   Since I last saw you I have spend eleven weeks at school and there amid new scenes, new joys, new friends it seemed as if time had borne me much farther than the reality.\n   I have again closed another term of eleven weeks in teaching.

Dear Cousins I wish you could listen to our good sermons they are solemn & impressive.\n\n  You say Cousin Nathan you do not yet feel satisfied with regard to Christ's object in coming into the world the atonement wh. he made etc.  I don't know as I can say any thing wh. will satisfy you mind.  I think it is in Christ's death that we have hope, What is, that in dying he made an atonement for sin.  It is true he fulfilled the law in his life but man was exposed to the penalty of that law which was death and he must then suffered it of a Savior had not been provided; but Jesus suffering in his stead satisfied that law and has provided a way wherein all who will believe in him shall be saved of sin and death.  Has He not shown love passing all human comprehension.  Will not those be worthy of eternal punishment who refuse to believe in & obey such a Savior!  I have thought more of this subject this winter than previously it has been the topic of my Sabbath School lessons.  It seems more & more interesting & grand to me.\n  I would say more but my sheet is filled.  May you obtain clear & satisfactory ideas upon this.

I wrote him last Tuesday & expected that he would have answered my letter before this, shall expect one tomorrow eve.  I wrote him that I would come & work for him six months for one dollar per day do not know whether he will be willing to pay that or not.  If he does not feel willing to pay that I think I better go below or to middleown as you spoke.  Brother Pathon you do not know how I dislike to go off & leave our native place, but it cannot be otherwise.  Our school has been four weeks from next wednesday to keep.  I may come home four weeks from last saturday but would rather stop at the examination if it is so that I can.  You spoke about having an auction the first of april and had sold of the old things that belonged to mother, and about te","2794bd9f4ed9a7b36b03882e68833c0e.jpg"],[40341,"grave stones & fence around the yard.  I am willing to do my part towards them & wish you would see about them as you said.  You must get such ones as you & the rest think best as I do not know what kind of ones those of Williams Millers are.  I do not know why Lydia & Sarah do not write to me for I wrote to them three weeks ago but have received no answer, & Edwin has not wrote me since I left home, I wish they would all write to me as it would do me so much good. About my teaching you must do as you think best if you have a chance to get me a school, I shall leave it intirely with you.  We have got into the 21st sec. in Algebra & shall get to the ninth book in Geometry tomorrow we have reviewed the seventh also.  I like the school very much.  There seems to be nothing new here worth relating.  I wish you would write to me soon, and let me know when you go to Boston and the rest of the news.\nFrom our brother\nD.W.

I never was so busy in my life as I have been for this fall, & shall be for some time to come  I was glad to hear that Myron was getting along so well but I fear for Jesse I rec'd a letter from him this morn & will send it to you so that you can see just what he wrote & judge for yourself.  Write him soon will you not & advise him what to do.  I think he has not energ & perseverence of character enough or else he would have obtained a school","839890e273c1767c07d00dc5f0281dca.jpg"],[40371,"for the winter but you must advise him as you think best I shall write him in a few days.  In regard to that mate of Edwin's.  I was at Galesburg this week & should have gone & seen Edwin but had to go to Lason Ill on business for the Co so that I had time to stop at Galesburg only over night on my way back.  I staid there Tuesday eve Raymond told me that he would go & see Edwin for me & said he knew that Edwin would pay that mate.  Had it been possible I should have gone & seen him myself & shall now if he does not see to it before long, you need give yourself no uneasiness about itas I will see that he will pay it by the 1st of January.\n\n  Raymond is making preparations for Farming in the Spring.  He has now seven of the best horses I have seen for a long time.  Three pair that are perfectly matched & one single","3443b26951ecafaee91c52f0958152fa.jpg"],[40372,"Horse to drive himself.  Little Sarah was sick with the Lung Fever but was quite bright this morning I left.  Minnie runs all about the house & knows me well.  In regard to that Land I will go to Partnership with you on it & want you should write me upon the recpt of this the time the payments become due & the amt you wish me to pay etc so that I may be prepared to meet as I like to have all things ready at their time.  I shall  continue some way to get the $100.  Edwin owes me to pay in to the Land I think I had rather have it in Land than where it is.  I wrote to Bennet from La Salle Ill this week in regard to a situation as Rodman an this Road.  I tried hard to get a situation as Asst Engineer for him but Mr. Hurd was afraid that his experience would not warrant him the situation until he had proved him.  He says","a403eac2c09cb3ea5b1ac996aedd5a45.jpg"],[40373,"that he wants young men for his Rodman that are determined to go into the Proffession & continue in it & then as fast as they get fitted for the station of Asst & the chance opens he can have some one to fill it that he knows, & can depend upon.  When I wrote Bennet I expected a young man from Lacon to Rod for me but he for some reason has I think concluded not to come.  I think now that Bennet might stay on the Division with me as I have only a temporary one.  My Old Rodman being oblidged to return to N.Y. on account of some trouble at home leaving me minus a Rodman. I have a fine Division & one that will give one a great deal of experience & I think if he wishes to get into the business again this is his best chance but he must do as he thinks best.  I should enjoy having him with me much.  His pay would be 33$ per month & his board & washing would cost him 12$ per month","c3c481e8c39223384356808f65274541.jpg"],[40374,"that is all the expenses I have to pay the Co. pay my living bills etc should he go on the Division West of me his pay would be 35$ per month & all his expenses paid till the Division is located & that will take till nearly spring if not quite & then it would be 35$ & he pay his own board.  These are the facts of the case just as they are & he can do as he thinks best.  I should enjoy much having him here & think this is his best chance to get into Engineering again but want him to act just as his own mind dictates.  I wanted much to get him a situation as Asst as he & myself had ploded along so on that Road together but could not until he has had a thourough trial.  Mr. Hurd Discharged one Resident & one Asst Engineer & since then has been very carefull who he employed.\n\n If he should come, we could get along.

Please send word to your aunt that she can come up with you if she chooses, or, she may come when we send you down which will be in a fortnight.  She can do either, as she prefers.  We send $2 to pay for your stage up. We will pay your school bill on your return - Sarah is unclear some - got rested pretty well after her visit to Glyn?.  All the rest of us are well.  From your afft father R Everett.","f68577a9c3e9b1d22ff1dc646695c73d.jpg"],[34364,"Remsen, Feby 11, 1858.\nDear Anna - Having a little time this morning I thought I would devote it to write a few lines to you - I am afraid it will be a disappointment to you, very much so, not to have your sister to come to Galesburgh - but we thought it was not doing justice with Jane to have her bear the expenses of both her sisters - especially since Elizabeth makes the offer to bear Cynthia's expences there as she has done.  We hope you are getting over your hiraeth by this time pretty well - as you are so fully employed - and are by this time becoming more and more acquainted with kind Christian friends in your new home.  We were much gratified to read in Jane's letter how well you succeeded in the Examination, and in reading your Paper - hope you will be careful, as mother says, not to over do - and injure your health in that way.  Health is precious and should be cared for very much for if it fails - all is gone with regard to","93b0c57e092dd713ac4a0b29fd5d43f0.jpg"],[34365,"comfort and usefulness.  Let us know in next letter whether your health holds on pretty well - or does the teeth-ache etc continue to trouble you.  The revival in Remsen and Steuben has given us much spiritual enjoyment.  We have tried to pray more in secret than before - and here we have found the promise, \"I will meet with thee there\" sweetly realised and fulfilled.  O it is sweet and profitable to meet the Savior in secret prayer.  We have found that promise also sweet and precious, \"When two or three are met together in my name there am I in the midst of them,\"  The presence of the Savior - his gracious presence, by his Spirit - in affording and in preaching and praying, and in the conviction and conversion of sinners - is precious indeed. The meeting houses were full every week evening as well as on the Sabbath and the majority by far were church members or new converts - I mean that it was so while we held the meetings in the Remsen meeting houses and in Capel Ucha:  We have communed this week at unclear, and French Road and Perygraig?.","0b091c74d000ad8c363b7b158d8fa29a.jpg"],[34366,"In those places, so far, the majority of the congregation are those who do not profess religion - Last Sabbath evening we had the meeting held in Penynwydd? Church - and when separated by calling the Society to \"aros yu ol\" no new ones remained - and the greater part by far of the congregation left - We had a meeting there Monday night also - and no new ones remained. Penywyrdd? is a hardened place - young people are very much hardened.  But if we shall have the power of the Holy Spirit given in answer to the prayer of faith - stout hearts and stubborn wills must yield.  Nothing can bring this about but the infinite power of God's love and grace.  Next Sabbath is our communion Sabbath at Capel Ucha - some will probably be received of the new convers - from 20 to 30 have come to the Society - But I do not expect nearly all to be received next time.  We will unto again next week.  We all join in love to you both - From your afft father Robert Everett","8459d949f894634b953b3bdf418ed81c.jpg"],[34367,"Your \"pa\" and \"ma\" are much inclined to have Sis stay till the commencement of another term, as the winter term as already commenced in N.H. - and have her go to school near home for a few weeks - But I do not know whether it will be so or not - It is a time of a good deal of anxiety in our minds on this unclear - We feel it very hard to part with her.  May the Lord direct us, and make us willing to do what would be best.","0719c0f524ca9805e7e443c81cf41f4c.jpg"],[34368,"Rev. R. Everett D.

Were glad you had received the $15 safe - we ought to have sent more and will do so, if you feel that you need any - please say so, if you do.  Your mother and myself have got over the cough we were troubled with, pretty much now - I am quite well of it and your ma almost so. Ellen Roberts is with us now, and we feel happy to have her.  We have also hired a young mate (late from the old country) for the year, to work out with Eddy on the farm - and do the rolling etc. instead of G. Jones - We are to pay $9 per month for the Summer months, and $7 for the winter months.  Lewis & Jane and the two little ones have been up to Granpa Wms - returned this morning - all well.  In haste - from your afftc Father Robert Everett","6f5f56426e265e07ace8648a6c90408e.jpg"],[34370,"Remsen, Sep 18, 1858\nMy Dear Daughter Cynthia - I am sorry to find by your last letter (received the 16th) that you had been looking for a letter from us for sometime and had not had one. I suppose we are trusting one to the other to write, and thus the time slides away while we are busy with other things - We hope you will write often - though your Note may be a short one never mind about that - we love much to hear often from you and from all of you.  We had a Camp Meeting last week near the place where it was held last year - had very good weather - no rain - good preaching - suppused to be from 5000 to 6000 people - this week was our Cymanfu at Utica Deerfield and Floyd - good meetings, so far - next week will be at Trenton, Steuben & Penywyrydd?\nWith regard to John, I had made several enquiries to try to find $100 to lend him - but I find by yesterday's Tribune","ae8a1ea90546620e4cb197c8aa880015.jpg"],[34371,"that the Land Sales in Kansas and Nebraska have been postponed till July - so he will not need the money at the present time - We are expecting daily to hear again from John - Your cousins Thos D and Mary went on a visit to Columbus, Ohio about a fortnight ago to some of Thomas's relatives - and we heard this week in Utica, that Thomas had gone on a trip to Kansas, and left Mary in Columbus till he returns - He will of course go to Osawatone? - they will be pleasantly surprised to see him.  Must close with our united love to you all - Your father Robt Everett","43f71d7521f8bf52beb61ea490f71408.jpg"],[34372,"Remsen Nov 9 1858\nMy dear daughter Cynthia - We received your letter of Nov. 4th to Anna yesterday - also one from Jennie and Sarah by the same mail - were glad to hear from you all three by the same mail.  Sarah is much better since she has been at Saratoga - Dr thinks she may come home next Saturday - when we hope to see her again.  Jennie talks quite discouragingly of her hearing this time - She seems to gain fast the first week or two, and afterwards does not seem to improve - she will however staay some time loner to see what the effect will be.  Having no money but some on the Wisten? we sent to our friend Ebenezer Lewis in New Yorks what we have of Discount money to be exchanged - and he will put $15 in this and forward it to you.\nYour mother is knee is getting better fast - It is so much better that she has not much of any laments now.  It was the knee pan that went out of place - Your Mother was going down cellar and her foot slipt, and to save herself from falling, which she did, her foot turned in some way so as to through the knee pan out of place.  We had Dr. Price to pin it - and hope it will soon be quite well again.","7f2d154099ff9462c442987816d319dc.jpg"],[34373,"Your mother went with us to Penywydd? last Sabbath and took some cold I suppose, so that her face is swollen with Erisipelas - May is trying to doctor her - but I fear it will not get well as soon as they seem to think it will - Mother is about and feels pretty well - I hope this will not be very bad.\nAbout your cloak, Mother thinks if you can make (get it made I mean) the talma over to suit you, perhaps you had better do so, as you have worn it sometime as it is, and it would in that way be something new.  You will then have to get something page damaged to wear in the spring.  If you think you can not fix it as you wish, you can get you a new cloak.  Use your own judgment combined with Elizabeth's.  I hope you will be able to have your bonnet made over to suit you.  I think it will be very pretty with a plume and a flower.  You will need to get you some warm gloves for church my dear.  Those you have will perhaps do for school for a while.  Had you not better get an opera or some other kind of hood to wear to school? You will certainly need onel.  Accept a great bunch of love for yourself and all the rest.  I am glad you are able to hold your head so high.  Go ahead, dearest, and remember we all love you.  \nMother says be sure and clothe yourself warm.  You need some rubbers don't you?","ff4c402ef61227419dc43644dbff8c22.jpg"],[34374,"Dear Eddy,\nOur ink is all spilt so I write with a pencil.  I am very glad indeed to get so many letters from you.  Do they have to tell you how to spell every word? Or do you remember some of them.  I wonder if you can spell Eddy.  I wish I could send you some apples.  We have a kind that will keep clear into the summer if we had enough of them.  Frank yoked up a pair of yearling calves this morning and tried to drive them, but they were pretty awkward.  We have got some little pigs.  The sow had ten.  The weather has been so cold.","1b270c2f99e237e67652fcc07942281f.jpg"],[34375,"She lost three, and will lose 1 more.

We have 3 strangers tonight - Mr George - Mr Goodhue - and the Dentist - Mary is busy making beds for them.  We often feel as if we wanted mother back again - and feel thankful that there is that hope before long. - We had a meeting of the friends of the Tract cause today at Capel Cerig Remsen - and succeeded in forming a Tract Society for Remsen, Steuben and vicinity - the different denominations will unite in making the collections by going two and two from house to house, the same as in the bibl cause.  The officers are R. E. President, M. Roberts Vice President, A. E. Jones Treasurer, J. S. Williams, Secretary - The next annual meeting to be the 2nd Wed of May 1849 at the Baptist Meeting House in Remsen - Collections to be made next August - We hope now that something effectual will be done for this good cause.  I have been to see Mrs (J. W.) Roberts today - she is better than I feared she was - looks about as you saw her, - They live in their new house.  Our shed frame is to be raised this week on Thursday, I think.  Benjamin Thomas and wife joined our church last Saturday.  Also Catherine Prichard by letter.  The subscriptions for Library have been paid up nearly all.  After communion last Sabbath, the friends came forward to the table and paid up.  I hope to see you next week unless you conclude to come home with John this week.  Must conclude with love to you both.  From your affectionate \"Pa\" R.

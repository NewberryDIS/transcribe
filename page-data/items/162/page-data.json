Robbie was taken with diarrhea last night.  I was awakened about two o'clock by his calling for water.  On striking a light, I found that hee had been sick some little time and besides diarrhea he had vomited a good deal -- apparently without much pain at the time as it must have happened half an hour before he called.  After he called his","5345d21f65044adfba4a91122d5ad5d9.jpg"],[37449,"bowels moved three times within an hour, and he had a high fever and drank a good deal of cold water.  I gave him Rhus at first, afterwards Bry.  He did not seem to be in much pain at any time but quite feaverish and his body and breath smelled so sour.  He slept pretty well after three until after I got up and after breakfast his mother gave him a warm bath and bathed his head with cooler water afterwards for half an hour with great apparent relief to him.  He wanted nothing to eat through the day but drank a good deal of water and slept more than usual.  By team time he was feeling much","5ad96ce50d18ab220fb32ca8e042aa3f.jpg"],[37450,"better and ate a couple of milk crackers and a little cracker browes.  I think to worst is over.  Baby is quite well.

I feel like making another desperate effort to find one that will buy.  We were pleased to hear that J.E. and J.C. were among the fortunate ones who shook hands with the next Vice President.  It is quite an honor.  I will finish this in the morning.\nSat Morn -- Robbie slept well all night but his diarrhea is quite bad yet.  He has had a bath this morning and appears quite like himself.  Does not","1ed9ee16b9e922da23e0f653609f2725.jpg"],[37451,"have much feaver this morning.

We must try to keep all such things from him as much as possible.\nHow did Anna get along during your absence, and how is she now?  I think she had better come back with Carroll and one of her sisters might come with her for company.  Black berries are plenty here now but they ask 8 & 10 cts for then her.  We have not bought any yet.  Does Carroll intend to come home on Monday.  Hope he is not making you much extra work.  We hope to hear from him this cut.

We were mercifully spared from suffering during the severe cold of Jan. 7, 8, and 9th.  The papers tell of 28 persons frozen to death in the western part of this state.  A good many about here were frost bitten -- ears, nose cheeks hands or feet.  A good many hogs and some cattle men frozen to death.  One man about seven miles south lost 7 or 8 cows.  The greater number of cattle about here have no shelter except wind-breaks and some have sheds where they can get shelter.  And with 3 to 5 days of strong north wind with the mercury merging from 0 to 18 or 20 below zero it was a terrible strain on man and beast.  The storm was so general throughout the country that we are anxious to hear how you got through with it.","d31504e9e1725ce882bf4cef49cf228a.jpg"],[37482,"The idea that they never have cold wintry weather in Kansas is exploded.

Baby's food seems to pass undigested.  He and Robbie enjoy having all the milk they want one eveing not long since he went to sleep with his mug of milk in his hand and before he got though drinking the milk He sometimes falls asleep in Robbie's little cane seat rocking chair that we brought out with us.  Hee is learning to talk and we think he is a remarkably bright eyed little fellow.  His eyes are getting darker.  I think he is getting to look more like his aunt Jennie.  His mother cut his hair last week.  She is just now undressing him for the night and he is too full of mischief for anything Robbie has his night-dress on and is lying on the couch trying to go to sleep.

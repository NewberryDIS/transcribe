Paddock and his lady took tea with us on the day of Tem. Convention.  They have visited their daughters Mrs. Bradford this winter.  Her husband is still Pastor of the church at Gilbertville.   Charles Talbott (Doct. Talbott) is now one of the regular physicians in this place.   He has bought out Doct. Thomas.  You recollect he had a fine situation.  I called on Mrs. Talbott a short time since.  She has a very pleasant house every thing in first rat order.  I desire to visit there as soon as I can take the baby out.  Mrs. Heffron called here last week, and Mr. and Mrs. Chapman, Mrs. H's health is very much improved.  Mr. Heffron is still traveling.  He has completed his sower bath business, and is now selling patent for a shingle machine.    \n\n    You seemed to be low spirited in your last letter.

I need not tell you, my dear sister, how happy it would make us all to hear such precious intelligence from you.  This is our daily petition.  It is the greatest blessing we can ask for on about about sister.  Has there been a revival in the school?  If so how many conversies, and did it still continue?\nThurs. P.M.  We have some anxiety about the sickness you mention.  Has the young lady whose case you mentioned as doubtful recovered?  and are there any others dangerously ill?  We hope you will be doubly careful of your own health.  If you have a severe cold you had better break it up at once by a sweat.  Mr. Butler, Mother, Mary and I have all had severe colds this winter and have cured them by sweating.  I have taken a sweat two or three times during the winter.  Having the care of the babe at night I have been unvariably exposed to colds.  I am now more used to it, and he is generally very good nights.  Last night he slept all night like a little kitten excepting when he awaked to morn.  for you must know he take his meals by night as well as by day. We have been more careful of colds this season on account of the prevailing sickness.  the fear has generally commenced by the appearance of a severe cold, headache, pain in the limbs, etc.  It has not prevailed in the village.  Has been confined to the school mostly.  We are all now in usual health and shall be anxious to hear that you also are quite well of your cold.  Sabbath before last Robert had quite a hard cold and Mary gave him the wet sheet for this he paid her a dollar putting good fee, we thought.  Last Sabbath he was quite well.  He seems to be in goo health and spirits.  Hope he will continue to prosper in his business.  It would he so pleasant to have him settle in Utica.  Last night the snow fell several inches.  today it is disappearing as fast as it came.  Things begin to have the appearance of approaching Spring.  I shall be glad to see the green grass and hear the sweet birds again.  How I wish I could visit you this Spring.  but I cannot leave my family now you know.  and I do not wish to if the babe was old enough to take with me I should like it.  I enjoy myself well with him.  better than I used to without him.  Is that strange?  It is now four o'clock, I suppose you are studying Physiology.  My paper says, stop.

I need not tell you, dear sister, how happy it makes us to learn by your letters of your prosperity, good health and so forth.  That you may be prospered and blessed in your studies and that your health may be continued so that in a few months you may again meet with us around the dear, happy fireside at home, is your sister's fervent wish and prayer.  O! Jane, I never realized what a blessing it is to enjoy health, and reason, so much as I have this winter, when we have beheld, with sad yet chastened hearts, the ranges of disease and death among our loved companions.  How grateful we should be when we think that our family has never been called to mourn the loss of one of its member.  The circle yet remain unbroken.  But it will not always be so.  Who will go first?  A veil is drawn over the future  and we cannot tell.\n   Our school has again commenced; over fifty students more than thirty gentlemen and about twenty ladies.  Everything goes on very pleasantly, although our number is small.  Several who were sick in the winter have returned this term.  Miss Wood is our teacher.  She has entirely  recovered, says her health is better than before.  Miss Backas has also recovered I think.  Martha Chany and Julia","751f56d1d699bfff6aa3e33cfacd75d5.jpg"],[36607,"attend school this term.  They say they are going to answer your letter as soon as they possibly can.  Mr. Mark's family are all well now [axating] excepting Mrs. S.  She gains very slowly indeed; is able to ride out a little.  Louisa has the drawing class.  She is going to teach this summer, and when she leaves,, Hannah will take her place.  I take drawing.  I devote two hours a day to it and now taking lesson in foliage.  I commenced Virgil this term.  Mr. Grant, M.M. Gardner and myself compose the class.  Mr. Farnham is the teacher of course I assure you I feel lonely enough when I am in there all alone, that is with no other ladies.  I am also reviewing Natural Philosophy.  I write in Latin at ten, Philosophy at one, and draw from three to five.  the school appears much as it used to, though the classes are smaller and we often think as we meet for prayers and pass through the halls and recitation rooms, of those who we want to meet with us there, but whose faces we shall never see, there again.  Mrs. Tallman and family are well.  Susanna Walton went home last week.\nWednesday morning\n\n     I commenced this last Saturday bu have not had time to finish it until now.  Have but a few moments to write as it is most time to go to school.

It gladden our heart to hear of your prosperity and happiness how much more would it to hear that you had become a christian.  Dear Jane, about let your press of engagements dwarf your mind from the great question of Eternity.  You have spoken of the earnestness and faithfulness of your pastor.  Do not let his instructions fall upon your ear unheeded.  O, say sister have much good you could do were you a true christian, and how much will you leave undone if you continue in inpenitence.  My constant pray for you is that you may become a faithful deciple of the Savior.\n\nThank you for your schedule that we may know how you are engaged any hour of the day, though I suppose that lasts no longer than today.

John has moved far away, and death has invaded his little circle.  How much I would give to hear that his health was restored and that they are happy in their new home.

Do nothing to draw attention to it, and if you succeed in attaching your pupils to you and in gaining the confidence and esteem of those about you it may not hurt you so much as would at first seem.

We shall expect some of you here this Fall.  Hope you will arrange so to make us a good long visit.  It is a good time of the year for excursions.  We shall all enjoy it very much.

I have not had time to write many letters of late, though you ought not to have been one of the neglected ones.  Hattie and her father have both had an attack of lung fever.  Hattie first and Mr. B. after.  Hattie was not as sick as a year ago and recovered much sooner.  She seems quite well again now.  About four weeks ago Mr. B. was taken with fever and a bad cough.  He is nearly well now excepting he is quite thin and weak, and gains slowly.  He takes some bitters, but is relying mostly on nourishing food,","168c0de858e8aafeb1c7817618a621f3.jpg"],[36747,"beef steak, broth, eggs, cream, etc.  As the weather gets warmer and he can go out more, I trust he will gain faster.

Isn't it queer?  Do you think I need feel concerned about it?  My general health is good. my appetite good, and I sleep well and do my work as usual.  still it seems so strange.  I wish I knew whether I need feel troubled about it.  Perhaps I got too tired moving, and I think the walk up Trinity spire hurt me.  I consulted a Physician.  He gave me some pills containing he said {nuxeromica} bark and some other things, but I hate to take them. and have been hoping to get better without.  He thought it might be the effect of change of climate perhaps or a touch of the malaria of the air.  The ague, you know, prevails here somewhat.

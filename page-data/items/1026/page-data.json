Instant at a Place called the painted Post in Newyork Government up the Susquehannah; stop'd at Germantown, and staid Meeting, din'd with Tho? Forrist, who joined us as a companion to go the journey, call'd at Ellis Cleavers & refreshed ourselves and Horses, and got in the Evening to about 23 Miles on our way & lodged.\n13  2  Rose early & reached Bethlehem to dine, took a little time and went to see the young Women & girls apartment accompanied by a friendly man that my companion was acquainted with, these young People appear to be kept in a good Degree of Innocency & decorum; employ'd in curious Needlework, &.c\namong these youth there are some from New-york, Jersey, Maryland and other distant Place; among them were two friends Children, which I was sorry to see in the Practic of compliments and fashions quite contrary to our Principles, when Friends once give way in these Things, & strike hands\nwith such People, the youth are in great danger of loosing that innocent Simplicity becoming our holy Profession; we left Bethlehem about 4 O Clock, and rode to Nazaroth about 10 Miles & bated, from thence to Hillars Tavern near the wied? gap about 7 Miles.\n14  3  Considering the Distance to Wyoming. the difficulty of the roads without necelsary Accommodation, we concluded to go but about 16 Miles to Jacob Meriwine's.\n15  4  Palsed through the Bare Swamp & Shades of Death, with much difficulty & reached Wyoming a little after Sun set about 35 miles, this was a hard day's journey over hills, Stones & mud Holes without proper stages of Enter","deabc57db8312fb3aea89c5cd813c081.jpg"],[68351,"1791  W D\n6 mo: 15  4 Entertainment; on our way, we had several beautiful Prospects of the great Mountains, which I think little inferior to crossing the Aligana, these prospects are to me very Awfull, as is the Atlantic Ocean, well might the Psalmist say 'great & marvellous are thy Works'.\n16  5  Left Wyoming, crossed the River & rode 8 or 10 Miles pretty & good roads, & crossed the Susquehanna again, and travelled along Shore with much difficulty, often obliged to lead our Horses, din'd at Jones's about 17 Miles, & then rode to Ousters and lodged. (which was very indifferent. 24 M.)\n17  6  Rose early and rode about 4 miles to Breakfast, and in the evening a little after dark reached Wyohising, where there was formerly a large Indian Town, and put up at a Son of William Hancocks of  Philadelphia. (30 Miles)\n18  7  Rode about 26 Miles to Shickshickney to Coli Spoldens and lodged; he lives where the Indians formerly had a settlement, a beautifull situation in the side of the River.\n19  1  Rain this Morning, we staid till between 12 & 1 o'clock, and then set off for Tioga Point about 3 Miles and got Dinner; this Place appears to have been another Indian settlement, now forming into a Town a few log Houses & about 6 or 8 Families & a store where we lodged, & pretty comfortably entertained.\n20  2  Our companion T. Forrist inclining to stay, not being very well, my beloved young companion. J.S. and I put forward to Newtown Pint where we were informed the Treaty was likely to be held, the Waters being so low in the Tioga that the Boats were not likely to get up with the Stores any farther, and Runners were sent out to inform the Indians of this Event, we reached Newtown about 5 O Clock where we found Col","1bc9afb3e32efe1b7a16d523c4c963b8.jpg"],[68352,"as am Ambassador to go into the western Country endeavour to bring about a reconciliation and put a stop to the effusion of Blood, and said he agreed that the white people might exterminate the Indians; but they could not do it at once or in a day, it would take time, that the Indian Hatchet cost them something, and the white People's Hatchet would cost them a great deal; meaning the Expence of War, he further said the western Indians might be driven over the line or as I understood him beyond the Lakes, and said a Wolf might be driven from her Place of abode, but she could return and do Mischief, he seem'd very earnest that a conciliation might take place & pointed out as he apprehended why it was otherwise, he said the bad white People had made incroachment, & from the Injury they had received from the Whites there, Minds were much prejudiced, he also said there were bad People on both sides and it required Wisdom to make proper Distinctions. Col. Pickering in reply agreed that it would be consistant with his Judgment, that offers of Peace should be made before they struck or carried on the war.\nAfter the Conference we deliver'd a letter of Recommendation to the Col,; who politely offer'd to do us any Service in his Power, and conducted us to a certain Doctor Pakr, a place of perhaps the best Accommodation in the Town. The Town contains 10 or 12 log Houses & Huts scattered in the space of half or three quarters of a Mile, in an old Indian Cornfield, a flat Piece of Ground on the River, but among Trees chiefly Pines.\nWe went to see our Horses which we had sent over the River to Pasture, my Horse's back being hurt by our rough and long Travel through the roughest Country & difficultest Roads I ever past, we frequently had to ride along shore to miss the Mountain, where there was scarce room for our Horse's feet, and in other Places more roomy the Horses lay as if shot out of","68329255bb8ae72abb168717d8ed52eb.jpg"],[68353,"of a Cart, which obliged us frequently to walk, it was with difficulty in manty Places that we or our Horses could keep our feet; nevertheless we persevered in pretty good spirits Col. Forrist was an old Soldier, and travelled the road before, but what I most admired was to see my young friend and Companion encounter the greatest Difficulty with so much cheerfulness; our living both as to food & lodging being similar to the Description of the Country; at times I was not altogether free from fears & doubting, it seemed like a confirmation to me to have such an agreeable Companion. In the afternoon we went to Col. Pickering's Quarters where he introduced to me a young man by the Name of Parrish, who had just returned from the Indian Nations, having been employ'd as a Messenger to give information of the Treaty, & invite the Indians in, this young man appeared to have something clearer about him, and I was the more taken with him for his Namesake, which I have rarely met with, he went with me to the Indians Cabbins and interpretted for me where I had an opportunity of informing them who we were, and where we came from, & our Business which, was purely to attend the Treaty, & pay them assist in love & good will, and take them by the hand as friends & decendents of the first Propriator of Pennsylvania, W. Penn, who was careful to purchase the Indian's Lands, and was particularly attentive to do them justice, and to promote Peace & Harmony in the Land, this pleased them, & they expressed a proper sense of our Friendship in coming so far to see them; in the course of our Visits I endeavoured to guard them against Strong Drink, and pointed out the pernicious Effects of using it. \nWe went to see our Horses; spent some time in writing and in Visiting the Indians, we are informed the","e691666f3533bc79a6302b1b920ac128.jpg"],[68354,"the main body may be expected on 7th day, time seemed a little heavy on our hands.\nWe went to wash, it being difficult to keep clean in these back countries, in the Afternoon there came in about 30 Onedas, with a white flag flying, & without Arms, to denote themselves to be Men of Peace; soon after we went to their Tents & took them by the hand, and altho they spoke no English, they appeared glad to see us; these People afford Instruction, they make a little serve & in a ten hours build themselves Houses or Cabbins with Bark, which they peel off the Trees that seem to be tolerably comfortable, when finished they spread their Matchboats & then begin to cook, we called to see Capt. Hendrick the stockbridge Chief who entertained us in giving an Account of a Tribe of western Indians by the Name of Chippeways; He said they were earnestly solicited by sir Wm. Johnson to fight & join the 6 Nations and promised to give themselves armaments &; but their Chief absolutely refused saying, you lead your Indians into War & call them your Friends, & pretend Friendship to them, but giving them Presents, by this means many are slain in Battle, and frequently their Bodies are exposed on the face of the Earth without Burial; I keep my People in my Arms as in an Inclosure, & do not suffer them to fight except on some very extraordinary Occasion to defend ourselves when attacked, and we are careful to bury our Dead, that when we see the Graves we may remember our Friends; He seemed to point out the Chippeways as principled against War. And likewise related a Tradition handed down by the Antients; that there was a time when the Indians lived together in Harmony in one Town or a Place, but they offended the good Spirit, who sent a famine among them, which obliged them to disperse and become a separate People, by which means their Language was confounded; so that the different Tribes could not understand each other.","6f26b5d96a961ddec51188d79f988c2d.jpg"],[68355,"But it appears that one Brant who found a hunting Party of about 30 of the aforesaid peacable Indians out after Game, who told them their Tribe had joined the 6 Nations in War, which induced them to take up the Hatchet thro' Deception, when their Chief was informed thereof, he disowned them as his People, as disregarding his Discipline, and kept them at a Distance a considerable Time, such was the Care of the Chippeway to support ___ (?) & good Order---In the Evening we went home with Daniel Ross about 7 Miles North, he is a friendly Man & professes to be convinced of friends Principles, & I hope in a good measure is; he is called or known among the People by the Name of friend Ross, he treated us with kindness and told us he had taken up about 60 thousand Acres of Land and is settling families on it as fast as he can; but expresses a belief that their is something like a Scourge hanging over the Land, & a fear possesses his Mind that unless the great Preserver of Men preventl what is call'd the Heathon will again bring Terror upon the inhabitants.\nOur Horses were missing, our friend Ross furnished us with others, & told us if we did not find our own we should be welcome to them, but ours were found next day.\nWe walked about 5 Miles & din'd at Saml Seleys (?), we went thro a fine fertile part; the timber large in the low lands mostly white pine & very tall, the clear land produces wheat from 20 to 30 bushels per Acre. When we return'd we found Col. Forrist at our Lodging, he having stop'd at Tioga Point, we were glad to see him; but found him uneasy to return home.\nAfter taking Care of our horses we endeavoured to retire at our Lodgeing; but were much disturbed by rude Children, any Mind was exercised on Account of the Indians being supplied with Whisky, whereby the indiscreet became intoxicated; we took an Opportunity to lay the Matter before Col, Pickering requesting his serious Attention, that if possible a stop might be put to so pernicious a Practice that tended to render Treaties abortive or to little effect, he heard with Attention and seemed","2eae65d6c75d1dc0a5ff97434694cf66.jpg"],[90635,"Bureau of Indian Affairs\nJournals to","cb0e21b82a033e707ad840c38471d339.jpg"]],"transcount":7,"percentTranscribed":5,"date":[1791,1794],"category":"Edward E.

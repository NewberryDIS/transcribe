I had need of this assurance for I had learned that the English had tried me and had already burnt me in effigy.  \nThe said chief demanded of the warriors, who had me in charge, that they should not allow me to be stripped, but that they should take me with all my clothes to their village.

There were three French captives with me, two of whom Mr. de Valrenne had sent with Ounonare(g)on (SP) to Montreal to carry the first news of the descent of the Iroquois, and who had","8bf079328f4a946e2890bf1f6a5c5417.jpg"],[62197,"fallen into the ambush prepared two leagues from the fort: also there was the surgeon who was taken with me.  The Onnondagas had prepared a sacrificial pile at the instigation of the English we have XXXXXXX to the four nations, and they had no one whom they could throw upon this pile who would animate the courage of the warriors. Finally the resolution was taken to place us at the disposition of the Onnontans that they might themselves choose the one whom they should decide as the most suited for their designs.  Most probably I should have","1d7c9590da063614610cfb1645a09728.jpg"],[62198,"been the one chosen, not only to have put me to death would have been in accordance with a war without mercy, much as they seemed to desire, but also that I was generally considered a great criminal by the Iroquois and the English.\nOne day, at noon, a chief of Onneida came for me and led me bound as I was to a council of the Iriquois nations assembled upon a hill near by.\nThey placed me near the surgeon whom I found in the position of a prisoner of war as well as myself.  The two other captives","7fe0cfefbeb1a9a8cf32fd29e265ee1a.jpg"],[62199,"could not be found, for those who had them in their custody took them on a hunting expedition, taking their captives with them.  I am of the opinion that this caused the disbanding of the party and saved me this time from the danger threatening me.\nWe are not all assembled - said an old savage of Goiugoen (Cayuga?), and after having regarded me for sometime, he told me to pray to God.  I desired to know if it was because I was to die, he said \"no,\" only I must pray to God according to my custom.  I then rose up and made my","b582f2636153dac2ac3534739f88115e.jpg"],[62200,"prayer in Iroquois in order that all present might understand me.  I did not forget to pray particularly for my listeners.  My prayer finished, they caused me to sit down again, while they unbound one of my arms, and shortly after led me to the village of the Onneidas.  Scarcely had I arrives there when several of the people came to testify their great at seeing me again.  \nThey had had great concern for me and assured me that they had not taken part in the council held which had in consideration the plan for giving me up to the","a89068897abeac7caa4e9e432a7f46c1.jpg"],[62201,"Onnandagas.

At the last camping place, about ten leagues from Onneida, I met a Christian squaw who gave me from her father and mother a large chaplet of beads strung on brass wire with a beautiful medallion of St. Famille.

I refer to the Hungry Hill campaign in which you relieved or saved A. J. Smiths command from capture or starvation.  Genl. Ruful Ingalls {{Acht?]] is here,   tells me that Genl.

At any rate there is not a word about the Rogue river war in either the Post or Department records.\nI know that A. J. Smith had a fight with {{illegible]] Indians in the fall or winter of 1858 & that in the Spring of 1856, that a force war sent down to relieve him & I think you were in command. Can you not give me an account of that war & the part you had in it.  Was Lieut. Kautz along & what if any thing did the Oregon Volunteers do?\n\n                                             I am Genl. Sincerely\n                                                  Thomas M.

He thinks such a post should be established there at once, and directed me to so write to you for the information of the General in Chief.  There are two companies of 2d Cavalry now there.  The new post should be near where Major Gordon had his recent fight with Indians.  The post should really be for three companies:  two of cavalry, and one of infantry, to take the place of Fort Bridger, now no longer necessary, except to make its quarters available for troops in winter.\n    If I am authorized to build this post, I will go there at once, and locate it, and can then give exact information concerning supplies to be obtained in vicinity.  All I can say now certainly is that such a post is needed.\n    Camp Brown, at the Shoshonee Agency, is about thirty five miles northeast of the point where this post should be.","dcd6fb263b48d27d892a61f2df524472.jpg"],[68634,"Copy\nHEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PLATTE,\nOMAHA, NEBRASKA, May 28th 1870.\nBrevet Major General E. D. Townsend\nAdjutant General U S Army\nWashington, D. C.\nGeneral:\n\n                 Red Cloud and his party are to pass here today on their way to Washington to see the President.  While I think it very desirable that Red Cloud should be confirmed in what seems to be his present friendly disposition, I feel it my duty to state my opinion that, however successful the Government may be in doing this, it will be no mans stop Indian depredations on the plains.  I do this as I see by the papers, that an impression prevails at the East that Red Cloud is the head and front of all the hostile bands.  Nothing can be further from the truth.  His band is not a large one, and I have reason to believe that during the past year has not been a very troublesome one.  I cannot, of course, be certain of this, but I am almost certain that most of the Indian troubles in this Department for the past two years have come from the Minnecanjous  - the Northern Cheyennes - the irregular bands heretofore on the Republican under \"Pawnee Killer\", \"Whistler\", and other, and","2fd79fe7ad7225df0ca3097a65d8d2bc.jpg"],[68635,"probably part of the Northern Arrapahoes, with a sprinkling of Unkpapa's, and others from the North.\nRed Cloud cannot control any of these bands, and his influence with them will be no greater than that of Spotted Tail.  I think it will be found that any Chief or Headman, who becomes friendly to the whites, will cease to exert any influence over the hostiles, unless of his immediate family.\nThe Sioux are divided into some eighteen different bands, all independent of each other, and without a controlling authority in any one of them.\nThe introduction amongst them of what is known as \"Soldiers\", has impaired, and in many cases entirely destroyed the authority of the legitimate chiefs.  A successful Headsoldier can at all times control the fighting men of the band, and through them the band itself, and it not unfrequently happens that this control is divided between two or three soldiers.  The complications arising from this system are endless, and very embarrassing in any effort to master the Indian question.  Red Cloud himself is not a legitimate chief, only a successful soldier of the Ogallala band, and even in his immediate band his authority is divided with his brother \"Long Chin\", another successful soldier.\nI have taken the liberty to write the above that no undue expectations may be formed from any amicable arrangements made with Red Cloud.  But while I doubt this ability to do","fe01c5fcc92c5f009ba2a80f0cb7c6b9.jpg"],[68636,"much good, there is no question that he could do a great deal of harm if so disposed, and if, by any arrangement, this can be prevented and he be induced to exert what influence he has for peace, a good deal will have been accomplished.\n\n                             I am, General,\n                               Very Respectfully\n                                   Your obedient servant,\n                 (signes)             C.

No officer, however long he may have served knows the necessities, and workings of the Army except from his own particular standpoint which is necessarily limited to the narrow range of his own experience and observation.  Within this range his views may be consistently sound, but still if adopted generally, as all changes must be  they might work a grave injury in a quarter beyond his vision, and in a matter of which he was totally ignorant.\n\n   The only exceptions to this, are the cases of the General and the Lieutenant General of the Army.  They are supposed to know, and I believe they do, the condition of the Army in all its bearings, and are competent to endorse generally as to its requirements.\n   While I am in entire sympathy with the efforts made to reduce the expenses of the government, and cannot doubt the purity of the motives of those who extend\n(over)","cc19fba251b707b33572f4942f9b10ba.jpg"],[68680,"3\nthem yearly in the direction of the Army, I am quite sure that it has a most discouraging and disheartening effect upon officers, and necessarily impairs the efficiency of the service.  I have served in the Army for nearly thirty three years, mostly on the frontier, and have filled every grade in it from a Brevet Second lieutenant to my present rank of Brigadier General.  Since January 1867, I have been continuously in the Indian Country until less than a year ago when I was, - for my sins, [strike 3 words] transferred to this Department, and I am thoroughly familiar with the manner of life of troops on the frontier; I know all about the hardships and the privations they are subjected to, - the thousand expenses attending frequent removals and which no one outside knows anything, - the scrupulous avoidance of debt, and the struggles and devices to escape it, and worse than all - more wearing and trying - is the annual apprehension, [2 word underline] inevitable as fate, which comes upon all,\n(over)","9047161412c4f8de02bb01044c179e85.jpg"],[68681,"that the meagre provisions they have barely been able to make for the comfort of their families, and the education of their children may all be broken up by a reduction of their pay; or else, by some reduction of the Army, they be thrown altogether out of service.\n\n   The Army in our Country must always be small, but I think it should be of the very best, (Good Lord deliver us from [strike 5 words]  may our country be spared the perils and danger of a cheap Army:) and [strike]   The advantages attending its Service [strike 3 words]  attached to those who serve in it should be such as to induce our brightest your men to engage therein.

I should be glad therefore to have the record of the proceedings of the Court examined again by the Judge Advocate General of the Army, and if anything is found there to confirm Captain Foulk's impressions, that it be corrected.\n\nMy wish has been and is now, that full justice shall be down both to Capt Foulk, and to the service.  I have known him since 1867, when he first joined his regt, and during the time I have never had his integrity questioned, and have always understood & believed that his is certainly free from disruptive ? habits.","aba16f32f98b9f88b19374c5a704be67.jpg"],[68776,"HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,\nFort Leavenworth, Kansas, June 25th, 1885.\nMy dear Welcher,\n\n                                I have received your letter of the 3d inst., and am very much gratified that you should have though of me in connection with the very important position of President of your State University.

I lay very little stress in newspaper reports in general, but when they report calamities occuring in a vicinity near some loved one of mine then I am awakened to inquire if there be any truth in it -- for they do so often tell a tale today and deny it on the morrow that I have very little confidence in the daily news therefore spend very little time in looking them over, but while I was ironing my grey dress, I had on at your house -- for I have ripped & washed it and Mary Thomas is to make it over for me this week, Marcia read aloud the Saturday Globe","3cfb28afaf573bd72cad85723b9b8377.jpg"],[31502,"report of the western cyclones, it spoke of great damage to Ypsilanti and other towns in Mich, but no name I was so familiar.

I have been fighting a cold with ginger tea hot at bed time, then forget it in the day time and do some imprudent thing.

There is deep snow in Steuben yet. Dr. Palmer was called to see Dave Price one day last week, had to go up the hill on horseback, coming down for the nine o'clock train the horse missed his footing stepping into a slush hole threw the doctor over his head into a snow bank &c &c.

M. and she came right on, so I sent for the doctor and nurse (whom she had engaged for a week or two) as she thought I was not strong enough to have all the care of her & babe at first. The pains were hard & frequent almost constant, but not expulsive. About half past nine the doctor applied forceps without effect. At half past ten we telephoned for Dr. Kilborn and at two o'clock after the hardest struggle I ever saw with all my experience, the child was brought into the world. A large head, well formed body with a growth of four or six weeks. That with a narrow pelvis was the cause of all the trouble. To all appearance the child was still born, but one of the doctors and the","11ba63541f76a0115c352b7386195d49.jpg"],[31511,"nurse went to work to breathe it into life, its lungs were filled, its eyes, beautiful ones like Mr Williams, opened when it was plunged into a bath of very warm water but the breathing only lasted while they worked over it. Dr. Palmer and I took care of Jo, poor girl, her suffering was not so intense because of chloroform though she did suffer dreadfully from the first pains. She is very weak and kept very quiet. Only Mr Williams besides the nurse & myself go into the room, since early yesterday morning. The disappointment is very keen, both to her & Mr Williams. I had no idea he would feel so to lose it, but I knew how much she alloted on having a baby, and a boy too was just what she wanted. It was perfect in form and the prettiest face I ever saw on a new infant, others say the same, its face was round & fat, little legs & arms plump","92c51bdc37b78df95e3ded50d07d943e.jpg"],[31512,"hands & feet perfect. Jo. did not see it at all, was too sick at first and it was taken to Franks room where we had a little wood stove up for the occasion, of course it was not dressed till after it stopped breathing and we feared to let her see it and advised that she better not for her own good. It was buried this morning in Eddie's grave. The minister & wife came here before church to make a prayer and soon after, Rob't & Marcia and Miss Bedford (who came yesterday as soon as she heard of it) took the little casket in a carriage to the cemetery. Everything was done very quietly just to give the little one a Christian burial and not excite the mother. We shall be very anxious for a few days but hope for the best.

It is probably all for the best, but as Mr Williams says, hard to understand. I could not grieve for the child, though we are all sadly disapointed but I am so sorry for the parents. They had both anticipated so much at this late day in their life. Jo. had said if she died she wanted me to have the care of the child, but she never seemed to think the child might not live, for she planned all her living for nine months to the end that she might bring forth a well developed, healthy child -- a large fat baby she used to say, without knowing what she said, had it been puny, small, it might have come all right\nAm very tired, will such parted ? later if I do not forget.

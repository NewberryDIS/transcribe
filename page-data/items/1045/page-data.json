L. suggest 16 Mar 1846 (A)     \nConfidential suggestions as to how the Treaty with the Pottawotamies may be made viz:              March 1846\nSent Maj'r. Andrews & one or two other persons with him as Commissioners or send him alone if you think best.  Sent him because he knows exactly what was agreed on here last fall, & because [underline] the Indians asked him to go & to take with him that paper (meaning the written proposal)\n\n    Send up when you please, say in June, July or August.  The best time would be when the payment was ready to be made, that would be the proper time, & would salve expenses to the U. S.  Let Maj'r. Andrews take up with him some troops from Fort Leavenworth, say 20 to 30 mounted men, to keep order, Keep whiskey dealers, mischief makers & loafers out of the Indian Country.   The U. S. Flag should be exhibited & Maj'r. Andrews should appear among them in his uniform, so as to  command respect and make the proper impression.  I have seen much of these Indian negotiations, & this would be my plan\n    Let your Instructions be as broad & liberal as you can so as to cover entirely the proposition.\n    Leave the Nation fully at liberty to set apart and provide money out of their $850, 000, to pay their debts.  Let them have upon the ratification of the Treaty, say 80 to $100.000 - for this object. It might be put in the Treaty \"payable to the principal chiefs, or to some person as Trustee, for the purpose of enabling the nation to settle their affairs \"and with this the nation can pay their debts.-\n    Let the Treaty provide for perfecting their Titles to those former\n                     \n                                                                             [in pencil]  *box Ayer MS 3067","d9bbd5bf723000d88fb4708d7989eb98.jpg"],[69645,"reserves as prayed for by the Indians and as recommended by major Harvey\n\n      To this & to their paying their own debts out of their own money I find every Senator with whom I have spoken are favorably disposed and this they will consent to, if  they even do not modify the resolution.\n       With these latitudes, & by obviating these restrictions I think the Treaty can be made, but not without [underline] them, in my humble opinion, I do not think I am mistaken in this.  Send along Maps shewing the Kanzas lands you have bot, and that they can have their 585, 000 acres (more or less) as they may wish, on both sides of the Kanzas river, West of & adjoining the Shawnees & Delawares.  State what it will cost them, the amt. to be deducted from their $850, 000, and all other things as\n\nset forth in the proposition.\nThe Comrs. should repair first to Council Bluff Councill and Treat with those upper Bands first.  Then come down to the lower Band, and they will concur.  Do not go to the lower Indians first, nor do not assemble the upper & lower Indians together. If you do it will create difficulty and perhaps defeat the treaty.\n\n  Let the Comrs. give the appointment of Secry to the Treaty to Majr. Richd. L. Elliott.  This will bring him in aid of the negociation.  He can, and will be very useful, those Indians & especially so the upper Bands have implicit confidence in him.  Thus organized we can consummate that matter to your liking, I will go & render every assistance in my power - $500 or $1000 - worth of provisions will be required above, and about the same amt. below to be issued whilst","24cbc4c8521858e7374c016f9c4224b9.jpg"],[69646,"the Indians are counselling.  It will occupy ten to 15 days above & a week at the Osage river Agency.  If the Hon. Comrs. Indn. Affairs will excuse me for this presuming to make these suggestions I will be gratified.  He know the position & relation we occupy & will I trust appreciate my motives.  Allow me to say again, this plan, if adopted & wisely executed will succeed.  It shall at any rate have my hearty, though humble support, and I will co-operate with your Comrs. if desired so to do.\n\n    I will be in the City of St. Louis on or before the 1st of June with my family, and if you will honor me with your confidence, and drop me a line or tell Major Andrews to do so when you get ready to move in this matter I will hold myself in readiness to go up & co-operate with your Comrs. refer to Maj'r. Harveys report of 12 July last, you will there see what he says of me.  Your local Agent at the Bluff could be told to inform those upper Bands a month before hand so they could be got together.  They scatter off at great distances.  The lower Bands are always close at hand, easy to assemble.\n    In view of this treaty being closed up this year, I would not advise any changes or new division in the payment of their present years annuities.  It would create hard feelings and perhaps make trouble with the Upper Bands.\n    The lower Bands will be very well satisfied to have it all thrown into a common annuity after this year under the new Treaty, so to insure harmony I would recommend that no changes be made as to their annuities this year.\n\n                                                                              2\n\n                                                                                                                                                      [in pencil]  * box Ayer MS 3067","dfd0c11aaea6265b83379d7dc32638d6.jpg"],[69647,"It has been the practice to pay all these Indians more or less, 5 Frank silver pieces, large amounts of these French dollars have been sent to Indian payments.  This is wrong & I think the Superintendant at St. Louis should be instructed to see that no Agent ever takes a 5 Frank dollar the Missouri Bank.  It works great injustice to those in the trade, and the Supert. should stop it.  They should have Dollars, Eagle, half dollars, and American quarters.  But no 5 Frank, no Dutch Thales, nor no ten cent pieces.  I hope you will not forget to make such an order, without saying that it was spoken of by me.\n    These views are confidential.  They are based upon my long & intimate acquaintance with, and knowledge of these Indians and experience will shew that I am not mistaken in them.\n    I pray you will not think me obtrusive, my only object is to see the matter consummated and our rights provided for\n                                With great respect\n                                    Yr.

It is just what we have dreaded all winter until the edict of abdication and Yuan's election to the Presidency made us cease to dread it. We felt that the Republic being peacefully launched all would be well in China. There would be difficulties, of course, but having overcome so many, no thought","3f334fc0137bec3e4fc8b330bce9e68b.jpg"],[48525,"2/\nthey would seem small. The whole city was gay with the five-color flag of the Republic. For Tuesday we'd seen making calls for the Chinese New Year or some of the Man-Chu princesses whose I did not like to desert just because they were out of power. Polly went with me on Wednesday to see the Princess Jhai Hsiin, whose children are cousins of the Son of Heaven, and the Princess Tsai Chèn at old Prince Ching's palace. And on Thursday we saw Princess Pù Lun and Princess Kala-Chin, who is a Mongol and takes the situation by hand. I call her the suffragette because she has been interested in politics","c80a636a2ecc19fa2b3259ad50746c2e.jpg"],[48526,"3/\nand has done so much for women. She reminded me that I knew how democratic and progressive she had been, but she thinks this situation hopeless as it means inevitably, to her, the partition of China. A fate from which a constitutional monarchy, she thought, would have saved the country. I tried to reassure her but she was too far down in the depths, and I had great respect for her in her despair. \nFrom there I went to see Mme. Hoo, whose husband is acting Minsister of Foreign Affairs and close to Yuan, and found her of -","cd47589c57b921b5b6928b2b408151f2.jpg"],[48527,"4\ntimism (optimism) a great (esalract) of the other. After we came home the Straight and others came in and stayed while we went up to dress about half past seven. As I descended the stairs, again a little before eight, I saw Major Purcell in the hall. He asked about Cal and I told him he was dressing and would be down in a moment. Then the Thunderbolt fell. He said there were riots around Hetaman and a three-inch shell had fallen in our Guard compound. If it had exploded it might have killed fifty men. He rushed up stairs, two at a time to report to Cal, + as soon","af52dd0790e1b3b8444d71ae253afe69.jpg"],[48528,"5\nas he left the house then minutes later the Call to Arms was sounded. From that time on the excitement was wild. Cannons were brought out, barricades were built, a gun was mounted on the roof of our kitchen, our soldiers advanced and took possession of Chien Wen which is vastly important from a strategic standpoint, and in a moment we were on a war fooding. We heard the firing very plainly in several directions, sometimes very loud and close, and from the upper windows we could see the smoke and flames of a line of","8cfe3c72c5313c7f4d5714688bc5e841.jpg"],[48529,"6\nfires which rapidly increased in number. The most terrifying side of it was the fact that the rioting and looting were the work of the army soldiers whom Yuan had brought in to protect the city, and their officers were taking part in it. Cal's orderly reported that he had been on Liberty at the Y. M. C A. on Hatamen St. when the alarm was given, and the American marines came pouring down Segation St. back to quarters. They had seen the Chinese soldiers breaking the windows of the shops on Hatamen and looking them at this point of this","3ecb412fdf851dfeff0e62a6f8a6511f.jpg"],[48530,"7/\nbayonet. Cal was everywhere in the compound with the officers though bullets were falling here and there and one of them whizzed close by him. We thought that the Straights and the Wenscals were dining at Casenave's in the quarter and were at ease about this until I sent the orderly and found they were not there. (Willis) riding pell-mell though quite unaccustomed to it had gone after the Ferguson Family + brought them in. They were at the west of the quarter where it was still quiet. But a squad of soldiers under St. Randall","86d4b1eefcacfe7217f3fc416df8b078.jpg"],[48531,"8\nwas sent for the Straights on the other side + the (Monroes) who were near the fires and in the midst of the looting, and another squad under Capt. Kipp for the Thatchers who were in a still more dangerous position. We waited in great anxiety for them to come in. Finally we thought we saw them coming preceded by rickshaws piled high with luggage. We rushed out only to be greeting by a \"Here I am\", in the voice of Mrs. Matrell as though it was she alone that we had been waiting for. And her mother interrupted our anxieties by telling us how much she had been wanting to see me ec, ec. They ad followed the British troops","f620757e9a6fbcac924cdf69eb1adc34.jpg"],[48532,"9/\nwith the Jordan Mission people. Ten or fifteen minutes later came the de Menscals + then the Straights. They had had a terrifying time. Willard (Mr. Straight) had taken Dorothy (Mrs. Straight) into Dr. Morrison's which seemed a little safer. Many Chinese took refuge there and among them one soldier who said he did not want to join the looting. (He has since been given twenty (taels) as a reward and promoted to be a corporal.) The de Menssal's house is on the main street and for two hours they sat there in terrified expectation of an attack. The shooting was thick around them and at the shops across the street were being looted,","9a21cedceee564cba422e3b69b550dec.jpg"],[48533,"10/ \nSeveral times there were violent knocks on their door, but the fact that it was the house of an American left them out, for foreigners seemed to be immune. But they wondered at what desperate moment this immunity might cease and they feared the fires which were very close. It was with enormous relief that they heard the soldiers at the door. they had spread sheets on the floor + emptied the closets and then the bureau drawers into them, so that Dan's boots were carried with Beatrice's powder and mixed up indiscriminiately with ballgowns.","a88028b103f126084d49f354945761cf.jpg"],[48534,"11/\nWe took them all in. The Millers were already here as it happened, so their house went to the Matrells and we took the Straights and the de Menscals. When the Patchins arrived they went to Summy's and the Ferguson's had gone to the Runes. Mr. Patchins had tried three times to get out of the little street where they live, but the bullets were too thick. Finally he gave his telegrams to a coolie with a five-dollar tip in the desperate hope that they might reach his paper. We stayed up until two, watching the fires, distributing coffee and sandwiches to the officers","334424b393aa87d2f525e70b7c01b177.jpg"],[48535,"12/\nand refugees who came and went, discussing this new phase of the situation, listening to the firin. The next day it was fairly quiet, but that night much the same thing happensd again. Yuan had issued a manifesto - a kind of apology, but it had no effect. Saturday the diplomats decided to bring up more troops from Tient-sin, and Sunday morning at 9, 200 American soldiers marched into the compound with all their equipment. It was good to see them. They have been sent out to guard the Missions. Things have quieted down now. Yuan's soldiers have been sent out of town on","eb608aafcd1d40703b280053a0962d74.jpg"],[48536,"13/\nconfined in their barracks, decapitations are going on all over the city, and the Man-Chu police are guarding the streets. Poor Yuan is terribly depressed. The day after that first awful night he admitted that the officers took part in the looting and said 'I have not been in touch with these soldiers for five years. They bear the same names but they are not the same men.\" \nDo not worry about us. We are quite safe and sheltered here and we would not have missed the excitement, as long as it had to be, for anything.","95eed84e445b579f591cb0600eaad9ba.jpg"],[48537,"14/\nPoor old China, I am afraid she will have to suffer in the course of liberty.

As the telegram answering my arrival had gone astray, I found myself quite unexpected and was obliged to go into luncheon alone and introduce myself not only to one general but five! It was overpowering for a few brief moments but as they were very gallant and cordial, I got on fairly well. The French housekeeper, as it happened, was away for a few days, and","90b649f515bc9e6b9bb76400a4b60855.jpg"],[48566,"found myself the confidant of several difficulties and disagreements between her and others and the Red Cross girls who have charge fo the officer's club proposition at Le Mans. I applied as far as possible the grand principle of ignoring the difficulties and thereby largely smoothing them out. Whether I can do any practical permanent good by being here is another matter. With the generals here it is quiet, but they seem to want a woman around. A contrast is it not to men's clubs at home. The seonc day after I arrived one of them was taken ill with pneumonia and clung to me like a drowning man until the doctors took him away to a hospital.

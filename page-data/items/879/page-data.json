The matter mentioned in your Note has long since been settled in my mind, for I resolved when I came to Cala never to return home, unless I could add to instead of diminish mothers worldly comforts, to that end, all my efforts have been directed, and will continue to be as long as I have no one depending upon me, and that will in all probability be a good while, as I have no unfinished affairs of the heart, on hand, at present, nor dont expect to have for some time to come.  As it regards our portion of the Property bequeathed to us, by our Sister.  It was understood by mutual consent between Jack & Frank and myself, that it should never be touched during mothers lifetime unless it were to place it in a condition","d30320bd58ea05d55ce150f3262da9f1.jpg"],[55579,"more advantagious to her own benefits I took the necessary steps sometime ago to place my portion of the Estate beyond the reach of my heirs executors or assigns, as long as mother lives, by deeding to her, during her lifetime for her use and benefit all my right title and interest in the Estate.  For should I become involved or die involved, my creditors could come upon my portion of the property for my debts? and as soon as I can hear from home, and obtain the necessary information particularising the property, the deed will be forwarded to mother to be placed on record, in the proper office.  I wish I had 30? times as much to give her.  I would die just that much the better contented.  For I have a profession that has not failed to yield me a support as yet, and when it does I have a pair of hands which are as able to work, as they were three years ago.  We have invested some means in loosing operations in the way of mining, but the one we are engaged in at present I hope will more than remunerate us for what we have lost, though all mining operations are more or less uncertain.  Our Practice last year amounted to about $12,000 a good deal of which of course we will not collect","5473224379c808e07d8c6f00a0d9bbdc.jpg"],[55581,"This year it will not be near so good, as it has so far been the healthiest season since the discovery of Gold in Cala.  The greatest error I have committed in this country has been in not sending money home as fast as I could get 100$, had I done so I might now have a handsome sum laid up; for it is the most uncertain of all other countries for the safe investment of funds in all speculation\nAs a general thing, what I have made in one way I have lost in another speculation of some kind or another, and I have about concluded that if our present mining speculation proves a failure, not to send any more good money after bad, but stick to the Practice alone, for I beleve we have the confidence of the people sufficiently to give us a practice where there is any to do.  I need hardly say, that I am practising allopathy for I suppose you knew that, long ago.\nI expect to be at home one of these days, though I dont know when but as soon as circumstances will permit to my satisfaction.  I wish I could be with you and all our friends today It would afford me more happiness than I have enjoyed for 3 1/2 years all together.  Write to me soon, and often.\nAs ever your affectionate\nNephew, Thomas J.

It found us all enjoying most excellent health, which has been our good fortune as a general thing ever since we came to the country.  We returned to this place nearly 3 months ago but have not thus far been near so fortunate as we were on the Yuba River & in fact we have been sinking money more or less ever since we came down here the last time.  We have shares now in a water & mining company which will soon be in operation, we completed our part of the work yesterday we take the water from this place, in a ditch or canal, to the next mining town below, a distance of nearly 7 miles.  If the Diggins there are as rich as it is supposed they are it will be as profitable an investment as we could have made, on the same amount of capital for besides getting water for our own mining operations, each shareholder will have more or less water to sell to other miners.  We expect to move down as soon as the water gets there; so that we can go to mining.  We have spent a good deal of time in prospecting for Quartz veins & the company discovered one some weeks ago, that is supposed\n[written along left margin]\nof any proffits accruing, & in such case whatever it might be I told mother & sister to receive it & appropriate it to their use & seeing the advertisement, I casually mentioned the matter in a letter home for I thought it even more likely that they would also see the advertisement than that I should & I know that if they did unless they knew something about, the cause they might be uneasy & think strange after what had passed on the subject\n[written along top margin]\nI am sorry that the matter has been so misconstrued and am still more surprised to think you should think that I did it out of any ill will towards you for nothing was farther from my mind.  I cant see that I have done any thing in the matter that is not compatible with strict principles of honor.  I remarked that I supposed it was your choice for the land to be sold in that way, from the fact that I supposed it had probably depreciated in value & never intimated that it was in consequence of any pecuniary embarrassment or any thing of the kind, and as to doing it with the intention of making public your business matters, as you supposed, I never dreamed of any such thing For I suppose they know as much as they do from anything I may have told? them","7f71235ea5cbf0cf4fbed569d3b401b7.jpg"],[55586,"to be rich, But whether it will pay for working at the present prices of machinery labour &c or not is yet to be decided and in fact that is the case with nearly every species of mining, you have to risk a good deal in order to make any thing of consequence.  Gold mining from beginning to end is a perfect gambling business, if you loose at all you are very apt to loose all you invest & if you make any thing it is apt to be something worth having; a miner may be rich to day and in a few weeks he may not be worth a dollar and work like a negro all the time.  I have not done any thing at my profession since we left Washington; for it is rather inconvenient to attend to the Practice of Physic & dig in the earth at the same time; we will continue, mining as long as we remain in the country.\nWe reced a letter from Mother yesterday, they had not heard of the death of Corydon Oliver; poor fellow he struggled hard in this country, to indemnify himself for his trip and after going through all that he did it seems hard for him to be cut off when so near the goal to which he was anxiously hastening.  The health of this country generally, is very good & the the climate surpasses any I ever experienced.  If every thing else in this country equaled the climate I should be conted to remain here as long as I live.\nBut so long as the gold mines are here, just so long will society be corrupt.  I was perfectly astounded when I heard of the affair between yourself & Stille, for I thought, he above all others would be the last man to injure you in any way, & ?less be guilty of the charges alleged against him; it appears that we know no one untill we have tried them fully & even\n[written along left margin]\nI feel convinced that you will think differently of the matter after the explanations above made and that this will be the last misunderstanding of the kind that will ever occur between us.  May prosperity and success in all your enterprises be your greatest curse.   still yours &c T.J O.","f2199effae35da4e31788e3cb405e154.jpg"],[55588,"I beleive that human nature is so frail, that it wont do to rely upon.  But it is almost proverbial for the Californians to entertain a very poor opinion of human nature & in reality they have sufficient cause for men in this country who stood fair in the States?; will steal, swindle & in short do any thing for a little gold dust.  I have never seen or heard of Stille in this country but if he ever should approach me, I shall most certainly give him cause to remember me.  I think if he has come to this country, that he has taken up his quarters in San Francisco or Sacramento City where he can better carry on his villainous schemes.\nI recd a letter a short time ago from Mr Chapman, he was well and wished to be remembered to you, both, he is also mining & has done tolerably well only & expects to remain for 12 months longer.  I shall return to the States this fall if I live, as soon as the sickly season is over on the Isthmus which will be probably some time in November.\nJack & Frank talk of remaining a little longer, though they are not determined.  Frank is quite grown and is one of the steadiest old men in the country.  Jack is the same old 7 & 6 through he looks a good deal altered from exposure and hard labour, he is never sick a day, nor never appears to feel tired at night.  Uncle Harvey? I wish you would advise mother what to do with the tumors on Ghol's head she wrote me an imperfect account of the matter & from the rapidity with which she says they grow, I feel very uneasy about him, from the fact of his being so young and at the same time growing so rapidly.  I am induced to beleive that they are nothing more than adipose tumors though they appear to be in\n[written along left margin]\nIf I could think of any thing else to write, I would write it on this blank margin.  But I dont know what to say, and I still dont like for the letter to go off without being full -- As we have no romantic adventures in this country our fund of news is necessarily small.","84dac89d123d1a4f8e0c9e7ab2eabafe.jpg"],[55591,"rather a singular location, for any thing of that kind but you can better judge of that matter when you have a more correct statement of the case.  Aunt Sophia, I hardly know how to thank you for the kind admonitions, contained in your letter, but you may rest assured that they will not soon be forgotten; on the contrary we will treasure them up and try to profit by them, for there is not place in the world, where good advice from a friend, is more needed than it is here.  There is no restraint whatever upon the actions of men & the greatest wonder wonder is that affairs are not worse than they are.  As a sample of the way things are carried on I will give you a specimen of what I saw on last Sunday afternoon, Sunday you must know is the principle business day of the week.  On one square in the main business part of the city -- a minister mounted an empty goods box to preach a sermon to the crowd, as he said he could not get a congregation large enough to preach to at the church which was recently erected & while he was preaching 3 large gambling houses with splendid bands of music were in full blast within a few doors & the gingling of the specie on the monte tables & the sound of the music formed a strange contrast when compared with the voice of the minister preaching to the motley crowd in the open street while from numerous waggons loaded with goods men were auctioneering off the remnants of their stock.  The next thing worthy of note was a crowd rushing out of one of the gaming houses pell mell some drunk & some sober, some bloody and others with their coats off ready for a fight, which had been commenced in the house and as usual ends in the street.  Such scenes as these and many others are nothing unusual; of a Sunday more especially, but you can have no proper conception of these things unless you were here to see for yourself & that of course would be the last thing you would think of.\nJack & Frank wish to be remembered most affectionately to you both & say they will write soon.  Give my respects to Helen and to all enquiring friends; be sure to write soon, and believe me to be as ever                 your affectionate nephew\n\n                                                                                    Thomas J. Oxley.\n\nDr. T.? N. Oliver\nMrs Sophia Oliver\nP.S. I think uncle Harvey, if I know myself as I believe I do that you laboring under a false impression in regard, to the reference, made to the sale of the Columbia Property, in one of my letters home & I think you will certainly be of a different opinion when the matter is explained, for I am not in the habit of doing things underhandedly or without an assignable cause or reason, and as to my being ungenerous or ungrateful to you or any one else for any favours or assistance, I may have recived & more especially as it regards yourself, for you ought to know me well enough, to know that I shall allways (let my circumstances in life be what they may) consider myself largely indebted to you in point of gratitude at least.  I will here give you the reason why I did it & hope it will be satisfactory.  When I was starting to California last spring after I had told mother & sister the actual state of my affairs, they asked me as well as I can recollect, if I had any thing left in Cincinnati & I told them I had not but that some time during the fall or winter previous you had offered me 60 or 100$ for my services or interest of 20 per cent on the proffits & that I told you, (which you probably recollect) that I thought you would not be doing justice to yourself to give that much & so the matter rested.  I then told them that when you sold the lots, if they paid a proffit amounting to anything of consequence over & above expenses & if your other land speculations proved very profitable & you saw proper to allow me any thing on it you could do so, but that of course was to be discretionary with you for I did not consider you indebted to me at all.  But in the event of my death before my return & in case I should leave no effects, you could allow me something, if you saw proper in case \n[written along left margin]\nWhen you write direct to Sacramento City as before and we will get the letter from there by Express.","1c178b82abde5b7f1408930e86592ab5.jpg"],[55594,"Crescent City Hotel,\nSacramento City, California, August 27th 1850\nDear Aunt,\nI hardly know whether I ought to write to you or Uncle Harvey at all or not, as I have written to both of you several times since I left the Queen City & have never recd the first scratch of a pen from any of you & in fact I have not reced a line even from home.  I had thought that of course I would hear from you all as soon as I reached this City but the mail which just arrived from the States brought every one something except me.  I reached here 2 days ago very much fatigued after an over land journey of 105 days during which time I underwent a great deal of Hardship & suffering, but all to no effect for I stood it much better than I had expected My health has been extremely good in fact better than usual.  I find gold pretty plenty in this country but not so easily come at as many suppose But I think that in the next 12 or 18 months I will at least make an effort for a few thousand.  Sacramento City is ahead of any thing I ever saw in my life 12 months ago there were","867ca6bda20cc2be6a9f51a15c15b168.jpg"],[55597,"a few persons here probably not more than 1000 & they were living mostly in Cotton Tents.  Now there are between 35 & 45 thousand inhabitants living in well constructed & some of them pretty fine Frame & Brick buildings.  We have all that is desirable in the way of eating & that of the best the finest melons & pears that I ever tasted & at a reasonable price.  I have seen more dissipation & vice in the last 2 days than I ever saw in 10 times the same length of time in my life, every possible inducement is offered to decoy men into dissipation & gambling & many a poor fellow after he has labored hard for a fortune; is caught in their net & soon finds himself pennyless\nAny time during the day or night you can see by walking up one of the principal streets as much as from 50 to 100 Bushels of gold & silver coin stacked up on the tables of the monte dealers.  Business is very much over done here in the city but in the smaller towns in the mines there are many good openings for business & trading.  I shall leave here this evening for a Place called Washington City & shall probably winter in that vicinity or on Feather River Frank arrived safe some 10 days ahead of me & has gone to join Jack who is also","64a1fded60c142daf4e3bae2d74df78c.jpg"],[55600,"well.  They are both at Washington.  I have not seen Frank since he left Weston having never been able to overtake him.  If Uncle Harvey was here with a small capital, I have no doubt that he could make a fortune in a short time.  But I would not advise any one of my friends to come to this country as long as they are making a living at home\nAs to my part I have not found the trip over the Plains half as hard as I expected & I feel in very good spirits & look forward with a good deal of confidence to the day when I shall have accomplished the object for which I came here & the moment that I have done that I shall take the first steamer to the Isthmus & thence to New York, be that time long or short.  I have not seen Mr. Chapman since I arrived he reached here some time ahead of me & was fortunate in doing so for the latter portion of the land emigration are & have been suffering immensely for the necessaries of life.  Although I did not suffer myself yet I saw hundreds who did some of whom had had not a morsel of bread for 48 hours.  In fact every person started with too small an allowance of Provisions & had it not been for the Donation of 30,000$ worth of Provisions by the citizens of Sacramento City to the suffering emigrants I hardly know what many of them would have done.  The cargo was sent 250 miles from here to meet them at the","c0fdfbb047d1a1a6ca8ede2e4fdeeee2.jpg"],[55603,"edge of the great Desert.  People were glad to get Flour by paying at the rate of 400$ per Barrel for it or 2$ per lb & every thing else in proportion.  But now that many of them have arrived they can get any thing they want in the way of good living.\nI would adise no man to come to California by land for the fatigue that they undergo & the anxiety about their animals is enough to break down the stoutest constitution.  As regards my own case I feel better than when I started by a great deal, although I have slept out in the open air without a tent ever since I left Ft. Laramie a distance of 1500 miles.  I have never had the first symptom of cold or any thing of the kind.  For 12 or 1400 miles of the rout we were in sight of snow (& often passed over it) every day.  I have many a time when I would sit down to a few hard crackers & a peice of salt meat broiled on the coals, thought of the many good dishes we have so often enjoyed together in that better land.\nI sometimes wonder that I did not give out on the trip, for although a mule is generally considered hard to kill, I broke down 4 diferent ones on the road for when I arrived in the City my 4th mule could not have gone 2 miles further.  Many others have fared much worse.  I consider myself very fortunate upon the whole any how.\nI should have sold myself to the museum when I arrived if there had been one in the place, for of all the horrible looking objects you ever saw I surpassed them all.  Tell Uncle Harvey that I am very anxious to learn how his Town Lot speculation turned out.  I am in hopes he has realised a handsome fortune out of it.  Tell him that he must write to me whenever he can & direct to Sacramento City as I will then be sure to receive it.  I wrote to him from Ft. Laramie but dont know whether he ever received it or not.\nMy respects to all the Ladies of my acquaintance both young & old & my acquaintances generally Give my love to Uncle Harvey and for yourself receive an ample share of my highest esteem.       Thomas J. Oxley\nP. S. Please ask Uncle Harvey to send me a Cincinnati paper occasionally.  I dont care much what kind, just so that I get some newspaper to day if I can ? it I will send him a Sacramento","6dd6a4f955ec51052097ac36a48966e8.jpg"],[55606,"Washington, South Yuba River, California\nWednesday night Nov. 27th 1850\nDear Mother, Sister & Brother,\nAs I am all alone to night & it has been some time since I wrote to you I thought I would spend the evening in that way.  Although I have nothing new or interesting to write; more than, that we are all enjoying fine health and getting along about as well as we could expect.  When I wrote to you last from Sacramento City we were then selling goods in Nevada City & I was down for the purpose of laying in a fresh supply, but when I returned to Nevada from the City I found that every thing was so much overdone in the way of trading (from the fact that every person that was able to go into such operations at all had flocked there for the purpose of going into business) that our safest plan was to sell out what we had on hand & go to mining again.  We had bought fixtures also for the purpose of setting up a Boarding House which we also sold out without much trouble We sold out every thing we had on hand except a house & lot in Nevada City which is yet unsold we will probably loose something on that as property has fallen very much since we bought.\n[written along left margin and top]\nI see by an advertisement in the Cincinnati Commercial that a suit has been brought against me & Uncle Harvey for the foreclosure of a mortgage that was on the Columbia Property.  I suppose from that that the lots were not likely to bring a proffit & Uncle Harv. prefered letting them make the money out of the land to paying if off and risk making himself safe which I expect is well enough for I feared that it would go down before another season to bring it into market","9cb19fabf742f9e9a976627e0b6d4af8.jpg"],[55609,"We have now been here about two weeks it is the same place that we did our first mining & we will remain here untill the River rises in the spring & as it is probable that the communication between here and the Sacramento Valley will be entirely cut off during the winter (from the immense depth of the snow on the mountains) you need not be uneasy if you do not hear from us again for 3 or 4 months but if at any time during the winter we find it at all practicable to get from here to Nevada City with a letter we will not fail to write.  The Snow will be packed sufficiently by the middle or last of February for persons to go over it on foot & the first opportunity we will be sure to write.\nThe rainy season is just beginning & there has already been a good deal of snow on the mountains in sight of us.  We have nearly all of our winter stock of provisions up & Jack will go down to Nevada City in a day or two & bring up another load which will complete our supply.  We have a very comfortable house & we have all learned to be such good cooks that we manage to live pretty comfortably on California fare, which at this time is not so bad, for we can get almost any thing that any one would wish in the way of eating with the exception of Eggs & milk.  We have not reced a letter from any of you since I was at Sacramento City but I suppose that there is one in the Express office at Nevada City by this time.  You must still direct your letters to Sacramento City as usual.","901a8daa6bee2c304c5e1f90ec3cafc0.jpg"],[55612,"I have not yet reced a line from Uncle Harvey or Aunt Sophia when you write to them tell them that I am still alive & my address is Sacramento City Cal -- I have not seen Clint Cockrill since he got in but I understood he was going home this winter.  People are leaving California now almost as fast as they came in last summer & the fact is there are too many people her for the extent of the mines.  Men are better satisfied now to work for 1/2 an ounce per day than they would have been last spring to work for 2 ounces.  The time for making large fortunes at mining or almost any thing else in Cal is about over yet I dont despair of of making some money this winter & during the coming spring.  I sometimes think of returning home in the spring or early in the summer but it may be that we shall not return untill fall but I think it is probable that I at least will return sooner.  it depends entirely upon our success mining this winter we have not been as well paid for our work since we came back to Washington as before we left it but I think we may probably strike something this winter that will pay well.  I worked half the day to day by myself & took out about 4$ Frank & I took out 18$ day before yesterday & I visited a patient this evening & made 5$ at that, unless he dies and dont leave money enough to pay my fees.

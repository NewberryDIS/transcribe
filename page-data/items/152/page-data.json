I have two sows that will have pigs, and I am going to make tight warm pens for them. I shall try to get old Mr. Bullock to lay off the work, and John Shafer will do most of the work as it is too cold and dry to shuck. We had no communication with the mail yesterday. To day Frank Evans is chopping wood for me. So I have three hands today. I think I can get the lumber on credit, till I sell my hogs. After I sell these four, I have six again that are pretty fat, and that I thought before I was sick would weigh nearly 250 lbs by Jan. 1, 1884. Orrin Lessenden has just been here.

This has been a very hot month. It has been cooler since the rain, but to day it is hot again but with a good South wind. I got your last letter Wednesday. I am very glad to hear so often. I find I have not yet learned to keep my letters so I can get hold of them, when I want to write back. I got a letter from cousin Mary Ann Saturday. She says it seems as if it rains twelve hours out of every twenty four. Clark's folks were all well. She said she was pretty well with the exception of a little rheumatism and neuralgia. She has a good tenant below. We are all in usual health here. Our corn crop is looking very well so far.

I often wonder how the language was preserved in such harmony when they did so much fighting. I know little of the Anglo Saxon tongue. How barren the English seems to be beside the Greek or Hebrew. Still we seem to get along very well. But do we not use more words to give definiteness and precision? I suppose Homer did a great deal to keep the Greek language in form as the Bible has done for the English.

There seems to be two days difference between the mail marks at Merrill & Osawatomie. I have not much to write about. only hot weather. We had two or three good rains about a week ago, and corn is looking well - a good many pieces backward on account of the peculiarly wet spring. I would like to see Bellamy's book Looking Backward. I can return it after reading. What is the political atmosphere in Michigan, or is it yet undeveloped? The Democratic talk about the force bill makes me mad. If I understand that bill it is to have two men appointed in every election district where a petition (signed by a required number of voters) is sent to a U.S. judge - that such judge shall appoint one Republican and one Democrat to report to Congress whether that election was conducted fairly. Is that statement fair? And on this they raise the cry \"Negro Domination.\" If I have","76711fcb714241fb2cafe03cab0f3c16.jpg"],[35460,"the right idea, it seems to me that here is a question above tariff or above money on which every honest man can have an opinion.

A room is darker when I come into the house from a bright light. I still read a great deal. I am getting the Inter Ocean again. The flood of talk is too great - it makes me think of a catch word to express a too abundant verbal flow lal-lal. That seems to be the greek λαλεω.

It has taken my strength. so I have neither churned nor milked for a few times, and perhaps can milk to night. We had a rain Monday, a hard rain Monday night, and a soft rain all Tuesday night. We are much encouraged about our corn, and fall crops. Nearly all corn is more or less late because of the very wet spring. Do you know what cousin Mary Ann used to make a sour drink. I cannot remember. I got Ginn & Co.s catalogue. But they","ce14fb0ff921a595c3e3489d4a06bdc9.jpg"],[35462,"sent the Common School instead of the College edition.

I am really glad you have had a pleasant vacation, and that your health has been benefitted so much. Be careful of your health now dear sister, and I think your health may be now first rate. I like the arrangement at South Hadley very much which compels the pupils to exercise so much. Let your walks seem as spontaneous to you as possible. Enjoy them as much as possible - not as tasks - but as every day renewed and inestimable privileges of going at your will, and wandering in the glorious picture gallery of our Heavenly Father. Under the blue Heavens, on the soft green grass, with trees waving their leafy honors around and on every side of us, \"all men meet together\" - \"God is the Maker of us all,m\" How admirably has he fitted us to enjoy nature, and made nature for our enjoyment. Many a little spot of deep blue sky guarded and environed by fleecy clouds will sometimes give me a feeling of happiness, almost an ecstasy of enjoyment which a king might envy. The spring beauties have come at last to our woods, and that little modest pure white flower that grows by their side (I do not remember its name.

June will tell you all the home news. The first of our cows (Newfield) has just calved. Eddy brings in lots of eggs every day. I don't believe we shall have much of a garden by the house this summer. I am tired of tilling that heavy and ungrateful spot. We have not begun our building yet. I hope to soon. Farmers are very busy now. Spring and summer - the maiden and the matron - have come both together this year. We had a glorious day yesterday - beautiful as a dream of heaven. The sky seemed to clothe itself in smiles and to come near to us; the grass growed visibly - its beautiful green getting every hour more enchanting.

I thought I would mention this, although I do not attach much importance to it. I took one dose (1/2 teaspoonful) of the Ex coca yesterday, and one the day before.

The stone-cutter, who excavated some rock for them, showed me the stone - a specimen- under a prospecting glass, magnifying 40 or fifty diameters he thought. I was much interested in it, and thought how much undiscovered wealth lies around us, if we had eyes to see it. The Earth is our home, and a pretty good one, - the Lord said \"very good;\" but I fear we are very much strangers in it.

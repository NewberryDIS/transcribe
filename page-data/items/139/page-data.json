It has some of the most beautiful imagery I've found anywhere. For instance, the speech of the young Syrian, when he says of Salomí: \"Elle ressemble au reflet d'une rose blanche dans un miroir d'argent.\" Isn't that exquisite? And then the wonderfully tragic last speech of Salomí, after she has kissed the dead lips of the prophet: \"Ah! j'ai baisè ta bouche, Iokoanan, j'ai baisè ta bouche.

Youth, The Heart of Darkness, and At the End of the Tether, (all in the volume you gave me), besides being compelling stories, are full of the most gorgeous descriptive writing I've ever read- particularly The Heart of Darkness, altho the others are also full of scenes you'll never forget.

William Beebe writes scientifically ^accurate description that is also wonderfully beautiful. You will find a great deal of his stuff in the bound volumes of the \"Atlantic Monthly\" (some of it's in book form, too.) Hudson is very very good, but you already know that.\nI was surprised at your remark about teaching or preaching- from something Helen said, I thot you had determined upon New York","9fdf7596aec3678dcce60f514fa5c890.jpg"],[32734,"as soon as you get your degrees.

Since the recent merger, a number of changes have been made, one of which has affected my activities considerably. Since we started our publication six years ago, the tractor industry has undergone a number of changes, changes which for the most part have been occasioned by agricultural depression. The production of the old manufacturers has been decreasing for four years, while the production of the Ford Motor Co. has increased until it is about 80 per cent of the total. The old manufacturers have resented Ford's invasion of the tractor field, which made it impossible to cover the entire field. The old manufacturers would not support a publication devoted to the industry unless we kept the Ford out of it, and in view of the fact that Ford is producing such a majority of all tractors, and is increasing his production about 50 per cent every year, we finally decided to make it a Fordson publication.\nNaturally a change so radical has made it necessary to do a lot of hard work. The Ford Motor Co. is making its tractor quite a factor in industries other than agriculture, and since this change was made, I have had to dig up a lot of industrial articles on the use of the Fordson. Since the first of March for instance, I have watched tractors pull submarine cables from the bottom of the Delaware River; pulls cables through underground conduits; raise material in constructing buildings; load White Star lines in New York City; do excavating work in Brooklyn; build and maintain roads in Virginia; do logging work in the Dismal Swap in North Carolina; haul materials in the Studebaker factory in South Bend; hauling lumber in Chicago, and several other things. In the next few weeks I expect to be in Bradford, Pa., Louisville, Ky. and Greensboro, N.C. In addition I get to New York about twice a month at least. It means about two weeks traveling every month, and two weeks work in the office.\nThree weeks ago tomorrow I left for Detroit by way of New York, having a short visit with Margaret while in New York. I spent three days in Detroit, the next three in Chicago, Sunday in Waukegan with some friends, driving to Zion City 6 miles away in the afternoon, and hearing Voliva and his choir of 500 voices; Monday in Joliet and Ottawa, Ill.; Tuesday in Michigan City and South Bend; Wednesday in Cleveland, Youngstown and Akron, and Thursday in Canton and North Canton, getting home Friday morning. Traveling is strenuous work, but I don't seem able to get below 180 lb.","cfc57688d7cc974aefa4b656670663c4.jpg"],[32789,"CHILTON COMPANY\nC.A. MUSSELMAN, Pres. & Gen'l Mgr. A.H. VAUX, Sec'y & Asst.

Margaret also was here visiting with Dorothy and Junior a couple of days while I was gone, and Junior had to celebrate his eighth birthday without paternal assistance. He got theorugh the ordeal, all right however. He has been meaning to write you and thank you for the coin you sent him, which we found to be a British penny of 1806 with George III on it. The oldest modern coin he has is a Spanish one made in 1712, but he also has acquired a couple of old Roman ones, one of which has an image of Constantine, which would make it about 300 A.D., and the other which he is unable to identify as to any particular period or reign. Outside of being a bug on stamps and coins, his main activity is music and he is now playing such pieces as Schubert's Serenade and Mendelssohn's Spring Song.\nWhile in Chicago I saw Everett, who looks more like a boy than Junior, because he dresses more like one and has his hair closely shingled. He is somewhat stockier than Junior and I thoughtperhaps somewhat taller, as he came to my top vest button, but Junior goes about an inch above the same button on the same suit. Everett knows a lot about history and seems greatly interested in it. Rachel was asleep.\nI am inclosing a little booklet which I received a few days ago and which I am sending for Edward's benefit. I think it expresses the thought that Bob and I both have regarding what he should do, that there is a greater demand for brains and ideas in the business world than in the professions. Through my experiences with the Chilton Company and contact with manufacturing institutions I am led to believe that the field of merchandising presents greater opportunities than any other. It is now on a higher plane than ever before and involves the human element more than any profession almost. Business nowadays contemplates the habits of the human race, their psychology, analaysis of buying habits, how to reach the people even though it may involve changing their habits, advertising and a lot of things which must precede selling campaigns and keep buyers satisfied after sales are made. The business world is full of romance. Five years ago everybody was satisfied with a wooden pencil with a piece of graphite in the center. Now the Eversharp business runs into millions every year. Back of this was business brains which made an Eversharp a necessity instead of a luxury. The talking machine people doubtless would be willing to pay a million dollars to some one who could devise some idea which would enable them to maintain their former volume of business in the face of radio competition. A friend of mine in Kansas City, who is an advertising man, was recently given $25,000 worth of stock in a company manufacturing a product for Ford cars and trucks, because he was able to devise a plan for advertising it and enabling dealers to sell it. I believe that Edward with his banking business as a background could fit admirably into some business organization. He might have to start in what might seem to","626ced419a14e268733dc53a2bb2e36b.jpg"],[32790,"CHILTON COMPANY\nC.A. MUSSELMAN, Pres. & Gen'l Mgr. A.H. VAUX, Sec'y & Asst. Treas.\nA.B.

But there are so many thing sin the business world. Motor buses are competing with railroads and electric lines for passenger business, and motor trucks are cutting into freight business of the railroads. Motor lines are seeking ways to increase business and railroads are trying to counteract them. Even the millers in Minneapolis would like to find some way to market 200,000,000 more bushels of wheat made into flour, or other products. Farmers are trying to find ways of marketing their products as did the fruit growers of California, who are now selling nearly ten times as many oranges as they did ten years ago. There are big oppotunities in almost every business. Their commodities may differ but their problems are much thesame. Sales managers are making thousands where college professors and presidents are making hundreds. There is more opportunity to grow in business and business offers just as many opportunities to serve humanity as most professions.\nWell, I must close now as it is lunch time and I have a lot of things to do this afternoon. We are all well and trust that you are the same. I had a little visit with Douglas over the telephone in Detroit. He is now running a grocery store on the outskirts of the city.

Roseberry of the Oliver Chilled Plow Works. You will find Walter a very affable and congenial person, willing to assist you if he possibly can, although perhaps you may obtain the impression that he is somewhat proud of himself. If he does seem a little overbearing, and I don't think it will be very noticeable, just remember that he has pretty good reason to be. His success has been due largely to his own efforts.

The storm here was not unusually severe except that it came so early. It started with lightening and thunder with gusts of wind and rain but it soon settled into a steady downpour of rain which during the night turned to a damp snow or sleet which continued all the next day and part of the next night. all the time the wind was blowing a stiff gale which made it very hard for cattle that were not sheltered Most of the cattle owned in this vicinity (except milk cows) were away on pasture","d00654715873b922995252a1e972feb9.jpg"],[32810,"(2)\nand a number died. Not nearly everyone lost any but occasionally we hear of someone losing one or two and in some instances eight or ten Peter Reynolds did not lose any John Jenkins lost one and so it was. What cattle we did have were sheltered and did not suffer. We have had almost as bad a storm since. I have meant a hundred times to write to you in regard to Uncle John's sickness but I can perhaps tell you no more than John Eddie has already told you. He had not been strong for quite a while I happened to go over to see him the morning he was taken worse. The hired men said that he had a spell of vomiting in the morning and then went to bed. When I got there he had a very high fever was drowsy and his mind somewhat confused. I sent at once for the doctor. I asked him what doctor he wanted and he said Hays","400e3357d9f7838a05aa74b6e28c1175.jpg"],[32811,"(3)\nThe Dr. considered his condition serious. so we sent for John Eddie, I stayed with him that night. and I had the first ague chill that I ever had. Mr Horace Barnard and I stayed with him the next night and the next day. If I remember rightly J.E. came that day I was there that day when J.E. came but I was feeling quite sick with chills by this time and I came home and did not feel able to go back there any more. I did not attend the funeral I was feeling so badly. He had as good care as I and some of the kind neighbors could give him. untill John E. came, I was with him nearly all the time after I found he was sick and needed my help untill J.E. came. I believe this ailiment was maleria fever or something of that nature accompanied with old age and general debility. I believe that if he had","76645368d56b60597b7e36d9c331f461.jpg"],[32812,"(4)\ngive up his form entirely and taken absolute rest he might perhaps be living now. I advised him to let J.E. have entire charge and let him have what he could make after Uncle John got his living, (the summer J.E. was here) but he said that he could not give up but wanted to \"die in the harness\". so he was doubtless as happy as though someone had persisted in his giving up, that last summer he was so much at the mercy of his hired help and he would go to town by himself with a team and he had a number of narrow escapes from acidents that several of the neighbors suggested to me that he ought to have a guardian appointed but I believe that if John Eddie had taken such action that he would have much more to regret than he has as it is. After his house burned I tried to dissuade him from going back to his old manner of living and make his home with John Eddie. to strengthen my argument I said why","f9b1744e1351cd35347f523a8e392088.jpg"],[32813,"(5)\nUncle John if you go back you will lose money every day you live. He replied Robert it is mine and if I chose to lose it no one ought to object, I never said anything to him about it afterward. It seemed to me that his argument was good. If that was the way he could best enjoy himself in his declining years. that settled it. As we grow older we are apt to become more fired in our ways but that is no reason why our wishes should not be considered. I believe Uncle John had thoroughly considered what was best and that was his decission. We are all quite well.

He was brought over here to our house with nothing on but his overhauls and shirt barefooted and bareheaded Every rag of his clothing and that of the hired boys was burned.

She wrote to Ottie in the fore part of Mary's shortly after Mary went to keeping house, and has not heard from her since.\nLizzie says she has not been sick a-bed, not dangerous either she guesses, but has had a hard cough. She was first taken with sick-headache and chills, but her flesh seemed very hot, though she was so chilly. She had quite a high fever one night,","701aeccc3edc925f385c7d2abf1b0113.jpg"],[32869,"and after that her cough (which had been troubling her slightly for some time) grew worse.

I have often regretted our neglect of you and our apparent coldness, since you visited us.

Your letter to Mother, which you were so kind as to send us soon after you were here, was certainly very welcome and Mother would doubtless have answered it herself if it were not for a pressure of cares. She does not often write letters, but she wanted very much to have some of us children write to you. and we were so naughty as not to do it.\nWe are like orphans almost, here now.

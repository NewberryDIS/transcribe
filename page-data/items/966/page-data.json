H. Drayton Esq.\nOne of the Beloved Men\nof \nSouth Carolina\nTo the Beloved Men, Head Men & Warriors\nof\nThe Cherokee Nation\nat the Congarees, Sep. 25, 1775\nFriends & Brothers Warriors\nI take you by the hand, in witness of the Peace and friendship\nwhich has so long subsisted between your Brothers the White \nPeople of this Country and you and your People; and I hold your\nhand fast in testimony that your Brothers the White People\nwish that our Peace & Friendship with you and your People may\ncontinue.\nI sent a talk to you in your Nation to desire that you would come \nto see me at the Congarees in order that we might talk together\nface to face. When I sent to you, I thought to have been here, \nbefore you could have arrived: but some of our People who did not\nunderstand the things about which I intend to speak to you; & to \nexplain which to them I came into the Country, my stay among\nthose People was therefore longer than I expected; & I was thereby\ndetained from seeing you at the time I appointed. This being the case,\nI make no doubt but that you will readily excuse my absence\nwhich I assure you was as disagreeable to myself, as it could\npossibly be to you.\nI sent to you, to come to me that I might explain to you, the\ncauses of the unhappy quarrel between a part of the People in\nGreat Britain & your Brothers the White People living in Ame-\nrica.  ---Also, that I might tell you why our People have put\non their Shot Pouches, & hold their Rifles in their hands.\nThe causes of this unhappy quarrel are very plain, as you will see\nas I go on with my talk; but, in order that you may see them\nand understand them clearly, I must first talk to you of the\ntime before any of our White People came to this Country, and\n\n\nbox Ayer N. A. ms 255","d82e7f9004010b859e9d71db4158bffe.jpg"],[61698,"what was then done.\nBefore our Forefathers left England, they made an agree-\nment with the Great King, that when they came over to\nAmerica, they and their children after them, should there\ncontinue to have and to enjoy the same Rights & Privileges \nthat the People of England who you know were their own\nBrothers did actually enjoy. And to this Agreement, the \nGreat King put his hand & his seal; and declared that all\nthe Great Kings after him should be bound by the Agreement\nhe had made.\nNow, in consequence of this agreement, your Brothers the\nWhite People in America say, the money they have in \ntheir pockets is their own; and the Great King has no right\nwhatsoever to send or to order any officers to take this money\nor any part of it out of our pockets, or to many any laws\nto bind us but by our own consent given by own [strike] our Wise\nMen who we ourselves elect & appoint to make laws for us.\nAnd we say so for this plain and good reason: because the\nGreat King has not right to send any Officers to take any\nmoney out of the Pockets of our Brothers the People of\nEngland, or to bind them by any laws but by their own\nconsent given by their Wise Men, who they themselves elect\n& appoint to make laws for them.  For as this is the right\nand privilege of our Brothers in England, so this agreement\ndeclares we have the same right and privilege.__\nBut notwithstanding these things, the Men about the Great\nKing, have persuaded him, that he and the Men in England\nwhom we never elected and appointed to make laws for\nus, have a right to take our money out of our pockets\nwithout our consent, and to make laws to drag us away\nfrom our own Country across the great water, and all this\nwithout asking us anything about the matter and violently\nagainst our consent and good liking.  And unjust and wicked\nas all this is, yet this is not the worst part of their usage","705740876bedb6c3df0e00e5298aba67.jpg"],[61699,"to us.  They have by other laws broken our agreement in whatever particular part they pleased: and these Men about the Great King have so teazed & persuaded him, that the Great King and the Men in England whom as I told you before, we never appointed to make laws for us, have made one law which says the Great King & those Men have a right to bind us by laws of their making, in all cases whatsoever: which is as much as to say, they have a right to treat us and everything belonging to us, just as they please: and this you know is as much as to say say they have a right to take all our money, all our lands, all our cattle and horses and such things; & not only all such things, but our Wives & Children in order to make servants of them, and besides all these things, to put us in strong houses & put us to death whenever they please.\nFriends and Brother Warriors, it is not now as plain as the sight at the end of your Rifles that these laws and proceedings are like so many hatchets chopping our agreement to peices?   Are not these unjust things enough to make us put on our shot pouches and especially when we find that our Brothers over the Great Water will not only not hearken to the many good Talks which we have sent them about these matters: but have really sent over People to take the hatchet up against us?\nOh my Brother Warriors, it is a lamentable thing, that our Brothers beyond the great water should use is in this cruel manner!___ If they use us, their own fleash and blood in this unjust way, what must you expect: you who are red People: you whom they never saw; you whom they know only the the hearing of the ear; you who have find lands?___ You see by their treatment of us, that agreements even under hand and seal go as nothing with them.___ Think of these things my Friends, and reflect upon them day and night.___\nHaving told you that the Men about the Great King persuaded him, that he and the men in England have a right to take our money out of our pockets without our consent: I must now tell you the contrivances they have fallen upon to take this money whether we will or not.___\n\n                                                                                     2                                                                        MS 255","02ca7e5fc4c5f24b8e3bb99b5d1fbfb5.jpg"],[61700,"In order to take this money from us, they have ordered that we must pay a duty upon this and that thing that we are accustomed to purchase, which is as much as to say, that upon those things which we purchase we must pay to the Great King against our consent a sum of money above the real value of those things.  And in particular they ordered, that if we drink Tea, we must pay so much money to the Great King.___  I must tell you, this Tea is somewhat like your black drink.__ But as we know that this order is contrary to our agreement; and also, as we know the evil consequences of our paying this money so your Brother the White people in america have resolved that they will not pay it; and therefore the Men about the Great King have persuaded him to send Soldiers to Boston, and we are told some are coming here to force the People to give their money without their consent; and thereby to give up their rights and privileges which are mentioned in the agreement.\nSome foolish People say it is better to pay this money for the Tea, than to go to War about it.  But I tell you, it is not about this money alone that we quarrel, for the money itself we do not regard as two corn stalks; but, we are afraid bad consequences will follow if we pay the money, as I will shew to you directly.\nWe find that the Men in England talk among themselves that they intend to make us in america pay to them a great sum of money every year.  The way they intend to raise this money is as I have told you already by making us pay a duty upon this and that thing that we are accustomed to purchase.  Now this duty upon Tea brings in but a very small part of that great sum of money they want to make us pay to them; and therefore, we refuse to pay this money","e813480b48550023d6b82cb5db8a99ba.jpg"],[61701,"for the Tea, least, if we paid it, they would be encouraged to go on time after time, to lay duties upon a great many other things, which we are accustomed to purchase; in order that they may at last get from us, that great Sum of Money which they want, and which perhaps is all we have. [illegible word] which means, as your Brothers the White People will be obliged to give more money than usual, for those blankets, strouds, checks, linens, guns, power, paint & Rum with which you are supplied; so if money is thus taken out of our pockets without our consent, & against our agreement, it is plain and certain that you and your People, must pay two and three deer skins for those goods, which you used to purchase of the Tracers one deer skin.  And thus you see, my Friends and Brother Warriors [5 words strike], that we do not quarrel only upon our own account; but that we have put on our shot pouches, not only to save [strike] preserve our money, but also to preserve your deer skins.\nFriends and Brother Warriors, I have now told you the causes of the [strike] our unhappy quarrel with the Men over the great water.  I hope your Eyes are now opened and that you see plainly, that your interest is as much concerned in this quarrel as our interest, and that you also see, that we have put on our shot pouches and have taken up our rifles, only to defend our rights and privileges according to the agreement, and by doing so, to defend your deer skins against those who wish to rob you of them.\nTherefore, as a [strike] your people and our people were born upon and live in the same land__ as we are old acquaintances, and we [strike] have thereby contracted a regard for each other__ as our interest in this quarrel is the same, for the Men over the great water cannot take our money without [strike] against our consent without taking your deer skins also__ as you see that no agreement is kept with us, so you cannot expect to be better treated by Men who want all that you and ourselves have.  I say, as\n\n                                                                                    3                                                                    * box Ayer   MS 255","1fa828a8949c5fb041bd1307220e2779.jpg"],[61702,"all these thing show you that if we are hurt, you must be hurt also,___ if we lose, you must lose also___ if we fall, you must fall also:  so I tell you in time, that you and ourselves ought to join together, in order to prevent any [strike 2 words] to save all of us from being hurt, or from losing, or from falling.___ Let us therefore exert ourselves, you at your end of the chain of Peace, and we at our end, in order that we may keep this chain bright and shining.___ So shall we act to each other like Brothers__ So shall we be able to support and assist each other against our common enemies__ So shall we be able to stand together in perfect safety against those evil Men, who in the end mean to ruin you, as well as ourselves who are their own fleash and blood.\nI am informed that you have been told, that your Brothers, the White People in Charles Town, used you ill, when they seized on amunition which your Traders intended to have sent to you. It is true my Friends, that we did seize this amunition; and I tell you, that your Brothers the White People seized it with great concern, because they knew their seizing it would in some degree distress you: but I tell you also, the Men about the Great King, are the only Persons to be blamed in this affair.  For as we found, that these Men persuaded the Great King to send Soldiers against us, & to stop all kinds of amunition from coming to us as usual in order that we should not be able to defend ourselves, so these men about the Great King by this proceeding compelled us to seize such amunition for our own defence, as came among us by accident; and accordingly we greedily seized the amunition that was intended for your hunting, or order to have in our hands the means of defending our lives, our money and your deerskins, as I told you before, against our oppressors.  And this behavior of ours was so natural and just, that we knew, that when we came to talk to you on the matter, you would think","005566b97fc0dc4768ad46ca97965a29.jpg"],[61703,"8\npower__ I say, as a token of this, I take the Coat off my own back, & I give it to you.__ For my part, in this unhappy time, I will be content to wear, an Osnaburg Split Shirt.\n\n I hear that one of your People has lately been, killed, and that two others were at the same time wounded by some of the white People on the ceded lands in Georgia.___ I feel great grief at the news.___ Mr. Wilkinson is just come from Seneka, and has brought me a talk from the Warriors & Headmen who were nine days ago assembled at that Town in Council upon the occasion of this bad news.__ In this talk the Warrior Tawney, and the Major Warrior, says he remember, that in the last treaty of Peace it was agreed, that if a white man should be killed by their People, the Perpetrators of the Murder should be put to death, and that the same satisfaction should be given by the White People in case in case [2 words strike] one of your people should be murdered by ours.  Tawney also says, that the Warriors & Beloved men will wait to see if this will be complied with or not, & in the mean time they will not think of resentment, or of saying any thing to lessen our friendship.  The Warrior Chenesto, also gave [strike] sends a good talk & says he does not desire to break the line of friendship which the beloved men who are dead & gone drew between us.___ Those talks sound well in my ears; and in return to these good talks, I tell you, that this matter shall with all possible speed be fully enquired into, and if the White people have done wrong, and without provocation have killed your Countryman, you may be assured that those White People who were concerned in such a wicked & black affair shall be punished and thereby your People will have satisfaction according to the Treaty.___ I desire you will tell the Relations of the Poor Man who has been killed, how much I am concerned at their loss.  I am told he has left a widow & children: I give these presents, to them; [2 words strike] and I desire you will carry them to the unfortunate Widow, in order to show","3e7a90f5d5c129a71883714802693c81.jpg"],[61704,"7\nwe did nothing but what was just, and what you would have done had you been in our situation.____ However, the amunition that was seized, was intended to be sold to you: but, to show you that we regard you as Brothers, we intend to make you a present of some.  We wish we were able to give you, as much as your occasions require: but as the Great King has so ordered it, that we cannot get much for ourselves:  &, as we expect to fight our enemies, therefore we cannot afford to give you much of what we have. ___  I know your good sense will inform that this is perfectly reasonable; and that we ought not to give away so much amunition, as would leave us, & you also, exposed to enemies, who, as I told you before, cannot hurt us, without hurting you also.\n\n    It is a concern to us when we reflect, that the present quarrel occasions a scarcity of goods in your Nation.  But goods are scarce with us also; and we submit to this inconvenience chearfully, rather than purchase those goods, which if we did purchase, would strengthen the hands of our oppressors against us.  We hope our example will encourage you to suffer this scarcity as patiently as we do.  When the Public Peace shall be restored, by our rights & privileges being restored to us; and when we can purchase goods without any risque of paying for them more than they are worth, by paying duties upon them contrary to our consent, contrary to our agreement, & contrary to our, & to your interest; then will you and your children after you be plentifully supplied again as usual.

I strikethrough took my discharge and /strikethrough departed for Taos ^[where I] arrived in August 1828.\nSome time before my arrival Mr. Ewing Young had sent a party of trappers to the Colorado of the West. ^[They were defeated] in a fight with the Indians strikethrough were defeated /strikethrough Having fought all of one day and gaining no advantage they considered it pruedent sic to Return.

Game was","5d367566c34e2885804f4eb7e16349a9.jpg"],[67382,"very scarce after strikethrough remaining /strikethrough ^[passing]. Three days continually on the hunt to procure strikethrough the necessaried /strikethrough ^[food for the expedition. We found] we had only killed three deer, the skins of which we strikethrough made into /strikethrough took off in such a manner as to make strikethrough water /strikethrough tanks for the purpose of carrying water. We then started on our expedition in the best of spirits, having heard from the Indians that the streams of the Valley to which we were going were full of Beaver. But ^[that] the strikethrough country /strikethrough over which we were ^[first] to travel was verry sic barren and that we would suffer very much, for want of water. The truth of which ^[statement] we ^[were] very soon ^[to] know. The first four days march was over a country, sandy, burned up and ^[utterly dry] strikethrough not a drop of water /strikethrough. strikethrough We [?] /strikethrough ^[Each night we] received a small quantity of water from the tank which we had been strikethrough fortunate to have/strikethrough ^[wise enough to bring them] along. A guard was then placed over strikethrough the tank /strikethrough to prohibit any one from making use of more than his own? allowance ^[of this precious fluid]. After four days travel we ^[fortunately] found ^[more] water before we reached strikethrough the water /strikethrough ^[it] the pack mules were strung along the road for several miles. They strikethrough having /strikethrough smelt strikethrough the water /strikethrough ^[it] long before we had any hopes of finding strikethrough any /strikethrough ^[it] and strikethrough than each arrival /strikethrough made the best of use of the ^[little] strength ^[that was] left.

We remained ^[near the river for] two days, it would have been impracticable to strikethrough to /strikethrough the men and animals ^[the] rest which they so much required.\nAfter strikethrough remaining /strikethrough two days strikethrough encamped /strikethrough ^[of repose] we started on our expedition and strikethrough for four days /strikethrough travelled","f01837c6584871316bcf43f838862ba8.jpg"],[67383,"over country similar to that which we strikethrough travelled /strikethrough ^[had traversed] before our arrival ^[at] strikethrough to /strikethrough the ? water. strikethrough Then was not any /strikethrough ^[no] water ^[was] to be found during ^[all] this time and we suffered extremely on account of it. On the fourth day we arrived on the Colorado of the West- below the great canon. strikethrough It /strikethrough ^[Our joy] can be better imagined strikethrough our joy /strikethrough than described when we discovered the ^[great] ?. We had ^[also] suffered greatly for want of food, we met a party of the Mohavi sic Indians and purchased of them a man heavy with strikethrough food /strikethrough ^[?], the strikethrough arrival /strikethrough ^{man] was killed, and eaten by the party with great gusto even to the foal? was devoured. ^[Then] we strikethrough encamped /strikethrough ^[encamped] on the banks of the Colorado three days recruiting our animals and trading for provisions with the Indians ^[from whom] we procured strikethrough of them /strikethrough a few beans &  ^[some] corn. We took a South Western course & in ^[a] three days march strikethrough we /strikethrough struck the ^[dried up] bed of a stream which was on the coast range ?] a Southeast ^[on] course and is last in the Sands of the great basin. We proceeded up the ^[bed of the] stream for six days strikethrough no /strikethrough ^[and] two days after our arrival on strikethrough the stream we /strikethrough ^[it we again] found water.

At the mission strikethrough there was /strikethrough ^[we found] one priest, fifteen soldiers and about one thousand Indians. They had about 80,000 head of stock, ? and barnyards, in ? strikethroughof were /strikethrough ^[lived in a] paradise on earth. We remained one day at the mission, received good treatment strikethrough of /strikethrough ^[from] the inhabitants and purchased strikethrough of them /strikethrough what beef we required. We had nothing but butcher knives to trade and for four They ^[of these knives they] would give ^[us] a beef","9f91ec29a14193ff3e73ddf0bccb09e7.jpg"],[67384,"strikethrough We received information from the missionaries of the mission of San Fernando we travelled for the mission found the pass through the mountains. /strikethrough\nIn our day's travel from this mission we reached the mission of San Fernando, having [?] the same number of inhabitants but not carried on ^[on] as large a scale as the one of San Gabriel.","ef6bbe7ca0f401f47991324ab0d4756a.jpg"],[67385,"the runaways were concealed ^[and] demanded strikethrough them to /strikethrough ^[that they] be given up. strikethrough Which /strikethrough ^[This demand] was refused ^[whereupon] they ^[then] attacked the strikethrough village and /strikethrough ^[camp but] after a severe struggle, strikethrough They /strikethrough were compelled to retreat. They ^[then] came to us & requested strikethrough assistance /strikethrough ^[our help]. Mr. Young directed me & eleven men to join ^[them] we returned strikethrough to the village /strikethrough & made an attack ^[&] fought for one entire day, the Indians were routed ^[&] lost a great number of men. We entered their village in triumph, set fire to it and burned it to the ground. The next day we demanded the runaways and informed strikethrough them /strikethrough ^[the hostile Indians] that if ^[they were] not immediately given up, we would not leave of them alive. They complied with our demands. We turned over strikethrough the Indians /strikethrough ^[our prisoners] to those from whom they had deserted & strikethrough we /strikethrough returned to our ^[own] camp. Mr. Young & four of us proceeded strikethrough with the Indians /strikethrough to San Rafael, strikethrough we /strikethrough took with us the Beaver we had on hand, we were well received by the missionaries. At the mission we found a trading schooner, the Captain of which was ashore. We traded [^our furs] with  him strikethrough our /strikethrough","ea7d8b742a4b6781cd7bd26a60dc3e7f.jpg"],[67386,"5\nstrikethrough horses /strikethrough animals with the exception of six that were eaten strikethrough and returned to our camp /strikethrough\nunintelligible On the first strikethrough camp /strikethrough of Sept. we struck camp, and, returning by ^[the] same ? ^[by] which we had come, strikethrough passing /strikethrough passed through San Fernando, strikethrough we we- /strikethrough ^[and] travelled to the Pueblo of Los Angeles, where the Mexican authorities demand our passports, we had none. They wished to arrest us but fear deterred them. They then commenced selling liquor to the men, no doubt for the purpose of getting strikethrough the men /strikethrough ^[them] drunk, so that they would have but little difficulty in making strikethrough the /strikethrough ^[an] arrest. Mr. Young discovered there sic intentions, directed me to take three men, all the [loose?] animals, pack and to go in advance. He would remain with the balance of the party and endeavor to get them along. If he did not arrive at my camp by ^[the] next morning. I was strikethrough directed /strikethrough told to move on as best I could, and on my return to report the party ^[as] killed, for Young would not have them. They were followed by the Mexicans ^[who] furnished them all the liquor they could pay for, ^[They] all got drunk excepting Youn. The Mexicans would have continued with them till they arrived at the Mission of San Gabriel then being reinforced","7e79aea70db253372f0e17360629c380.jpg"],[67387,"About dark Young and ^[his] party found me. The next day we departed and pursued nearly the same route by which we came and in nine days strikethrough we arrived on /strikethrough ^[reached the banks of] the Colorado. Two days after our arrival strikethrough on the Colorado /strikethrough at least five hundred Indian warriors came to our camp. They pretended friendship, but strikethrough a such large numbers coming /strikethrough ^[as they had come in such numbers] we mistrusted them and closely watched their maneuvers, we discovered when they had their weapons concealed and then it became apparent to us that their design was to murder the party. There were but few of us in camp, the greater number being out visiting their traps. I considered the safest way to act was not to let the Indians know of our strikethrough mistrust /strikethrough ^[suspicions] and to strikethrough act in /strikethrough ^[assume] a [fearless?] manner. One of the Indians could speak Spanish I directed him to state to the strikethrough Indians /strikethrough ^[rest] that they must leave our camp inside of ten minutes. If one should be found after the expiration of that time he would be shot. Before strikethrough the expiration of /strikethrough the ten minutes ^[were up] every one had left. We trapped down the South Side of ^[the} Colorado River to tide water without any further molestation, and up the North Side to the mouth of the Gila, then up the Gila to rear the mouth of ^[the] Sand Pedro. Near the mouth of the San Pedro, we saw a large herd of animals, horses etc we knew there were Indians near, and not having forgot^[ten] the damages those Same Indians ^[had] done ^[us} we concluded to deprive them of their Stock. We strikethrough damaged /strikethrough ^[attacked] their camp, They fled and we took possession of the^[ir] animals. We same evening we heard a noise, something like the Sound of distant thunder, we sprung for our arms, and sallied out to reconoiter [sic]. ^[We] discovered a party of Indians driving","3779544126ae5bb8cfb868c4ce0f890d.jpg"],[67388,"some two hundred horses, we charged them, firing a few shots the Indians ran, leaving us sole possessors of the horses. Those horses had been stolen by the Indians from Mexicans in Sonora. Having now more animals than we could take care of, we concluded to dispose of them to ^[the] best advantage, we strikethrough chose /strikethrough ^[picked] out as many as we required for riding & [packing?] purposes, Killed ten, dried the meat strikethrough [out?] /strikethrough and strikethrough left /strikethrough ^[turned] the balance loose, I presume the Indians got them. We continued up the Gila to opposite the Copper Mines. We went to the mines, found Robert McNight strikethroughthen /strikethrough ^[and] left our beaver with him, we could not bring it to the settlements to dispose of strikethrough on account of not having /strikethrough ^[because we did not have a] licinse [sic] to trap in strikethrough Spanish /strikethrough ^[Mexican] Territory. We concealed our strikethrough beaver /strikethrough ^[skins] in one of the deep holes dug by the miners. Young & I remained a few days at the mines, the balance of the party had Started for Texas. strikethrough Young & I /strikethrough ^[We then] went to Santa Fe ^[where] he ^[Young] procured a licinse [sic] to trade with ^[the] Indians on the Gila. He sent a few men to the mines strikethrough and brought /strikethrough ^[to get the] beaver he had concealed ^[then]. They got it and returned to Santa Fe. Every one considered he made a fine trade in strikethrough so /strikethrough ^[a] short a [period?], they were not aware that we had been ^[trapping for] months strikethrough trappings [[/strikethrough], the strikethrough Beaver was /strikethrough ^[skins were] disposed of the advantage of Santa Fe, some two thousand pounds in all. In April 1830 we had all safely arrived at Taos, the [amount] us was paid, each of us having Several hundred dollars. We passed the time gloriously spending our money freely, never thinking that our lives were risked in gaming it. Our only desire was to get rid of the drop as soon as possible, but at the same time have as much","e4ec9d2b500c6b2f8e57879cb5b51328.jpg"],[67389,"pleasure and enjoyment as the county would afford. Trappers and Sailors are similar in regard to the money that they earn so dearly strikethrough daily /strikethrough bing ^[daily] in danger of loosing [sic] their strikethrough life /strikethrough ^[lives]. But when the voyage has been made ^[and they have received] their pay they ^[do not] think strikethrough not  /strikethrough of the hardships and dangers through which they have passed ^[they] Spend all they have and are ready for another trip. In all probability ^[they] have to be furnished with all that is necessary for their outfit. \nIn the face of 1830 I found the party under Fitzpatrick ^[bound] for the Rocky Mountains on a trapping expedition. We trapped to the head of the Sweetwater strikethrough and /strikethrough there on to Green River and then to Jackson's hole a strikethrough branch /strikethrough ^[fork] of the Columbia river and from there on to the head of ^[the] Salmon River then we came to the camp of a part of our band that we had been hunting ^[for] then we went into winter quarters on the head of ^[the] Salmon River. During ^[the] winter we lost some four or five men strikethrough when /strikethrough ^[who were] out hunting ^[for] buffalo they were Killed by the Blackfoot Indians. In April of 1831 we commenced in our hunt again. We trapped back on to Bear River the principal Stream that empties into the Great Salt Lake, strikethrough there /strikethrough ^[and travelled] on to Green River, we strikethrough then /strikethrough found a party of trapper ^[there] under charge of Mr. Sinclair. They ^[had] left Taos, shortly after we had, strikethrough they /strikethrough and had wintered on the little Bear River a branch of ^[the] Green. They told me that [Capt.

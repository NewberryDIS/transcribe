What motive \nEdwin could have in communicating to you such erroneous \nideas as you say he did I know not and I am author \n-ized by Erasmus to give them an unqualified contradiction \nhe made this proposition to Edwin to take you with \nyour Family Edwin and himself and settle down in \nthe western Country. He thought it would be a home \nfor you in your old age. But Edwin declined and this \nSpring he got married and again renewed the the proposition \nhis knowing that Father was at home But Edwin \nsaid it was altogether out of reason in taking you out \nwith them. Since then Father has returned home \nand as you say a reformed man and it is my heart's \ndesire and prayer to God that he may continue so \nyou say if your children think it their duty to despise\nand neglect their mother because she thinks it \nher duty to live with their Father if he would become \na reformed man God will grant your grace to be \nreconciled to it you hope: Mother harbour not such \nthoughts.

There were \n4 who spoke to her last week about taking lessons \nin music & we expect them in next week. For \na while her prospects looked rather dubious. I really \nhope she will do well for I think she richly \ndeserves success. We need her assistance in school, \nbut as she has fitted herself for a music teacher \nshe would like scholars enough to keep her busy \nin that department, & I think & hope she will get \nthem. We had a letter from Lydia this morning \ndated at Petersham. I was very glad to learn that \nshe was teaching there. I think, mother, we have \nreason to be thankful, that we have all met \nwith as good success as we have. Lydia said \nthat Myron was well and attending school. I am \nvery glad to hear it. I want he should take \nup arithmetic & if he has not got a slate & \narithmetic I want he should get them imme-\ndiately. I shall probably go to Louisville two \nweeks from to day & I will then get some eastern \nmoney & we will send it to you to meet \nthese expenses & c. Lydia said that Jesse's thumb \ntroubled him so that he was obliged to be at \nhome. I am sorry that it is so. Give him \nour love & tell him to be as careful as possible \nwith his thumb & do the best he can. David \nI suppose is well. We had a letter from Raymond \na few days since; he said he wrote a long letter","b7228ed1af92faf4a181331d282a9dc0.jpg"],[40944,"to us home & Abby enclosed a letter in it to \nSarah & he wondered why we did not write. \nHe said he received a letter from you a short \ntime before he wrote to us. He probably has \nwritten to you & told you all about his affairs. \nI am sorry we did not get his letter for they \nare a going to keeping house & Abby has a good \nmany things at home which he wanted us to \nget, & his letter also contained a proposition in \nregard to Jesse & Myron that I would have been \nglad to have known when I was at home. \nI have not written to Edwin yet for I have been \nso busy. Give our love to Mr. Miller's folks & tell \nthem that Sarah will write soon. Lydia writes \nthat it is very sickly in the east, the prevailing\ndisease being the dysentery. That disease prevails \nin this section of the country but Mount - \nWashington has thus far escaped it. I think now \nthat I shall not regret returning for I think \nmy health will be better here than it would \nbe in N. England & I am in hopes that I shall \nperfectly regain it this Autumn. Give our \nlove to Sister Lydia & our brothers & receive our \nlove & our best wishes for your health & happiness \nRemember us to all our friends.

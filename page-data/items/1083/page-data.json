Auntie read the Commandments to them - Told them it was the Law - and the next Sab. she would tell them the Gospel. - They gave good attention.

He found the room in nice order.\nWent to Newtowns - Had a very interesting meeting. Webster Sylvester there. - Webster preached - and among other things spoke of their being too proud to accept Christ - or pray. - After he finished John Logan - sprang to his feet - and owned that such had been his case - \"now\" said he I will try and pray before you all. The Embarrassment was so great for the poor man - that when he knelt - he seemed to fall down in a heap upon the floor! - His prayer was very touching.

I held Ruhania while Auntie went in - She has a very interesting conversation with the old lady: She now ranks herself among the Pagans. At one time she thought she trusted in Christ and offered herself to the Methodist church - they refused to admit her. - She thinks it was a great injury to her.\nQuery - If her love had been genuine for Jesus - would she have returned to Paganism?\nCalled at Thomas Jones.\nCalled at John Deer's - He is my Indian cousin. Found there was a poor little deformed child with a very wistful face. Poor little suffered and no comforts. - Resolved to make her a double dress.\nMay 19\nVisited the neighborhood over the creek - where Brother Daniel ? is living and doing good.

He was alone - in his faith. One Sabbath he could not come to church on account of the storm. He took his bible and seneca [crossed out] Seneca Testament and Hymn book - and went into the woods to pray and meditate. He said it was one of the most precious seasons of his life. He prayed for that Pagan neighborhood. - Two years after he fell from the roof of the new ? House. - and soon after he died.\nIn the enng of this day - we attended a meeting in that very neighborhood - and I wondered was John conscious of the change? - One after another arose in this meeting - saying that they would like to repent of their sins - A rich filed there - but the \"? are few!\"\nMay 20\nAttended Mission Church this forenoon - had a pleasant time with my Bible class of young men.\nAuntie and I went to the Plank Road at 3 o c in the aft. to hold our first S.S.","5c264c31654b306e622320a8500e47b7.jpg"],[73297,"Found John Armstrong basking in the sun outside the door, upon the grass.  His old Uncle Porcupine reposed upon a blanket in one corner of the room, looking supremely indifferent to us - and all Missionaries in general.  Poor old Man!  80 years old, and no hope in Christ!   A  mind as dark as Midnight, \"Lord, increase our faith!\"\n\"Well, John where are the seats your promised to make?\"\n\"Oh,\" said he - \"nobody coming. - all gone off to a Pagan dance at Pine woods.

Mone failte!  \"Very well\".  said I - \"Sam will get tired of taking away the people every Sunday.\"\n\nAfter awhile we look up the road and saw some children coming.  Who were soon followed by parents - Soon we had a little Congregation of 20! - We prayed, talked & sang, besides teaching them these verses-\n1.   God is love.     2.   Fear God.      3.   Thou god seesh me.        4.   Love your enemies.      5.   Create in me a clean heart O God, and renew","27f6e3f6b96d2ba2be5197f9b808038d.jpg"],[73298,"a right spirit within me.

Webster Pierce preached, and the people listened well.\n\nMay 21st.\nAuntie & I - visited at Newtown. - Called on the sick - found Asher Young very feeble - running down with consumption.  Auntie stayed with Sylvia all night.  I went after her in the morning.   I think my Mass. friends would have been somewhat surprised to have seen me start from the Mission home with old Ruhania - & the rickety buggy.\nAn old hen tied under the sear, for Asher Young.  She made vigorous efforts to extricate herself, most of the way, but was rather unsuccessful!   In front, a basket with the old cat & kittens, for Sylvia, a piece of old carpeting on the basket, with holed cut, to ventilate.","fe8327877cfc65a32a0c2c198ddd72e4.jpg"],[73299,"unclear frequently pull? her nose through to breathe and reap? up considerable weathering? mist of the time.

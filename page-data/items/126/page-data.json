In looking over this first sentence, I find I did not say another what, but you, who wrote it, can easily guess. You cannot tell how much pleasure I derive from these kind messengers from your sisterly hand. My letters, I feel will not repay you for all yours because you are not in a place to appreciate them. At home, in the midst of loved ones, is no place to know the full value of letters. Did I not put full confidence in your love, I should fear you would tire of writing so often. This time I suppose our letters had scarcely time to greet each other as they passed each on its journey of love. They were written the same day; wonder if you are not writing!","11eecb0d1617a9ab026bfcfff7d28d9b.jpg"],[30255,"I was indeed glad to hear that Sarah was able to write a letter, but I could not help wishing I was the happy one destined to receive it. I know it was a selfish wish. Do I wrong in mentioning it? This has been quite a busy day with me. I am very much pleased with my assistant, Miss Dolittle, and my school duties are much less than they were. Perhaps you would like to know how my time is occupied. _So far I had written when I was called upon to pause. I received a call from the mother of one of my pupils. The rain is over now and people are making good use of this fine weather in calling upon the stranger. All are very kind and soon I shall feel myself no longer a stranger. My school is becoming more and more pleasant. True, I have some trials, those who are committed to my care will sometimes be a little [ufractory?] and it requires some firmness on my part to govern then. But these are only exceptions to the general rule, they only serve to [render?] me watchful.

(I spelled it so because there was no room for bosque) While I write, I sit by an open window of my bed=room, and the sky, still tinted by the last rays of the sun, sheds a little light upon my efforts._ Yesterday we attended a lecture at the college. It was by the President; subject, Self Improvement. It was an instructive as well as interesting discourse. A few of our pupils attended. These lectures will occur once in three weeks and I hope we shall be able to attend._ Friday morn. This seems to partake more of the nature of a diary than letter.

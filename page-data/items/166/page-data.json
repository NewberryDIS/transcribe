Kendall and Abby\nWarwick, Jan. 6, 1855.\nA Happy New Year, I wish for thee.  If I may express a wish so free?\nRespected Friends,\nYours, of the 10th last, has been received and if an early return be the only assurance of its kindly reception, I will speedily reply.  Sister Abby and I are having a holiday today, and met at Home.\nThe news we received of the death of Mrs. Kendall called forth for you our deepest sympathy, which we gladly would have expressed, had not we felt your grief was too deep for interuption?.  And since then we have experienced the truth of this.  Our Loved sister unclear, my brother Chandler's wife, was summoned home in August.  And on the morning of the 4th, she cheerfully smiled a Last Farewell and as we hope and  trust, joined the angel band in Heaven.  How happy the thoughts, that the friends we loved so dearly n Earth, are bright angels in Heaven!  Oh!  That I may so live that when Life is done I may join them there.  \nMr. Kendall you sustain a severe loss in the death of your dear wife.  How true it is that \"Life will not prove all sunshine.\"  Did you ever wonder why under the weight of unclear we must on our journey go? I have sometimes, and yet I know it is right and feel that Our Father knows what is best for his children and when he takes the sunshine from us the stars smile from above.","c3d0e8b14d18e4e4fe55496163c7b56e.jpg"],[38837,"Perhaps the pure spirits of departed friends are near us still, affectionately guarding us from the many trials and temptations thro which life may lead. Even that thought affords consolation, and we look forward to the time when we may be called to share the joys of Heaven, and meet the loved ones gone before.\nI need not tell you that your sentiments and ideas of Home are true and purely Christian. Would there were more such homes than there are. The elevated character you give woman, should be the standard of every female. But I regret that too many prize the butterfly joys of Earth more than the purity and excellence of Christian life!\nSo you have given up teaching and the ministry? I am teaching still and have been since I wrote you, all the time with short vacations only. I thought I should rest this winter, but I couldn't! Why is it that teachers never find a time for rest, or rather rest all the time? \nDo you like your present employment as well as you did teaching or the ministry? No doubt it will be better for your health - I think even now, you need to take good care of your health lest you become an invalid again.\nYou spoke of visiting New England. If so I hope you will come to Warwick. Perhaps you will be able to preach One Sabbath. Mr. Wilson does not preach here now - he has not since last April. Mr Jackson of Walpole is our pastor now, and a good faithful one he is. People generally, like him very much indeed. He is very sincere and his sermons cannot fail to make an impression upon the attentive mind. Perhaps you will be interested to know that brother Chandler, brother Tyler and sister Emily are to be received into the church tomorrow - New Year's Sabbath.\nHow could you think of Mt Grace this cold weather? A single glance only, at its snow-crowned summit would give you the ague (I guess) for even I only gaze when the setting sun throws its genial rays across it. And then such clear cold breezes as it sends down to us - you will smile to know your Warwick friends are 22 degrees below zero!\nI hope to hear from you again - A letter from Mr Kendall will always be welcome at Maple Grove. Affectionately, your friend, as ever, Mary A. Reed.","d83ed9169b8d128657cc11fdb583f913.jpg"]],"transcount":2,"percentTranscribed":1,"date":[1851,1871],"category":"Family papers; Letters (Correspondence); Women","title":"Nathan Kendall and Abby J.

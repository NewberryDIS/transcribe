T.\nMay, 10\" 1867\nActg. Asst. Inspector General\nDepart. of the Platte.\nOmaha\nSir\n\n               I desire to call the attention of the Commanding General of the Department to what I consider the deplorable state of some matters in the Quartermasters Department, not only at this Post, but along the whole line from Fort Sedgwick to Fort Phi. Kearney.\n              To go into the history of all the rascalities practised in this country by the employees of the Quartermaster's department would require more time and space than I can devote now to the subject, and I shall only mention, the most glaring irregularities, and those that I think can be remedied in a great degree by the proper attention on the part of the different Quartermasters and the Commanding offices of Posts, and I do not presume to dictate what course should be pursued by other commanding officers than myself.\n                The class of men employed now by the Quartermasters Department is certainly, the worst I ever came in contact with, and the amount of pillaging and open robbery committed by them","ccf70e86950213efe9c8467428368754.jpg"],[69388,"is almost incredible.  A few of the many cases perfectly established, - I will mention to shew to what a desperate state things have arrived:  One man employed here as superintendent of the Mai line deliberately took several hundred dollars worth of provisions - drawn for employees on the line - and sold them to a Ranchman;  another man employed at the Saw Mill ran away with sixteen mules, a wagon master took the corn issued for his train, and sold it to a Ranchman for whiskey; another man employed to Carry the mail deserted his mail, and ran away with the whole of the ambulance team Another man employed in the responsible position of yard Master deliberately stole a saddle from a citizen, and I have every reason to believe that he stole a pistol from another citizen, both of the stolen articles were found in his possession.  Another wagon master stated that two mules were shot by Indians, and died, that a steer was also shot by Indians, when it has been discovered that the mules have disappeared, doubtless stolen, and that the Steer was butchered and eaten by the Quartermaster's men.  Quite a number of these villains have been caught purchasing arms from soldiers &c, &c.  In fact this gang of desperadoes appear to have taken possession as far as","8339b03eff653a59096de8300aa00f08.jpg"],[69389,"possible of the Quartermaster's Department and the Country, and the only way to save the Government from being robbed of an immense amount is to clear the whole country of these employees from Fort C. H. Smith to Omaha.\n\n    It may be reasonably asked why such men are employed?  Why they are not discharged &c  I can only say that I have no idea who employed them.  I found many of them here in the employ of General Dandy when I arrived here, and they were retained by Colonel Camp, and then turned over to the present Post Quartermaster major Grines, who will I feel satisfied to all in his power to rid the service of these bad characters.  He has diminished the number of his employees somewhat, but I think the list might be made much smaller still.\n    It is impossible to punish these characters here, although there is a United States Commissioner here, there is no deputy Marshal to take charge of prisoners and carry them to the Territorial Capital at Yankton, and all he (The Commissioner) can do is to request me to keep them in confinement.   If they are simply discharged from the employ of the Quartermaster here, they turn up as teamsters employed by some other Post by some Quartermaster who hires them without even asking anything of their previous history","e810f220e08f482290de957c299d73b5.jpg"],[69390,"or character.  One man a Wagon master is caught today purchasing arms of a soldier, and I find that he has spent a good portion of his time in the Guard house at Fort Sanders for thieving.  The man who ran away with the sixteen mules, a week or two since was employed by the Quartermaster here without recommendation from any one, and I think he had only been employed a few days when he ran away.  And if I should order the discharge of the whole batch of these creatures, I would be obliged to detail soldiers to do the labor, and there is now a citizen employee borne one the rolls of Quartermasters men at this Post for every Soldier for duty at the Post.  And here I beg to remark that I am never consulted in any way as to who shall be employed, or the number to be employed.  At this Post there are five [underline] clerks employed, besides a storekeeper with an assistant, and Master of transportation, eleven wagon masters, and various other employees in all amounting to nearly three hundred men     There are two little boys employed as messengers in the Quartermaster's Office at $45 per month and a ration, when either of the little fellows ought to be glad (and doubtless would be) to receive $10 per month.  At the Post I formerly commanded when a Regimental [underline] Officer was the Post Quartermaster, there were","1e9d5ed780d0f825ea49b67c8d9476a2.jpg"],[69391,"2\nfour Companies, and it was in important Post.  There were there three Citizens employed at the Post viz: A Blacksmith, a Saddler and a Commissary Clerk, and this number of employees was not allowed to be increased, until after the most earnest representations of the necessity of building quarters, a few mechanics were sent.\nI do not pretend to advise that any Such limit to the number of employees should be made here, but I must say that I think one great reason of such trouble in the Quartermaster's Department is the fact that a Quartermaster who has served perhaps as a Corps Quartermaster during the Was and who had had a vast number of people employed about him, does not feel inclined to haven any less retain [strike] number of retainers around him if he goes to a two company post.  A Regimental [underline] Officer who is appointed Quartermaster of a Post will be allowed (at least that is my opinion [strike] experience), aside from mechanics & teamsters, some two or three men \nSend a regular Quartermaster to the same Post and he carries an army of clerks, Wagon masters, Store Keepers, Masters of transportation, &c, &c, &c &c and more men than the service [strike] troops of the Post can well care for.  The whole system is wrong, and so far as any Post I may command is concerned, I would wish to see it broken up.\n\n  The Quartermaster here informs me that he","fa09af67baa3c0b8c5ed0cce86e03334.jpg"],[69392,"has authority from the Quartermaster General to employ just whom he pleases.  His monthly papers are present to me for my signature as examined. [underline]   As I by no means approve [underline] them Why should I examine them?\n\n    But I desire it understood that I am not in this matter arraigning the present Quartermaster of the Post (Major Grimes).  He came into the Service during the War, was made Quartermaster of a Corps [strike] large Command where it was necessary to have a large number of employees around him, and he cannot come down to the small command of a Post Quartermaster as long as he is permitted to employ whoever he may choose.\n    At this Post there should be, besides a sufficient number of mechanics, [underline] perhaps two clerks, a head Wagon master with an assistant for every fifteen teams, a Store Keeper, a man in charge of the public animals, a herder for every thirty animals, and of Course a teamster for every wagon.  If we run a Saw Mill, we must have the requisite number of men for that, but I suspect if we take the price at which lumber will be furnished from Denver, and multiply it by three we will have about the price of the cost of the lumber from our Saw Mill, when we calculate all the stealing of the men employed at the","1d35c4a6632a2fa37f636d549e91aaad.jpg"],[69393,"mill, the expense of the teams that haul lumber &c.\n\n    There are many other matters connected with the Quartermaster's Department which I cannot but notice, although it may be considered as interfering with what is not my business:\n    A man came here not long since with a team of twelve wagons from the end of the Railroad, he was twenty six [underlined 2 words] days in coming up, and I doubt if he will not be double that time going back.  He stated that he was employed at either $9 or $10 per day for each train and his mules were to be fed by the Quartermaster.  The train was loaded with some Quartermaster stores, that we were in no particular need of.  Colonel Camp who was then the Quartermaster of the Post tole me that he had no orders concerning the man, that he presumed that he could take as long as he choose to come and go I knew nothing or who hired the train, or anything connected with it, I only knew the fact and I think the name of the man in charge of the train was Brown, [underline] and I further believed that if the articles in that train had been dumped into the Platte at the end of the Railroad instead of being hauled here at such enormous","94aeeed2a8428aec5941469144c5680c.jpg"],[69394,"cost to the government, the best interests of the government would have been subserved.\n\n    Another man by the name of McCann of Nebraska City has a contract for delivering a large quantity of corn at Fort Phil Kearney at an enormous price.  He sends the corn as for at this place, refuses for months to go farther, and finally he gets an order to leave it here [underline], after causing the death of $30,000 worth of government stock by his failure to deliver the corn where he contracted to deliver, and where he could have delivered.  I firmly believe if he had chosen to do so.\n\nWith regard to this last affair of his leaving the corn here, I have heard that the Quartermaster (Major Grimes) rather recommended it.  I should have been consulted about that matter myself I think, for I don't think it was necessary to leave the corn here.\n\n    Generally, I would respectfully recommend that as far as this Post is concerned, the Quartermaster be directed to hire no man unless he could furnish evidence of good character, and that he be directed to discharge as soon as possible every man who cannot establish his good character.  He will probably say that this will stop all the labor in the Quarter","0afc0bbd3555863fcb66266363745a86.jpg"],[69395,"-master's Department.  Let it stop.  Get rid of these villains first, and attend to the Indians afterwards.  The Indians are not half as bad as these scoundrels.\n\n    But it would be of no use to attempt to do anything, unless the clearing out could be made a all of the Posts, for all the rascals discharged here would be on us before long as the employees from other Posts.\n    I have written this communication hastily, as I wish to get it away by the mail about to leave the Post.  I wish it to be understood that I do not which to attach blame to any particular officer fro the state of affairs in the Quartermaster's Department.  I believe the statement I make to be true, and I hope something may be done to regulate the matters here spoken of.\n\n                                          I am Sir, Very Respectfully\n                                           Your Obedient Servant\n                                                     M.

I presume the within report is made in obedience to some order requiring chaplains to make periodical reports of the moral condition of the Posts at which they may be serving, and in forwarding it I will merely state that while in the main, the report of the Rev. Mr. Wright may be correct, my natural modesty must prevent my giving decided approval to the remarks which are personal, and so very flattering to myself.\n    However, a \"beau jew, beau retour\", and I will\n\n[middle column]\ntherefore remark that I consider Mr. Wright a very worthy gentleman and, really quite useful.  I have never seen him intoxicated neither has it ever been necessary to reprove him for riotous conduct, and the practice, so freely indulged in by some of the foreign clergy, of keeping a mistress, meets with no favor from him.\n\n    I have never heard Mr. Wright preach, for unfortunately, we have no chapel or suitable place for church services and up to this time the weather has not admitted of outdoor services.  However, I feel sure that he is orthodox and that he can handle a theological subject as clearly as he can his pen or a hoe, - and I must here\n\n[right column]\nremark that he is an excellent gardener.  He is undoubtedly \"ami des noirs\" as he is of the so called  friendly Indian, and if he is not perfectly sound in politics, he will be, I am sure, after we receive the next supply of political Journals from the United States.\n\n  In view of all this it is rather matter of surprise to see that Mr. Wright was overlooked in the recent generous distribution of Brevets to non-compattants, and I do hereby recommend him for a Brevet of Major General to date from March 13th 1865, and to take rank just above the Doctors who were brevetted to the same grade for the same engagement,","91d88adb8372113f4546f68b2d8f25bb.jpg"],[69397,"in which engagement Mr. Wright was one of the oldest and foremost.

Oregon is generally supposed to be a part of the Indian country named in the act of Congress of June 30, 1834 but Such is not the case.  Great Britian and the United States made a treaty in 1818, by which the Northern boundary of the former was extended west on the 49th parallel of North latitude to the Stony Mountains, and the Territory beyond these was described as country to be held in the joint occupation of the two powers.  The Rocky Mountains then was the Western Boundary of the United States for legislative purposes and so continued until 1840.  The act of 1834, shows in terms that it was intended for a country over which the general Government had absolute and exclusive jurisdiction, Congress by express enactments in 1850, extended said act to this Territory for the reason as must be supposed that it was not in force here before that time.  The act of 1834 then, has no vitality here because Oregon is Indian Country, but by virtue of the act of 1850, which gives it effect here so far as its provisions may be applicable, is that provision prohibiting the sale of liquor to the Indian applicable very much of the act of 1834, is [strike] is clearly unsuited to the present condition of the country, all those provisions which tend to prevent emigration, the free occupation","b7231de59d14e86f5070bf9be9f03a9d.jpg"],[69424,"and use of the country by whites, must be considered repealed, whatever militates against the true interest of a white population is inapplicable.  References can be made to no law which in express words or by implication repeals the provisions in question, and no good reason can be assigned why it should not be held applicable to our condition.  If required in a country wholly inhabited by Indians, how much greater the necessity for its enforcement here, where defenceless white persons, women and children, are exposed to the violence of drunken Savages.  Selling liquor to Indians is not necessary to the welfare or prosperity of the people here, on the contrary such a prohibition is a blessing to the Indians, and highly promotive of the safety, peace and good order of the white community.\n\n                             __________________Motion overruled ____________________\n\nSalem: December 7th 1853","fb0b4658cc5afb6e3701c6bda9c94509.jpg"],[69425,"Copy\nOleny Justice_____  I concur with the Cheif Justice that no part of Oregon is Indian Country as defined by the act of 1834, and that none of the provisions of that act were put in force here by the law establishing Territorial Government.  It was a local Statute, and no more extended here by the last clause of Section 14, of our Organic act, than are the local laws of the District of Columbia.  That clause extended over us the general laws of the united States, under which we possessed the right to import and sell to all classes of customers goods of every description, spirits and wines included.  I arrive at the same conclusion with the Cheif Justice that up to June 5, 1850, there were no restrictions or regulations (touching the sale of Spirits or other commodities to Indians) on that day Congress enacted \"That the law regulating trade and intercourse with the Indians [strike s] tribes east of the Rocky Mountains, or such provisions of the same as may be applicable, be extended over the Indian tribes in the Territory of Oregon\" ---- the law refered to is the act of 1834.  By omitting to declare which of its provisions if any, are applicable; Congress has devolved this task upon the Courts, no rule being given by which to determine which are, and which are not applicable, our first and perhaps most difficult duty, is to fix upon Such a rule.  The Cheif Justice thinks this particular provision beneficial to the whites, and therefore applicable.  He make the true interests of","a323884b7a0507f7e84f8a7a0c1e1a31.jpg"],[69426,"the white population, or in other words, his ideas of what is expedient for them the test of applicability.  In this I have not as yet been able to concur.  Congress has declared that this Indian Code in its application to Oregon shall adopt itself to the existing state of things.  If therefore any of its provisions conflict with existing laws, or rights under those laws, the former and not the latter must give way thus making the rights of the whites under existing laws, the test of applicability, and as the right of unrestrained traffic with the Indians is admitted to have existed, the Indian Code must adjust itself to and not destroy that right.\n\n                  Copied from the transcript at Fort Vancouver W.

It is pretty hard to suggest without knowing how you want to use the picture but: -- The finest thing I can suggest would be a miniature on Ivory.  These are very beautiful come in five gold case and cost $125.00 - A 5 x 7 Porcelain in color would be very nice and the picture is very well suited for it.  These cost 45.00. - Should you want a picture to hand on the wall say in a living room, or bed room or library I could make you a pastel say 16 x 20 in size for fourty dollars  I have made some of these that were very satisfactory.  I recently made some 8 x 10 sepia portraits for","8507fae65418321778278f16897e02e4.jpg"],[69430,"H. S.

I made five Ivory miniatures of Fred Harvey, of the Santa e eating house system a few years ago.   anything I should make for you would be guaranteed to be perfectly satisfactory.  If you [illegible] of these suggestions meet your approval if you will let me know for what purpose you want the picture I may be able to suggest something further. - I have a friend in Chicago, an artist who does this class of work.  Suppose I have him call and talk with about the picture.  He could bring some samples and then you could more readily decide as to what","33df10633f547325d990df3e66c5c50a.jpg"],[69431,"H. S.

Yes indeed I was glad to get another letter from our old home. You must have had many sad reflections alone in the old house with mother. How much of joy and sadness we have all experienced within its walls, and how little of either, remain, both seem to have been crowded out of our hearts and their places supplied by a stolid indifference. at least it is so with me. I find that I am losing all taste for the Agency society. My time is so occupied during the day that I have no time for the little amenities which are usually practiced in society, and at night I am studying, and find company an intolerable nuisance. Some evenings I am too stupid to study but even then","22ede5c143a45b7eef7ac6bb39024904.jpg"],[68494,"I seldom leave my room.

I wrote you of him I believe. He is a Captain in the 11th Infantry + commands H Company. Said to be the best in the Regmt. G. has a hard name as a disciplinarian, but I found him a most agreeable gentleman. He is forty years old, six feet two inches in height and weighs 220 but is a fine looking fellow. He was here two weeks and spent every evening save one in my room. He gave me a very cordial invitation to visit him at Custer, saying that there was a good room at his quarters at my disposal and that he would take me to the Custer battle ground, and make my stay as pleasant as possible.

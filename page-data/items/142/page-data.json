To acknowledge God in his natural and moral perfections as he has manifested them in his word and works.  To love him for his infinite perfections, holiness and goodness.  To fear to offend him and submit cheerfully to his will, this is to praise God, and do him all the honor we are capable.  But in order to praise God in this way, it is not enough to acknowledge, love, reverence, and submit to him inward by (in the heart).  But there maybe added also the fruit of two lips giving thanks to his name.  The apostle defined what it was to offer and to and sacrifice of praise by saying is was the fruit of two lips giving thanks to his name.","452c29f6604080e01de547888f4a9231.jpg"],[33293,"agreeably to this likewise said the priest.  I will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will I sing praise unto thee.  I will worship towards thy holy temple and praise thy name for thy loving kindness and thy truth.

In there expressions of real and true devotedness to God, we are likewise to sing his praise and make a joyful noise unto him who is the rock of our salvation.  In this way we shall become as the apostle Peter expressed it, a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to go through  Jesus Christ.  \nWe shall praise him by offering up our holy affections of love repentance and all other graces, and celebrate his goodness, mercy and grace.  To do this is to praise God, with one fruit of the lips giving thanks to his name.  But secondly, to offer these sacrifices of praise to God continually imports","680e02bfaad18d3ed6a4ae2b1673906e.jpg"],[33295,"a continued service of them through life in the stated seasons of private and sarial ?l worship morning and evening and on the Sabbath.  To praise God continually, is to maintain a temper of mind always suitable for praising him, and actually to engage directly in the benefits, at all stated seasons of divine appointment, as also to honor him by an universal outward obedience.\nThirdly, to praise God continually implies ultimately, the honoring him with heart and voice at all special seasons of divine mercy and kindness, these usually occur at two in gathering of every year.

Let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing.  Now to do this is a gospel manner is to acknowledge God with heart, and voice, to love him for his infinite perfections and excellence, to adore his majesty and submit our souls to his will through Christ.

I think it could be done. Of course we have an election next spring and possibly the town might be carried for a Loyal Mayer and Council? if it could a Marshall would be appointed by him and then of course the Saloons would be closed.

I have no respect for office holders who will perjure themselves for a Saloon or for any other purpose. I hope the Republican Party will do their duty the coming year will they do it. ?

I mean that local capital will be invested in cattle paper at better rates that real estate loans.

The action of the Gymanfa is its sessions at Tabernacle, Scranton in September, 1916, was endorsed by the Quarterly Meeting held at Wilkes-Barre, June 9, 1917, and the original Committee was urged to go on with the project. They called representatives of the Churches to meet at Pittston to discuss the question and to receive suggestions, and in this meeting a number of able men were asked to co-operate with them, and we hereby acknowledge our gratitude to Mr. Oliver Rhydderch of Edwardsville and Mr. Gomer Rees of Plymouth for their work and labor of love. This work is the result of our conferences and deliberations. We have endeavored to avoid surplus matter in its preparation. We sought a Hymnal not to adorn our pews, but to serve our Congregations in their devotion and worship, quality not quantity has been our motto. We have attempted to retain the tunes that bear the characteristics of the Welsh people, and have yoked them to the best available English Hymns so that the younger generations may learn and sing the Hymns and tunes that have been the means of such rich spiritual blessings to their ancestors, and have marked the nation as being one of the foremost in their Congregational singing. It will be a valuable connecting link between the past, present, and future generations. It will contain not less than 140 of the best tunes of present and past composers and over 400 of the choicest Hymns suitable for all seasons and occasions in the Christian year. It will be published in two bindings and sold for 50 and 75 cents respectively. It will also contain several commendable features that are to be found in the leading Hymnals of the larger denominations in this and in the old country, such as the Apostle's Creed, the Congregationalists declaration of faith, the ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer and several forms of benediction, together with about thirty pages of responsive readings in Welsh and in English.\nNo labor has been spared to make it a most valuable contribution to our Churches in their present condition. We offer it with great confidence that it will meet with the approval of all unprejudiced minds, and that it will add to the dignity and efficiency of our praise. Our Churches and others who are in need of a good substantial and inexpensive Hymnal are invited to correspond and send their orders to the Secretary of the Committee.\nYours in the Master's service,\nREV.

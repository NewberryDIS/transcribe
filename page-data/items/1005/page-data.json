I went to Washington primarily to procure an appointment for my son, and went to see how the land laid for Army legislation, and what chances there was for any bill.  As I expected  found the Committees overwhelmed with bills and letters from officers, differing in opinion as wide as the poles are apart, as one said to me we are willing to do for the officers, but \"we dont believe you  [underline 4 words]","25acf09bf49214f62de74ef02bc47a1a.jpg"],[65989,"produce something, if the Army responded to the call and send in their subscriptions, but * doubt it, for they have handicapped their, well known [2 word underline] committe, by, forcing a measure upon them which helps only the Capts. and Lieutenants, they, the originators, have decided what measures are to be presented, without consultation or advise from the Army at large.

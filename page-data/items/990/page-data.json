Of the first I have felt no hesitation in declaring my [word] of its falsehood.  And of the second I have said, that whatever course you have taken, it has been the result of a sense of duty — that I have no information on the subject,  except that when parted you were on your way to the nation for the purpose of expediting the departure of the friendly indians.\nYours truly,\nWm W Bibb","9f15c5290d6c55070c4fa19a15f312fe.jpg"],[63835,"D B Mitchell Esqr\nMilledgeville\nGeorgia\nupside down at bottom:\nW.

Two others took the wood and goldenrod, and passed them to another two, keeping them in motion, till the weed, and then the wood, took fire; and with the brands[?] the altar fire was lighted.\n\tThe form of divination subjsituted for the more anchient one,__which has been already described by us in narrating that part of the great national propitiation festival immediately succeeding the sacrifice of the deer's tongue,_ __was as follows:\n\tThe hunter, on their return, had given the [u] Oole, Stool, eeh [/u], the skin of a buck,  of a doe and of a fawn. These he spread west of the fire, with the heads towards the fire and the east; having the flesh side up. He then took a little bunch of weeds, or grass, and dipped it in fresh blood, either of a deer or fowls, and drew a streak of blood on the skins from the tail to the head. On this streak of blood in the middle of the buckskin he set his [u] Ooh, lung, sah, [du] tah [/du][/u], and also seven strands of beads, one representing each clan.\n\tThe [u] Ooh, lung, sah, [du] tah [/du][/u],__ or Divining Chrystal, was now examined.__\n[JF?]","fed257cdaa4e9e494315a9a68250d060.jpg"],[69965,"149\nIf the season was to be sickly, it would appear smoky and bluish. If healthy, it would shine dazzlingly, without smoke.\n\tNext, the beads were consulted. In his right hand, the priest took up by turns the strings of beads representing the respective clans, and inferred the omens of health, or the reverse, from the movements of the beads as he held them.\n\tIn reference to the last of the series, the Sixth, called [u] Eelah, wahtah, lay [du] kee [/du][/u], __the Festival of the Exulting, or Bounding, Bush,__we only find that the man who formerly appeared at the beginning and on the fourth midnight, with a box, was [?] more recently; but the other forms were retained.\n\tOf this festival it has also been remarked that though, for many years, it has been performed at various seasons, as best suited the people's convenience and inclination, it is known to have been always observed in earlier times annually on the later part of the first autumnal new moon.\n[centered horizontal line]\n\t\tThe modernisations of the occasional","d081d33a842b0b8e34267fc170473a9d.jpg"],[69966,"150\nOccasional Festivals, come at present under review. \n\tWe have already stated that the elders among the Cherokee represent the [u] Ah, tah, hung, nah, [/u] as having been resorted to for relief against every case of public distress, in consequence of the express bidding of the Great Supreme.__ Hence in the earliest times it was under such exigencies celebrated entire;__ more recently, however, it became modified in reference to divers calamities, but never without retaining enough of the original to render the derivation obvious.\n\tWhen we say that the elders among the Cherokee attribute the occasional employ of the [u] Ah, tawh, hung, nah, [/u] to the special injunction of the Great Supreme, from whose displeasure they considered mortal diseases, and severe inflictions of every kind, to arise,__but who, tempering justice with mercy, prescribed an atonement while he doomed,__ we must not omit to mention that there is a different view of the subject, even among some of the best informed of the aged natives. These look upon the idea of a direct command from the Deity as a modern one. They believe that, as the decoction employed at the annual festival was regarded as a \nwater","4f5a37ddded636f9feaaf7d061ee2122.jpg"],[69967,"151\nwater of purification; and that, as there was supposed to be a purifying and averting influence in all the prayers and sacrifices and other characteristics of the occasion, the supposed efficacy of the festival naturally occurred to those who desired to turn aside judgements from on high; and so at last it was gradually brought into more frequent use than acient custom warranted. Hence the later \"Physic Dance,\" the title where-of is so significant; and which festival, though differing in many particulars from the ancient [u] Ah, tawh, hung, nah, [/u] is evidently borrowed from it.\n\tIt will be also seen, that, under whatever modification it chanced to assume, the [u] Ah, tawh, hung, nah, [/u] formed the basis of all the occasional deprecatory ceremonies; although varied more or less when Contagious Fevers, & other epidemics prevailed; __ and, __ in times nearer to our own, on the appearance of the SmallPox;__ and yet to a greater degree, in cases which will be named subsequently.\n\tThese changes we proceed to notice. Having portrayed the first two, we shall mention the others, equally derived from the [u] Ah, tawh, hung, nah, [/u] but intermingled with heterogenous forms, evidently \nintroduced","057e6605e562771936dca4559098498e.jpg"],[69968,"152\nintroduced by the worshippers of the Sun, or Moon, or by the Impostors now called among the Indians Conjurers, and who are commonly ranked with the sects just mentioned, although it is scarecly probable that many of them worship aught except themselves. The conjurers in question aided their practices upon the credulity of the people by an occasional recurrence to the ancient orthodox rites which are even yet remembered, notwithstanding their origin and signification has long since been forgotten.\n\tWe now begin our view of the changes made in the occasional Festivals, with the first modification of the [u] Ah, tawh, hung, nah, [/u] as it was used to avert contagious fevers and other similar epidemics.\n\tThe ceremonies introductory to this Festival were as follows:\n\tWhen disease was apprehended, or prevailed, the town assembled and requested the Seven Counsellors of the Town/Priest to make arrangements for preventing or stopping it. They accordingly gave him notice, by one of their number. They then selected a [u] Yo, wah, teekanaw, ghistee [/u], [line over 'naw'] __ or [u] Yowah [/u] chaunter;__a person to dress and undress him; seven men to hunt; seven women to lead the sacred dance; one or two music-\n-ians,","cb7f0168b9dfcbbb9c98d13e443b2b57.jpg"],[69969,"153\nmusicians, or [u] ki, ni, wi, sti, ski [/u] and a priest to direct the ceremonies of the festival, which was to commence on the evening of the seventh day next evening.\n\tThe [u] Oolee, stool, eeh, [/u] or presiding priest, went at once in pursuit of the herbs and roots for the occasion. They were seven in number, and the same as the articles of purification saught simultaneously with the hunt for the uses of the [u] Ah, tawh, hung, nah, [/u] in connection with which they have been already named. As each was gathered, a special prayer was required to be uttered over it, naming the purpose to which it was destined, and imploring that it might be empowered to effect that purpose. As also beforementioned among the particulars of the modified form of the same [u] Ah, tawh, hung, nah, [/u] seven kinds of wood were brought and arranged in a circle, which seven kinds of beads pointing towards them. The wood, though sometimes kindled by rubbing, was sometimes lighted from a flint. When burning, both wood and fire were put aside to make the fire for boiling the herbs.\n\tA little before sunset on the Seventh day, the people assembled in the Town Council House, and took their seats in silence; and the Festival might be considered as begun.\nThose","65c627a4e57e90ddd0fa6e027ed85d27.jpg"],[69970,"155\n[u] Ah, tawh, hung, nah, [/u] watching the coldron and fire night and daty.\n\tAt this moment, the entire assembly were seated.\n\tThe [u] ki, ni, wi, sti, ski [/u], or musician, now took his stand. Uplifting his voice, he struck a sort of drum he had, and the seven women appointed to lead the dance, came forward. With a slow step, they moved around the fire in single file, followed by all the other women, and they by the girls; thus forming large circles within circles. The first dance being ended, the [u] Yo, wah, teekanaw, ghistee [/u], [line over 'naw'] __ or [u] Yowah [/u] chaunter was called, as at the Ah, tawh, hung, nah,__ the Propitation or Cementation, Festival,__ and after him, the seven cleansers, or exorcisers; and all the proceeded in every respect as at the parent festival. The moment both returned, the women resumed their dance, continuing it all night.\n\tAt sunrise, on the following day, the \n[u] Oolee, stool, eeh, [/u] or presiding priest,__ with his face turned towards the east, prayed. He then dipped the gourd among the herbs which had been all night boiling, and gave some of the drink to each of the seven counsellors, who each tasted & then presented it to one of his own clan (each respective)","7c26303efd26dd6de69482ca75216a53.jpg"],[69992,"[u] 7 Clans.

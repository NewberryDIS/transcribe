A few years since I presumed to transmit to your honors a few historical Collections concerning the Indians in New England, especially The Christian or praying Indians, which script (as things then stood) was a true account of that matter(1). And were I to write it again (as things were then circumstanced) I could not add or diminish from the substance of it. But since the war began between the barbarous heathen and the English, the state of affairs is much altered with respect to the poor christian Indians who are much weakened or diminished, especially in the Colony of Massachusetts in N. England. In true impartial narration whereof, and of their doings, sufferings and present condition, I have endeavored to collect, and here humbly to offer for your honors perusal, who are, under God, as nursing fathers to this despised orphan.

Fear restrain some, & interest nearly, if not all, in some measure. The two principal historians of this critical period were Mr. Hubbard, & Dr. I. Mather. The former was a most amiable writer, considering the period in which he wrote, but the latter was greatly\nCont.' on p. 2 of notes","349093ea60feaf669460c1cd853020f2.jpg"],[67098,"5\n\nthe poor Indians in New England, to give them right information how these Christian natives have demeaned themselves in this hour of tribulation. And therefore (through divine assistance) I shall endeavour to give a particular & real account of this affair. Before I come to declare matter of fact I shall premise some things necessary to be understood for the better clearing of our ensuing discourse. \nThe Christian Indians in New England have their dwellings in sundry jurisdictions of the English colonies, & that at a considerable distance from each other, more particularly. \nI. Upon the island of Nantucket  & Martha's viniard(1), in which two islands there {are}[crossed out] inhabitants['ants' crossed out] many, hundreds of them that visibly profess the gospel(2). These Indians have felt very little of this war comparatively, for the English that dwell upon those islands have held a good correspondency with those Indians all the time of the war, as they did before the war began. The only sufferings of these Christian Indians was of their coming up in the summer during the war to work for the English in the Mas. Colony, whither many scores of them did usually repair to work; whereby they & their families were accommodated with necessary clothing, which is scarce & dear upon those islands. Besides several of these Indians belonging to the islands being at work at some of the English towns \n(1) This island was so named from Martin Prin[first and last name underlined] or Pring[underlined], its first discoverer. For a particular account of the Christian Indians there see Experience Mayhew's \"Indian Converts,\" 8°. London, 1727, and Matthew Mayhew's Brief Nar. 12°. Boston, 1694. (2) In 1694[first written \"1695\" corrected to \"1694\"] Mr. M. Mayhew reckoned there were \"about three thousand.\"","3658617808ef2316e4d1a44103165aae.jpg"],[67099,"6\nwhen the war began in the summer of 1675 were not permitted to stay in the colonies, but were forced to pack away to their own habitations to their great loss. Because the English were so jealous & filled with animosity against all Indians without exception, hereby they tasted but little of the effects of the war, & therefore they will not so properly fall under our consideration. \nII. Another considerable number of Christian Indians live within the jurisdiction of new Plymouth called the cape Indians; these also (through gods favor) have enjoyed much peace & quiet by their English neighbors, & several of them have served the English in the war, especially in the heat of the war, & did acquit themselves courageously & faithfully(1). Indeed at the beginning of the war the English of that colony were suspicious of them & slow to improve any of them in the war, though divers of those Christian Indians manifested themselves ready & willing to engage with the English against their enemies, & this is so much the more remarkable that those Indians proved so faithful to the English interest considering the war first began in the colony of Plymouth, by the rashness and folly of Philip Chief Sachem of the Indian in those parts, unto whom or to some of his people doubtless these praying Indians were allied by affinity or consanguinity. Therefore good reason it is to attribute it to the grace & favor of god, & to the ef- \n(1) The celebrated Church performed scarcely an expedition or exploit without the help of some of these Indians. He had a happy faculty of winning their affections and all of them proved true to him. With the unfortunate Capt. Peirse there went out 20 warriors from the Cape Indians, & but few returned. There was scarce any war or rumor but what some of those Indians were among the first volunteers and they continued in the ranks of the Eng. as long as there were any of them left.","dcd5e822a816ae3710c22f8c69a725c6.jpg"],[67100,"ficacy of religion upon their hearts that they carried it so well in this war, the greatest suffering these underwent was, being impeded by the war to come and work in harvest among the English whereby they had a good helper to get apparel. These also do not fall so properly under consideration in this narrative. \nIII. There were a few other Praying Indians, about 40 persons, that began to embrace the Christian religion who lived near to New Norwich in Connecticut Colony, who were taught by that worthy and Rev.d minister, Mr. James Fitch[underlined], pastor at Norwich, who had taken much pains to declare the gospel to the Indians in these parts. But the chief Sachem, Uncas, & his eldest son Orneko(1) not being encouragers of the cristian religion (though otherwise they & their people have joined with the English in the war & proved faithful, especially against their ancient & implacable enemies the Narragensets(underlined), I say this Sachem & people being generally averse to entertain Christian religion, or countenance any such as did among his people incline to it, hence it came to pass that those few in those parts that prayed to god are not distinguishable from the rest, and so nothing of remark is spoken of any of them, and hence will not be subjects of this discourse. \nIV. The fourth & not the least company of Christian Indians are those that inhabit the jurisdiction \n(1) Oneko, commonly written. For particulars in the lives of both father & son see my Indian Biog. 3d Ed.","e022257f467af0190abe038ca5aa16d4.jpg"],[67101,"8\nor colony of Connecticut[crossed out] Mas. who were taught & instructed in the Christian faith lay that indefatigable servant of god & minister of Christ Mr. John Elliot, (who hath also laboured[letter \"u\" crossed out] among all the praying Indians in New England more or less for about 30 years, but more especially among those of Mas. Colony. And of these Indians, it is, I shall principally speak, who have felt more of the effects of this war than all the rest of the Christian Indians, and may appear in that which ensues. \nFor the better understanding of the following discourse we are to know that all these praying Indians dwelt upon the south side of  Merrimack river, and inhabited several villages viz.,Wamesit(1), Nashoba(2), Okkokonimesit, alias Marlborough, Hassannamesit(3), Makunkokoag(4), Natick, & Punkapog(5), alias Pakomet, these were for distinction's sake called the old praying Indian towns, for there were 5 or 6 small villages of the Nipmuck Indians that had some people in them inclining to entertain the gospel, therefore were called the new praying towns. But those latter being but raw & lately initiated in to the christian profession, most of them fell off from the English & joined with the enemy in the war, some few excepted whose hearts god had turned that came in to Okkokonimesit or Marlborough & lived among the praying Indians, they were drawn together there until such time as the one & other were driven & drawn away among the \n(1) Formerly Chelmsford, chiefly now included in Lowell. \n(2)  Now sufficiently pointed out by Nashua. \n(3) Grafton. \n(4) Hopkinton\n(5) Stoughton","92cb5ab1eb251602155523985674de03.jpg"],[67102,"9\n\nenemy as shall afterward (god willing) be declared. I am therefore principally to speak of the christian Indians belonging to the old praying town above mentioned. \nThe situation of these towns was such that the Indians in them might have been improved as a wall of defence, about the greatest part of the colony of Mas.ts for the first named of those villages bordered upon the Merrimack river, & the rest in order about 12 or 14 miles asunder, including most of the frontiers, & had the suggestion and importunate solicitations of some persons who had knowledge & experience of the fidelity & integrity of the Praying Indians been attended & practiced in the beginning of the war, many & great mischiefs might have been (according to reason prevented) for most of the praying towns in the beginning of the war had put themselves into a posture of defence, & had made forts for their security against the common enemy & it was suggested & proposed to the authority of the country that some English men, about one third part, might have been joined with those Christian Indians in each fort, which the praying Indians greatly desired, that thereby their fidelity might have been better demonstrated, and that with the assistance & company of some of those English soldiers, they might daily scout or range the woods from town to town in their several assi-","62a35e6b8574f0db53a4cf33f8481217.jpg"],[67103,"10[curly underline]\ngned stations, & hereby might have been as a living wall to guard the English frontiers, & consequently the greatest part of the jurisdiction which with the blessing of god might have been prevented the desolations & devastations that afterward ensued. This was not only the suggestion of some English, but the earnest desire of some of the most prudent of the christian Indians who in all their actions declared that they were greatly ambitious to give demonstration to the English of their fidelity & good affection for them & the interest of christian religion, & to endeavour all that in them lay to abate & take off the animosity & displeasure that they perceived was enkindled in some English against them, & hence it was that they were always found ready to comply cheerfully with all commands of the English authority. But such was the unhappiness of their affairs, or rather the displeasure of god in the case, that those counsels were rejected, & on the contrary, a spirit of enmity & hatred concieved by many against those poor christian Indians, as I apprehend, without cause, & for as I could ever understand, which was, according to the operation of second causes, a very great occasion of many distressing calamities that befell both one & the other. \nThe great god who overruleth & ordereth all councils & actions for the bringing to pass his own purpose & desire, was pleased to darken this","87991f2d017bc392d4ca0f24776b395a.jpg"],[67104,"counsel from such as had the power to put it in practice. And although there was a demonstration near hand in the colony of Con.ct for the benefit of such a course as was before proposed & desired in keeping a fair correspondence with their neighbor Indians[underlined], the Mohegans[underlined] & Pequods[underlined], who were not only improved by the English[underlined] in all their expeditions, but were on guard to the frontiers whereby those Indians upon the account of their own interest (for they had no principles of Christianity to fix them to the English)  proved very faithful & serviceable to the English, & under god were instrumental for the preservation of that colony, which had but one small deserted village burnt in this war(1), & very little of their other substance destroyed by the enemy. I have often considered this matter, & come to this result in my own thoughts, that the most holy & righteous god hath overruled all counsels & affairs in this & other things relating to this war, for such wise, just & holy ends as these. [The following words appear in the right-hand margin] The Town of Simsbury, (Massaco.)\nI. To make a rod of the barbarous heathen to chastise & punish the English for their sins, the Lord had, as our faithful ministers often declared, applied more gentle has chastisements (gradually) to his New Eng. people, but those proving in great measure ineffectual to produce effectual humiliation & reformation, hence the righteous & holy Lord is necessitated to draw forth this smarting rod of the vile & brutish heathen, who indeed have been a very, very scourge unto N.

To teach war to the young generations of N. Eng. who had never been acquainted with it, & especially to teach old & young how little confidence is to be put in an arm of flesh, and to let them see if god give commission to a few (comparatively) of naked men to execute any work of god, how insignificant nothings are numbers of men well armed, & provided, and endowed with courage & valor to oppose & conquer the enemy, until god turn the balance. It was observed by some judicious that at the beginning of the war, the Eng. soldiers made nothing of the Indians. & many spake words to this effect that one Eng. man was sufficient to chase 10 indians(1), many reckoned it was no other, but veni, vidi, vici(2). Surely the Lord well knew that if he should have given his people victory, before they were in some measure corrected of this sin of trusting in an arm of flesh, that little glory would accrue to his name by such a deliverance. \nIII. The purging & trying the faith & patience off the godly Eng. & christ[superscript]n Indians, certainty was another end god aimed at in this chastisement. And the discovery of hypocrisy & wickedness in some that were ready to cry aha[underlined], at the sore calamity upon Eng. people in this war, & as much as in them lay to overthrow god's work in gospelizing the poor Inds. \nIV. Doubtless one great end god aimed at was the punishment & destruction of many of the wicked heathen, whose iniquities were now full; the last period whereof, was their malignant opposition to the offers of the gospel, for the Pakanahats(3) & The Narragansets, those two great nations, upon whom the dint\n(1)This is true of all who wrote at the time, especially Dr. I. Mather & The anonymous author of the \"Letters to London.\"\n(2) The language of Caesar.\n(3) Pokanokets probably.","54f7c9948679b51955b9c9eb9d48e638.jpg"],[67106,"of war had most especially fallen, for they are almost totally destroyed, had one & again the gospel offered to them. But their chief Sachem malignantly rejected & opposed it, & consequently the people followed their examples(1). And notwithstanding they were very conversant among the Eng., especially the Narra.*, & commendable for their industry & labor among the Eng., yet had the most of y [superscript m] [English manuscript abbreviation for \"them\"] no hearing ears unto the glad tidings of salvation offered in the gospel, & very few of them delighted in communion with the christ. [superscript n] Indians. And here I shall insert a matter of remark. After the war began with Philip, the Eng. having cause to be suspicious of the Narragansets, unclear some soldiers to MR. Smith's of Wickford, that lived near them, designing thereby to put upon them a necessity to declare themselves friends or enemies, & to push upon them the performance of former articles of agreement between the Eng. & Them. At which time, being in July, 1675, they complied to a treaty (2) of continuing in peace and friendship with the English. But among other articles, the Narragansets by their agent unclear, urged that the Eng. should not send any among them to preach the gospel or call upon them to pray to god. But the Eur. refusing to concede to such an article, it was withdrawn, & a peace concluded for that time. In this act they declared what their hearts were, viz. to reject Christ & his grace offered to them before. \nBut the lord jesus before the expedition of 18 men unclear destroyed the body of the Narag. nation, that would","36525e8095e6e414e6a3af920f54a65c.jpg"],[67107,"14\nnot have him to reign over them, particularly ___ their chief schemes, of this potiehc?, a chief counselor, and subtle fellow who was ta kew? at Rhode Island, coming voluntarily there, and afterward sent to Boston and there executed.  \nV.   And lastly to mention no more, this doubtless was another end the God of heaven aimed at in this war, that he might magnify his rich and free grace in saving and delivering his poor unclear people at last and destroying the greater part of the enemy, and subduing others under them, and this was by his own hand briefly? done thereby magnifying his grace in answering the incessant prayers of the people of god in England, Ireland, and Scotland, as well as in unclear. But I shall forbear to ass any more of this king and proceed now to declare matter of fact. \n1675.    In April, before the war broke forth, above two months, there being the march proceeding some agitations between the government of Plym and Philip Schem of Mount Hope, unclear the murder of one John Pasamend?, \"one of the Christ.\" Indians belonging to Mas., but at that time her lived in Plym. Col. near Jamestown? and was a minister to some christian inds. Thereabout. And Philip was unclear suspected to be the contriver of this murder, thoug executed by others. The story whereof is more particularly set down by Mr. Mather and Mr. William Hubbard?, in their histories of the war, which has spared me the labor to recite it in this place; only this much I may say pertinent to my purpose, that this John Ialamand? was the first christian martyr of the \n(1) In my B.K.

I say about this time, the beginning of April, Waban?, the principal taler of the pray. inds.? living at unclear, came to one of the magistrates on purpose and informed him that he had ground to hear that Lachen Philip and other Indians his confederates intended unclear chief shortly to the Eng. and Christ Inds. Again in May about 6 weeks before the war began he came again and renewed the lame. Others called of the christ Inds. did speak the lame thing; and that when the woods were grown thick with green trees, then it was likely to appear earnestly desiring that care might be had and means used for prevention, at least for preparation for such a thing, and a month after the war began. About the 21 of June, at the first going forth of the Eng. were only employed as soldiers, excepting only 3 Inds for guides went with Capt. Prentice, unclear one James and Thomas unclear alias?\nRumney March, and Zachary Abram who all behaved themselves valiantly and faithfully. The Eng. at frist thought easily to chastise the insolent doings and murderous practices of the heathen. But it was found another manner of think than was expected, for our men could see no enemy to shoot at, but yet felt their bullets out of the think bushes where they lay in ambushments?. The enemy also used this stratagem, to apparel themselves from the waist upward with green boughs that our Eng. m. could not readily disarm them, or distinguish them from the natu-\n(1) Or wanban, whose name signified a wind?: he was the fist chief to profess Christianity, and entertained Mr. Elist in his wigwam, at his first going among the Indians as a preacher in their own language, 28 Oct. 1666.\n(2) It is pretty please that Lassamon was a pardon on whom not even the English would now rely, and that he was without much principle further then selfishness?  was concerned.

The Eng. wanted not courage, or resoluation, but could not discern or find an enemy to fight with, yet were galled by the enemy The council having advice hereof from the commanders of the army, judged it very necessary to unclear and lend forth some of the pray. Inds. to assist our forces hereby not only to try their fidelity, but to unclear the better with the enemy in their own ways and methods, according to the Ind. manner of fighting wherein our Indians were well skilled, and had unclear council practiced, and also to be as scouts and unclear to the Eng.; for the Inds. generally excel in a quick and strong sight for the discovery of anything, and then they have a very accurate sagacity in discovering the tracks of man or beast. And also they are subtle and willing? to accomplish their enterprise, especially to keep a deep silence in their marches and motions whereas the Eng. are more prone to talk to one another, and make a noise, whereby the enemy unclear covering them before they come near, either prepare for them or take their flight, as is most unclear their advantage. And here I shall take leave, as parenthesis, to insert a short and true story of an Indian? chief capt. under Lukas, who marching in this war unclear scouts with some Eng. soldiers of Cou., one of the Eng. soldiers had on a new pair of shoes that made a unclear king noise as they travelled. That Indian capt. unclear not quiet until he had persuaded the fellow with creating shoes to take his moccasins and wear them and ...\n(1) Something seems to be wanting? here to make sense, or perhaps some word is missing by the author, or mistaken by the transcriber.\n(2) All early writers agree in this. - Who mention it at...","3b8743f7a5ecd39a478eca725998b204.jpg"],[67110,"2nd. carried the Eur. mans shows at his back & went? himself barefoot. Another Eur. soldier had ona pair of leather breeches which being dry made a rustling noise, the 2nd. Capt. was not satisfied until he had persuaded the man to take off his breeches, or else to wet them in the water to prevent their rustling. By this relation which is a truth we may observe how circumspect & careful they are in order to obtain advantage of their enemies. \n1675, July 2, But to proceed to our purpose. The governor & council gave their orders to Maj. Daniel Gookin (unto whom a peculiar inspection & government of the praying? Inds. was committed by authority of the gen. court) to raise a company of the praying Indians for unclear to be armed & furnished & sent to the unclear at Mt. Hope. In pursuance whereof the Maj. forthwith sent to all the praying Indians for one third part of their able men who all readily & cheerfully appeared, & being enlisted were about 52 (1). These being armed & furnished were sent to the army under Conduct of Capt. Isaac Johnson, the 6 of July, 1675, who returned back after he had delivered them to Major Savage, commander in Chief of the army at Mt. Hope. How those Inds. behaved themselves I shall say little, not being an eye witness thereof, but both Maj. Savage, Cap. Prentiss, & Cap. unclear, Chief officers in the army, give testimony, that the most of them acquitted themselves courageously & faithfully as many appear by a certificate? (in the close of this treatise) under their hands. \n(1) Hence the able men among the Preying Indians at this time amounted to about 156.","1ad77b7f75356b616d755d65a5b7fde7.jpg"],[67111,"At this time the pray'g.

Notwithstanding the certificate which hereafter follows, & is before touched, concerning the courage & fidelity of our Ch.

This I do also know upon my own personal knowledge, that some of those INdian soldiers at their return, viz. John Hunter, \n(1) Son of Edward Tyng, was born 15 Dec, 1642, & died 19 Jan. 1724.

In this expedition one of our principal soldiers of the prey Inds. was slain, a valiant & stout man named Job Sesutan, he was a very good linguist in the Esp tongue, & was Mr. Elliot's assistant and interpreter in his translation of the Bible to the books in the Ind. language (1) The loss of such a useful and trusty man was great in forementioned respects. Besides another stout ind of 86 was wounded by accident, & lost the use of his right arm, his name Thos Rumney Marsh, manner thus; he being a horseman, as is before hinted, under Cap.

But our men, & particular the Mohe.n & Sast Inds. behaved themselves with such courage & activity, as was certified by letter (1) from Mr. Newman of Rehobak, minister that was present in the fight, that they slew 14 of the enemy's principal men, & wounded ive others where of one Nimorod (2), a chief cap. & counsel to Philip was one slain, also they took a considerable booty which the Mohn.

But he tho't it not prudent to break his small company(for the Providence, Jamestown and Leekouk men were all gone home) and to hazard so few, as 8 Inds. were against so considerable and numerous as Philip was apprehended then to be. But as we were also certainly informed that Philip was so distressed and clogged at that time, his ammunition almost spend; also, the squaw Sachem and her people with Wompouoges (his greatest strength) drawn off from them to the unclear., that he had little above 50 able men left, but many hundreds of old men, women, and child; so that if the counsel of out christian Inds. had been put in practice, according to rational probability, they had taken or slain Philip, and so restored his motion, that the rest might have come up with him and destroyed his party.

The bones were unclear large, particularly the skulls, which can be shipped? over the largest man's head. The upper jaw bone has two rows of teeth all unclear; the under but two on the left side and? no socket, provided by unclear in the bone for unclear. The skulls, with considerable quantitie? of further ware, fuck? unclear, and muscle shells, were all buried in time two feet deep.\nAt fort Charters was found a human skull of astonishing magnitude. A jaw bone was taken from the mound near Natchez?, which the gentleman who jaw it could with ease put over his face; unclear a leg bone which from the ground reached three inches  above the knee. (unclear, 155; Brackenbridge?, 279.) Many other instances might be enumerated?, to establish the position, that a race of men of much larger bulk than any in America, unclear unclear day, formerly resided unclear the Cumberland river and it, waters, and upon the Tennefree?, and it, water, and below them, upon the unclear as well as upon the rivers mouth of Cumberland and in one part of Virginia.\" p. 360.\n\"At the distance of about 4? miles southwest? of unclear, on the unclear of the Cany Fork, are the unclear of","7042d0905336af23cd922a14749c3dcc.jpg"],[72068,"of an ancient unclear, containing about five acres, perfectly unclear. The wall being unclear entirely of dirt, as appears from the preferrd? state of it unclear. Here is a great burying place. The human she? belong? discovered here, as remarkable for their gigantic stature. From all that can now be unclear, their must have been a race of men averaging at about 7 feet in height. Such men, it is probable, never gre in the tropical climate. No instance is recollected, of giants between unclear unclear. Some were planted by the Scythians in Palestine, when in a very distant age they penetrated as far as to confines of Egypt, and built the city of  Scythopolis.

But many of the southern? tribes have unclear the barbarous custom of unclearthe heads of their children between two board, in imitation, no doubt, of the Mexican born, which, in their estimation, was beautiful, or in some way advantageous. And here it may not be amits? to mention, that the Chilians, who unclear fur to the south of the equator, as formerly did the Scythians, unclear, vandals, unclear & Germans, so remarkable in ancient times? for their unclear stature, did on the other side of it, (1 unclear 233. 234. 236. 237: unclear,111, 114?, 197 vertical line with three horizontal lines going through it 502.) were men of large stature. 199.\n_____\"Then length & dimensions of the skeletons which are found in East unclear Tennessee \"____\" will prove demonstratively, that the ancient inhabitants of this country, either the primitive unclear settler, were men of gigantic stature, compared with the present races of Indians. On the farm of Mr John Miller, of White county, are a number of small graves, and also many large ones, the bones of which show that the bodies to which they belonged, when alive, must have been seven feet, and upwards. About the year 1814, Mr? unclear found","3ad3f40d8e1dcd2d42bb718d8b74cc62.jpg"],[72070,"found, in Scarborough's cave, which is on the Calf Killer river, a branch of the Cany fork, about 12 or 15 miles from Sparta, in a little unclear in the cave, many human bones of a monstrous size. He took a jaw bone and applied it to his own face, & where his chin touched the concave of the chinbone, the hinder ends of the jaw bone did not touch the skin of his face on either side. He took a thigh bone and applied the upper end of it to his own hip joint, and the lower end reached four inches below the knee joint. Mr Andrew Bryan saw a grave opened about 4 miles northwardly from Sparta, on the Calf Killer fork. He took a thigh bone, and raising? up his knee, he applied the knee joint of the bone to the extreme length of his own knee, the upper end of the bone passed out behind him as far as the full width of his body. Mr Lawrence is about 5 feet 10 inches, high, and Mr Bryant is about 5 feet 9. Mr Sharp Whitely was in a cave near the place, where Mr Bryan saw the graves opened. In it, were many of these bones. The skull, lie plentifully in it, and all the other bones of the human body; all in proportion & of monstrous size. Human bones were taken out of a mound on Tennessee river, below Kingston, which Mr unclear jaw by Mr Simms. The Thigh bones of these skeletons, when applied to Mr Simms' thigh","b02e3b5368180818278dced6e1d57a1a.jpg"],[72071,"were an inch and a half longer than his, from the point of his hip to his knee: supporting the whole frame to have been in the same proportion, the body Sit belonged to must have been seven feet high or upwards. Many bones in the mound, here, are of equal size. Suppose a man seven or? eight feet high, that is from 18 inches to two feet taller than men of the common size; suppose the body broaden in the same proportion, also his arms and legs; would he not be entitled to the name giant? Colonel? William Sheppard, late of North Carolina, in the year 1807, dug up, on the plantation of Colonel? Joel Lewis?, 2 miles from Nashville, the jaw bones of a man, which easily covered the whole chin & jaw of Colonel? Lewis, a man of large size. Some year afterwards, Mr Cassidy? dug up a skeleton from under a small mound near the large one at Bledsoe's Lick, in Sumner county, which measured little short of seven feet in length. Human bones have been dug up at the plantation where Judge Neuton? now lives, in Davidson county, four miles southwestwardly from Nashville, in making a cellar. These bones were of extraordinary  size. The under jaw bones of one skeleton was very easily slipped? over the jaw unclear unclear, a stout? man, full fleshed, very robust & considerably over the common size. These bones were dug up within the traces of ancient walls, in the form of a square if two or three hundred yards in length, situated near an excellent, never failing spring of pure & well tasted water. The spring was enclosed within the wall. A great number of skeletons was found within the enclosure,","df149b562da71132b39ccbb42fb02c8b.jpg"],[72073,"which enclosed a skeleton, placed on its feet in an\nerect posture. The scull was large enough to go over the\nhead of a man of common size.

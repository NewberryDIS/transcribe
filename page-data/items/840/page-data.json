I have finished and completed the purchase of Deer & Ship Islands for 1700 Ps?. The original title in favor of Caminada is in my possession and the property made over to me by an act passed in a Notary's Office Independent of the original title, wch I have had recorded in the Recorders office, I have taken out of the Spanish book or Register of Grants, a copy of the minutes of this Grant in favor of Caminada. In short I have shewn the titles to some lawyers, who all agree that no grant can be better cimented. --This affair & Clark's unpaid note of 1000. C. has left me without the necessary funds to carry his survey into effect -- however it must be done at somehow or other. -- Now I think we may consider ourselves in the number of the rich proprietors of this Territory. Add to this that I have just received a letter from my Brother that is settled in London who congratulates me on my land speculation, as in a conversation with Munroe he learned that our Florida","2f28f4f78db5783cfa4195dcd368a40c.jpg"],[54727,"land purchases must and would be valid. -- \nObserve that for your share of the two islands you must, on the first of May next, have here at my disposal 850 Dols. wch is half of purchase money. -- If you think that of late I have as usual, (according to you), been talking, and talking of doing this, that & tother, and after all let every thing slip thro my fingers, let me know. -- I am damnably in want of money, and think I can get 10,000 Ps? for 1/4 in Ship island. -- What do you think of this? -- Would if be proper or not to dispose of 1/4, and run no risks? -- The following is a copy of the original grant.  \"Dr. Bernardo \"Galvez &c.

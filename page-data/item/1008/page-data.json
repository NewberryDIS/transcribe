The saw mill from which all lumber for building purposes is necessarily furnished is now about thirty miles from the Post - as suitable logs can be found no nearer and this scarcity of timber with the transportation of other materials makes building very expensive.  I do not consider the position of the Post a good one for defense against either a civilized or savage enemy; it is low, almost surrounded by hills or higher ground with many ravines small streams bordered by dense thickets and similar coverings in its immediate vicinity.  To me the water (an unusually large spring with Wild Horse and other creeks) seems to have been the principal if not only natural advantage considered in selecting the site.  The Post is located near the center of the Chickasaw Nation the citizens of which are represented as quiet and peaceable getting along well among themselves and with no trouble requiring military surveillance or aid provided their western border can be protected from the marauding parties of the less civilized and troublesome tribes.

The old log buildings at that post can be repainted so as to comfortably accommodate four companies with their officers the storehouse too should be completed and if practicable shelter provided for the horses of one or two companies of cavalry. But I do not deem it advisable from any point of view to erect any new buildings at Fort Arbuckle or permanently increase the garrison of the post beyond four companies.  I have already expressed my belief in the expediency of establishing a new military post in this territory West of Fort Arbuckle.

This point is eighteen miles North and forty-six (46) miles West from Fort Arbuckle - the shortest practicable route between being about fifty (50) miles.  I think this hardly far enough from Arbuckle.  The Spring is a very fine one, located in the midst of an extensive open prairie.  There is neither timber nor stone fit for building within several miles and very little wood even fit for fuel near the spring.  A thorough examination of the country in the vicinity of this Prairie Spring convinced me that it was not a desirable location for a Post.  Farther West, however, at a point eight (8) miles North and seventy (70) miles West from Fort Arbuckle the most practicable route being about seventy five (75) miles I found what I consider on the whole the best location for a military post in the South-Western portion of this territory.  It is a tract of high level prairie land containing about two hundred acres -  situated just at the base of the range of hills which are the Eastern extremity of the Witchita Mountains.  Mount Scott the highest peak of the Witchita is about eight miles West-North-West; a perpendicular cliff of Traprock Known by the Indians as The Medicine Bluff is a mile and a half West by No.; immediately West of the plateau and fifteen feet lower than it crossed out words: and between it and the bluff are three or four hundred"},{"pageid":66579,"pagefilename":"ead88655307103e9c6fa1cf789f2d987.jpg","transcription":"acres of level prairie land.

From it’s commanding position it is well secured against surprise and is by nature one of the most defensible places I have seen.”  I believe that a force of four or six companies of cavalry at this point would be more effective than if stationed in any other locality I have visited and would give security at the same time to Northern Texas, the Chickasaws, the Caddos, Witchita and other friendly Indians who in this territory are endeavoring to remain quiet and peaceable - as all points where trouble is likely to occur can readily be reached by mounted troops placed here.

The whole valley of the Washita River for a distance of twenty miles is now commonly called Fort Cobb.  The ruins of the old post itself are however several miles farther up the river than any of the Indian villages, agencies or trading posts and I could not find anyone except Indians who had ever been there. It was represented to me as an almost barren prairie, a region destitute of wood, water, grass, etc, and I was consequently surprised when on visiting the place July 1st.

The valley of the Washita River from a point five miles below Fort Cobb to some distance this side of the Chickasaw line is wide and apparently fertile but has no good water in it.  It is in that section that Colonel Leavenworth established his Agency for the Comanche and Kiowa tribes and Major Shanklin has also gathered his Indians there, the Witchitas, Waco’s, Tomoccaroes, Ke.

The Comanche tribe, although really one people, is divided into several bands quite different in their habits and character.  The largest band, called Ouah-a-dc-de-chatz-Ken-na.

They are now tending small patches of corn at Cottonwood Grove.

These bands claim and I believe justly that while they remain quiet and peaceable upon the lands allotted to them and fulfill in everyway the requirements of their treaties the government is bound to protect them from the depredations of the wild tribes.  The same Indians complain that the Agents neglect them and give the main portion of the presents and supplies to the less worthy faithless band and I am satisfied that such is the fact.

Leavenworth encouraged the wilder Indians in their marauding by secretly giving large presents to obtain the captive children whom he nominally demanded  - and by increasing the supplies whenever they threatened him or his goods.

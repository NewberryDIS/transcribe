It was then understood that we were to have small amounts deducted from our pay each payday until the said clothing was paid for in full. This was rather limiting the spending the money of the boys.

Another reason is because the regiment has some of the best young men in the different counties where it was raised and certain other young men who remain at home hating themselves because public opinion scorns them for their cowardice or want of patriotism desire to run down its regiment as much as possible and show that we are all an immoral set of rascals.

The boys all seem to be fond of it and roam the country in search of it. Yesterday I went out two or three miles and of course stopped at every house to inquire for Sorghum. The answer which I would get would sometimes be- \"We had'nt got but a few, didnt raise many this year,\" or else \"we hadnt got but a few made a [pourer?] and sold right smart.\" \"Right smart chance\" is a favorite phrase with old Missourians. In fact two things will convince me that a man is a Missourian to see him have butternut clothes on and hear him say \"Right smart\".

It is supposed that they have gone up the Yazoo. The pioneer brigade (200 whites &amp; 499 blacks) has also gone up Steeles division constitutes the only troop now here. We expect soon to be on the move. But of course we may be disapointed. There may be no attack upon the place for weeks; but matters indicate a speedy movement.

Since we came to this place we have been without cavalry and the picket duty has been done entirely by infantry. The pickets are stationed about a quarter of a mile and on each road. Not having tents for the Regt. the different companies were scattered about in the houses of the village. Yesterday [illegible]  of [illegible] our teams with a small escort started out on the road leading to the river and as they were on the front of passing our pickets they were fired upon and immediately a body of rebel Cavalry made their appearance in sight of the village.

Maj Bardsly getting almost [illegible] ordered Cos N.B. forward as skirmishers and the remainder of Regt without orders advanced and commenced [illegible] a fire into the woods where the enemy were stationed. We were well covered by a little ditch and the enemy by the woods. Two of our companies had taken possession of the stockade, but a few shots from the enemy's 12 pounder made that a very dangerous position. Here opposite Co'B comes a hundred Cavalry on a charge. They are permitted to get very near and then a volley dismounts four or five and the remainder seek safety in flight. We are now ordered to move to one edge of town and then towards Huntsville. Yes, retreat! As yet the enemy had shown but one piece of artillery and no one dreamed of retreat without a fight which should decide whether we could hold the place.

All feel that such a retreat will disgrace us. We fall back four miles when a hold is ordered and an advance upon the town is insisted upon by officers and men. We move forward towards the village and after a slight skirmish with the enemys rear guard we are again in possession of the town. But the depot is burned, all of our papers are destroyed and property stolen or burned. Officers valises and clothing, mens knapsacks, and everything except what we wear upon our backs is appropriated to the use of the rebels or destroyed to justify their love of revenge and destruction. It was perhaps well that we retreated, but no military [illegible] [surrender?] can be justified in evacuating a fort until he knows Gorgas did of the strength of the [enemy?].

Parker.\nThe Mohawks, Onondagas, Seneeas, and our children, (the Oneidas Cayugas + Tuscaroras) have assembled here today, to listen to the Repetition of the will of the Great Spirit as communicated to us through his, Great Prhophet, handsome Lake, Gar,nyo, di yoh.  We would therefore give you all a hearty welcome. \nThe day is far advanced, and the sun is now going down. I  will therefore proceed immediately to the performance of my teaching? , Bretheren, turn your minds to the Great Spirit, and listen with good + strict attention. First, I  want all young + old to know how long ago it was since the Great Spirit communicated his religion to us, 46 years ago He spoke to the Indians through his Great Prophet, and since that time we have attempted to live faithful--\nGar nyo di yoh, told us that he lay sick four years. He says I had resigned myself to the determination of the Great Spirit, thanked the Great Spirit for every ray of light which entered my cabin, preceding? from the daily Sun. In the morning, I thought on the future, I expected not to behold the dusk of evening. I was more faithful, therefore in the discharge of my daily duties. But Evening came, and I saw--struck out through the opening in the roof of my cabin I saw the stars which the Great Spirit had made to serve as ornaments in the heavens. Again I returned my grateful thanks to my Creator, and again resigned myself to Him, expecting not to behold the lights of another morning. In this manner his sickness was prolonged. At one time, however, very early in the morning he says he told his daughter to inform his friends and relatives to come and see him once more, as the sensatory? in him, predicted that something extraordinary was to befall him.  But when the friends convened, he was dead. A small spot directly over the heart was discovered to be warm. At 9 o'clock he opened his eyes, + was asked if he saw aught. But he Could not Speak, and again closed his eyes. At noon he again opened his eyes, and was asked? by one near, if he could see"},{"pageid":61707,"pagefilename":"ba077f63f431cbf93edbd00a0f231d61.jpg","transcription":"aught He replied in the affirmative. He then was asked what he saw. He replied as follows. This morning a man came into my cabin, and wished me to follow him out of doors. I did but not feel strong enough to do so. But I arose to go out; at the door I stumbled and fell. Thric more Waquting? at the door caught me in their arms. They said we have come to help you, Haste + eat of the fruit of these branches. Each holding a branch, in his hand bearing different kinds of fruits if different colors. The men were clothed in pino white. They said that they were sent by the Great Spirit. At different insert ? it has pleased the Great Spirit to make known his will to his people, through men, but they have all proved unfaithful. He expects you to be faithful, He has heard your prayers, and has received your thanks for the preservation of your life. His mind is that you shall yet live among your people many days, To morrow your people must Convene in meeting & have a religious dance, and at noon you must go in with them. \nThe people did and they were directed. At noon he entered the Council room & looked upon his friends. \nHe then went on to tell the Council what the men in white had told him to say to the Council. He said the men spoke to me saying, tell your people the will of the Great Spirit. They have sinned a great sin + have transgresed greatly against his laws. You sin greatly in getting drunk.  The spirtuous liquors was not made for the Indians, and it will ruin them, if they continue to use it-------.  Repent, that you may escape the penalty. Strong drink was made for the white people, They are laboring men, and they want some stimulant, therefore the Creator gave them Alcohol, to drink three times a day. But they also have broken the laws given to them by their Creator----- In introducing this drink among the Indians, they have committed a great sin, and will never get to heaven. Tell your people all. Travel among them and be yourself a temperate man, Tell your people that they have committed four great sins. The Great Spirit desires them to be meek and humble in Spirit. Too many of them are proud + haughty.  Repent therefore and escape the penalty. Repent in open Council. If they cannot, they may speak to you alone (the prosh? saying I repent. We (the angels) will hear + forgive. We have always been the guardians of earth and its people since the creation, And if they Cannot speak to you, let them form the resolution? in the mind that they repent, + they shall see the Great Spirit."},{"pageid":61708,"pagefilename":"69c90618d51da61e6a6c4dcf98209734.jpg","transcription":"The Great Spirit did not design when he formed man + woman, that woman should be barren. To deprive themselves of the generative organs is a great sin. Repent of this evil among you. Some women come into the world barren. In order therefore for her to fill the position which was designed for her, she must adopt a child and love it as though her own. One doing this, shall see the Great Spirit. Also she may adopt orphans, and bring them up in virtuous principles. This also is good in the mind of the Great Spirit. If you tie up the clothes of an orphan child, the Great Spirit will notice it + reward you for it. Universal benevolence is good. The Great Spirit designed that when a man and woman should marry, they should love one another. It is wrong therefore to use \"Gnoh ate.\" (This probably corresponds with what is termed by the English coquettry - The Indians say this substance has such a charming power, that the person under its influence cannot separate himself from the charmer. It cannot safely safely be termed love, for sometimes the parties hate one another to such a degree as to be forced to come to blows, + yet the person charmed cares nothing about it.) This practice he says is ruinous?, repent and use it no more. It is the will of the Great Spirit that husband and wife shall love one another -- If they are blessed with Children, when they become of a proper age they must be married to an old experienced person. If they in turn be blessed with a child, let them unite in offering their thanks to the Great Spirit, When they have grand children they must be more thankful, for they cannot make their gratitude too manifest. It is not right when a young woman becomes pregnant, to circulate false stories concerning her and her husband,  for in doing, it may cause a separation. This is a great sin in the mind of the Great Spirit -- Should a man leave two ? such circumstances, a great punishment awaits him In this thing the old people did right. But the Great Spirit wished to renew old things. Parents, teach your children virtuous principles, You all know how great trouble it was to bring up your children, therefore teach them to walk in the paths of virtue. Children, obey your parents -- If you do not willingly submit to the will + requirements of your parents, you will cause them to feel bad + cause them to shed many tears. Disobedient Children are sent to hell. It is the will of the Great Spirit, that those children, who disobey their parents, should repent? and disobey them no more. It is wrong for a father or mother in Law to vex a son or daughter in Law. But they must also use them as if they were their own children -- When a child is loved"},{"pageid":61709,"pagefilename":"167248712fcfec01494969ee45afded0.jpg","transcription":"it is wrong for the father + mother of it, to hold disputes and bitter contentions over its body. The child hears and understands all that is said, and it often fiels bad, and will, imlify? the parents put an end to their disputes + contentions, return to the home in the bosom of the Great Spirit -- It is the will of the Great Spirit that parents should exercise love towards their children -- The Great Spirit says that adultery is a great sin, therefore he says do not commit adultery. The Great Spirit says it is great wrong to whip children with the rod. If you wish to correct a Child, use cold water. Tell them, I shall either sprinkle or plunge you. If the child says, I shall do better, there Stop. It has been the custom among the Indians to mourn for the dead one year. This practice is not right. It causes the death of many children, therefore do it no longer. Ten days mourn for the dead + no more (It is the practice among the old Indians to this day, that--struck out upon the tenth day to call together the friends of the deceased + then make a public dispersal for the effects of the deceased.) When a person is dead, it is right to make a speech over the body, telling how much you loved the deceased -- Great Respect for the dead among the Indians must be observed. To be a tattler or tale bearer is very wrong. It is the cause of great evil. Repent and do it no more. To prove the position that alcohol is ruinous we would say. Many drunkards no ? to freeze, to get drowned + to be burned to death. A great many fights arise from drunkeness -- This is what Garnyodiyoh? used to tell us, and all has indeed happened according to his word. Chiefs, warriors, women and children continue to listen, Leave alcohol + be a special people of the Great Spirit -- We once more say to you all touch not the fire water -- Many are imprudent, violating the laws of health, and thus die before their time. This again is wrong. You will do well to fill the number of your days. The Indians were once in a great darkness; but have now come to the light. We think that the great prevailing sin? among the Indians is drunkenes, and we want to say all we can to ? insert phrase above line? in regard to it. Rum sellers have no flesh on their hands. They have nothing but bones. We entreat you, warriors, that you none of you sell the fir water. Jimmy Johnson here observes, that he believes his religion to be true, and says? I shall always adhere to it as the only true religion for me ---------"},{"pageid":61710,"pagefilename":"3a1b46fabc95598680461b687e7202ab.jpg","transcription":"Jimmy Johnsonproceeds exhorting the indians to be moral.

Told the Prophet  to tell the  indians that it was very to sell any of the lands that the Great Spirit had made & given to the indians for their occupancy.  The Great Spirit, he says, did not make it for to be the property of the old people but for the ((possession?)) of the children Indians who persist in selling lands must  expect to meet a  great punishment after death. The Prophet used to tell us that none of his expeditions into the upper regions he chanced  to meet his friend,  ((Ho,neh,ya,was?)) Otherwise called ((Farmers?)) Brothers drawing sand. He said that from a great heap of sand his friend was taking a grain of sand at a time and  although he laboured continually yet the heap of sand increased as much as it decreased ((unknown))  he said would be  the punishment  of those whom are constantly selling lands. Like Farmers Brothers ((although?)) Cooking ((incessantly?)) At the heap of sand yet he could not diminish its proportions  so the indians who sells land although he might sell continually yet he never could dispose of all  the lands.

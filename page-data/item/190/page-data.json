I have a very comfortable room adjoining the parlor about as large as your sitting-room fronting the garden and road. This I occupy a great deal when it is warm enough to sit without a fire. 'Tis quite a pleasant situation. The house stands back from the road about half as far as yours does and they have a very nice yard and gardens I think - It has had about 7 years cultivation. The yard in front of the house is green and full of little shade trees and some large ones two quite large pines (The two boys are laying on the ground under one of them now, several large cherry-trees now in full bloom large as yours at La Porte. Some little peach plum and pear trees also in bloom - some small spruces and pines large and small silver-leaf, and mountain ash trees and on one side a rather neglected hedge of arborvita There is a gravel walk down to the gate and borders of flowers on each side no great variety however, but round about"},{"pageid":43676,"pagefilename":"e448b26f51d847ac858226165c06561d.jpg","transcription":"in the yard is some most splendid speciments of shrubbery I wish they were in your yard or some just like them.

I want you should have just such a nice garden, and you might have had by this time if they had taken any kind of care of it. Its a shame is'nt it! I suppose Mr. Bailey is raising a great deal of his fruit and vegatables for market in Chicago. He says he thinks 'Twill be more profitable than raising grain, and he thinks some of turning his whole farm into a garden and orchard You know I like every-thing that grows so I shall enjoy the garden the garden any how and I shall make the most of all other sources of enjoyment - Miss Jennie Bailey has an excellent piano and she plays and sings a great deal and very well. This I enjoy of course and she has kindly offered me the free use of her piano whenever I wish to practice and to assist me to, if I wish. I intend to avail myself of the opportunity what time I can spare, Then they have several horses and they ride horse back a great deal. I've rode once. Jennie & Mary Murray rode this morning. They ride very often and go like the wind on colts or any thing else - I had to have an old stump tailed madam, the mother of a dozen or two colts, saddled for me 'cause I'm inexperienced you know, and I could'nt fall off her because she was so broad in the flanks. I've had two or three buggy rides also, last Sabbath I went with Mr. Bailey, son and daughter about 10 or 12 miles to attend a meeting but was to late for the services - but the ride was very pleasant.

Mr Lincoln announcing the authoress as before and sung by the choir splendidly to the music of \"Marcia\" commencing \"If on a quiet sea\" &c then the Benediction by Rev Mr. Smith. The procession commenced forming immediately headed by the President and Chief Marshall followed by Mr and Mrs Smith then the other ministers x wives invited guests &c. I was one of the committee on the tables in the vestry, so I ran down stairs to get in to the vestry first - but just as I got down I met Mr & Mrs Smith at the church door and Mr. Smith grasped my hand and said \"My dear Mary Anne (you know they used to call me so when I was a child) I feel as if I most want to kiss youÂ !\" \"Well you may\" I replied, so he bent down his aged head and gave me a real nice kiss there right before the whole - and Mrs. Smith also, and I felt that those Kisses repaid me for all my efforts for their pleasant reception. When I think of it in the future you know. The tables in the vestry were bountifully supplied with nice eatables and adorned with boquets of flowers - my silver cake basket filled with every variety of cake, and my large glass preserve dish filled with peaches was on the table No. 1 for the ministers & invited guests. Hasnt it had an honorable dedication After the Collation we went back into the church for little extempore speeches and singing - and closed up with \"When shall we meet again\" and Old Hundred. Mr Smith said he never felt so near heaven as on that day and we all thought - amen - Now I've only one line more to tell you that we are all well as usual Rhoda has a bad cold - Samuel & Maria have a little infant daughter a week old.

I knew a family of your name there, years ago\nScipioville Cayuga Co N. Y.  Sept 18th 1866\nMiss C. H. Everett,\nDr madam, Yours of the 15th inst. is just received, and, having wrote you in regard to the needlecase, I willingly answer both letters, as it was with this intuition that I wrote my communication to you, in regard to both letter and needlecase. Perhaps, it may be a disappointment to you to know that your needlecase fell into the hand of a Chaplain in the Army, instead of one in the ranks, but, its history in either case is not lost, though, perhaps more interesting had it come in possession of the latter\nI suppose it is generally thought, that Officers in the Army were able to have, and in fact had, all their need supplied, this supposition, no doubt arose from the fact that their pay was more than that of a private. So far as pay is concerned they did have more per month than those in the ranks, but, alas for both Officer and private! the contingencies of war often brought them both as a level point of want, and both have had to be companions in tribulation frequently, though the one might have had a higher salary than the other. \nIn consequence of this I have seen Officers looking much worse in appearance than those under them, and so far as food was concerned those in the ranks would have their rations while the Officers would have none; simply because the government had not paid the latter, while they were obliged to furnish food to the former. This however was not always the case, as both have been brought into circumstances when food & clothing was insufficient, because supplies were"},{"pageid":22810,"pagefilename":"8e6f368052c49cab2d065c253de9b6a1.jpg","transcription":"delayed. So far as I am concerned, I may say, that, when I came to Richmond, after having marched from Deep Bottom, to Hatchers Run, and from thence to before Petersburgh on the 2nd Apl? 1865, as well as having followed Gen Lee to Appomattux C.H., where he surrendered-- I was as ragged as a man ought to be, not because I had no means, (as Government owed me) but because I could not get it, This is the reason that the Chaplain Commission gave me your needle case, I could not purchase, the contents of such an article, for want of pay, and, the Commission kindly dealt out to me, that which might have been really intended for a more honorable recipient, Nevertheless, it was as duly appreciated by me, being in the employ of the government, though a Chaplain, as it would have been by the bravest and most worthy soldier in the army; therefore you may say to the \"Ladie's Aid Society of Steuben, Oneida Co, N, Y. that your needle case came safe to hand, to one who needed such an article; and to one who was most deeply interested in the well being and well doing of our soldiers, not forgetting an interest in the final triumph of our cause.\nSo far as I now remember, I distributed, among our soldiers, quite a number of articles sent by the \"aid Society, of Steuben\" and the \"Society\" may rest assured that the thanks of our boys were deeply felt, though you may not have heard yet from them, either by word or letter,\nThe fact, that these things were received, after the surrender of Lee, and while at Richmond, does not lessen the gratitude of those who shared in your benevolence, and for this reason-- that, though, the same? could have been had in the city, yet"},{"pageid":22811,"pagefilename":"510ae7f44d776a581e31164c53577e5b.jpg","transcription":"the means were wanting to obtain them, as, most of the soldiers had had no pay for months previous to the reception of your gift.\nI hope you will not be sorry that your charity found such a subject, if so I can only say that I am glad, as I have the article in question as a memento of benevolence of friends to the soldiers, making it personal through its bestowment by yourself.\nNow, then, having disposed of the gift and somewhat so of the recipient, permit me to notice a few things in yours, which, though it may have been intended for another than a \"Chaplain\", yet, done the one in such a capacity - as much good, perhaps, as though another than a minister had received it.  You may have forgotten what you wrote but, it is before me; it reads as follows, \"I have just been reading the 4th Chap of Colossians, and was so impressed with the 13th verse that I feel constrained to write it for you.  It is this \"I can do all things through Christ which strenghteneth me\". From this assertion, (as I suppose you endorse the truth) I take you to be a christian.  I do not say an Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, or of any other sect or party but, simply a christian, not that any? or either of these should be discarded if honestly adhered to, but, I think you are, or wish to be numbered with those who believe the word of God to feel called upon to live a life of faith in the son of God.  If this is so as I do not doubt, then you must believe the quotation or passage above given in Colossians, Premising that you consent, with all your heart to the sentiment, as well as truthfulness of that passage, may I ask, if you can be made, or, make yourself holy now, through Christ!  If you hesitate & begin to make excuses, I fear there is a lack of faith on your part, and you let unbelief rob you of trying to see what you can do through Christ!!

Do you doubt?\nIf so, may the good Lord help you to accept the same passage from me, which you, in your faith intended for some body, whether Chaplain or unclear it makes but little difference as all must come up to the standard of God’s moral excellence or be found wanting!\n\n   Do you say this may take place at death only? I have only to say that death is ever present and, what God demands and what may be done through Christ, as to meeting\n\nanunclear “all things” as a preparation for heaven, may be done now as well as at any other time, for now is the accepted time, behold!, to day is the day of salvation.\n\n   Pardon me my good sister-- for such I take you to be, if I am somewhat earnest in my epistle. I feel as though every body ought to believe the Word of God; consequently when I hear or see a quotation from it as giving to others an exhortation to duty in believing that portion which is particularly specified, I feel constrained to ascertain whether, the writer or speaker has faith in the assertion made, or not.\n   Do not mistake me, as thinking you a delinquent in this, I only mean to incite yourself as well as myself to a fuller belief in “every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God”--\n   On receit of an answer to this I will, God willing, write again.

POOLER will conduct the Class Drill.\nHon. E.W. KEYES, Acting State Superintendent ; Professor D.H. COCHRANE, Principal State Normal School ; President FISHER, and many other distinguished gentlemen, are expected to lecture before the Institute.\nWe would upon all Teachers, and those intending to teach a Common School, the importance of attending the Institute. Those having had the experience cannot fail to be benefited by an intercourse and acquaintance with each other, and by discussion of their various methods of teaching and governing. Those without experience and intending to teach, certainly need to avail themselves of every opportunity to qualify themselves for the responsibilities they are about to assume. Our Doctors, Lawyers and Divines spend years in thought and study to prepare themselves to practice successfully in their professions, yet none of these need a more thorough preparation before entering upon practice than the Teacher. The duty which binds every Teacher to elevate his profession - the sacred obligations we are all under to improve that sacred and hereditary institution, our Common School system - the momentous interests, both public and private, which depend upon the advancement of popular education amongst us - the blessing or the calamities to be bestowed or inflicted upon all posterity by our fidelity or our neglect - appeal to every Teacher in particular to promote every measure and embrace every opportunity which holds out a reasonable expectation of enhancing the prosperity and extending the blessing of our Common Schools. Had a similar Common School system to that of our own State existed in every State of our Union, that the whole people could have read and understood their own true interests, that awful calamity that now threatens to overwhelm us as a nation could never have happened.\nAs only such Teachers as attend the entire term can be reported as a basis upon which to draw from the funds granted by the State, we hope all Teachers may be present and report themselves on the first day of the meeting. It will be well for each Teacher to bring an Arithmetic, a Grammar, and if convenient, Sanders' Fifth Reader.\nDated at Utica, the 2nd day of September, 1861.\nH.E. WILCOX, \nP.B. CRANDALL,\nJ.H.

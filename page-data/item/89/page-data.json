So far as pay is concerned they did have more per month than those in the ranks,  but, alas for both Officer and private! The contingencies of war often brought them both as a level  point of wants and both have had to be companions in  tribulation frequently, though the one might have had a higher salary than the other. \nIn consequence of this I have seen Officers looking much worse in appearance than those under them, and so far as food was concerned those in the ranks would have their rations while the Officers would have none; simply because the government had not paid the latter, while they were obliged to furnish food to the former, this however was not always the case, as both have been brought into circumstances when food & clothing was insufficient, because supplies were de-"},{"pageid":22810,"pagefilename":"8e6f368052c49cab2d065c253de9b6a1.jpg","transcription":"layed.

I feel as though every body ought to believe the Word of God; consequently when I hear or see a quotation unclear as giving to others an exhortation to duty in believing that portion which is particularly specified, I feel constrained to ascertain whether, the writer or speaker has faith in the assertion made, or not.\n   Do not mistake me, as thinking you a delinquent in this, I only mean to incite yourself as well as myself to a fuller belief in “every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God”\n   On receit of an answer to this I will, God willing. write again.

Those having had the experience cannot fail to be benefited by an intercourse and acquaintance with each other, and by discussion of their various methods of teaching and governing. Those without experience and intending to teach, certainly need to avail themselves of every opportunity to qualify themselves for the responsibilities they are about to assume. Our Doctors, Lawyers and Divines spend years in thought and study to prepare themselves to practice successfully in their professions, yet none of these need a more thorough preparation before entering upon practice than the Teacher. The duty which binds every Teacher to elevate his profession - the sacred obligations we are all under to improve that sacred and hereditary institution, our Common School system - the momentous interests, both public and private, which depend upon the advancement of popular education amongst us - the blessing or the calamities to be bestowed or inflicted upon all posterity by our fidelity or our neglect - appeal to every Teacher in particular to promote every measure and embrace every opportunity which holds out a reasonable expectation of enhancing the prosperity and extending the blessing of our Common Schools. Had a similar Common School system to that of our own State existed in every State of our Union, that the whole people could have read and understood their own true interests, that awful calamity that now threatens to overwhelm us as a nation could never have happened.\nAs only such Teachers as attend the entire term can be reported as a basis upon which to draw from the funds granted by the State, we hope all Teachers may be present and report themselves on the first day of the meeting. It will be well for each Teacher to bring an Arithmetic, a Grammar, and if convenient, Sanders' Fifth Reader.\nDated at Utica, the 2nd day of September, 1861.\nH.E. WILCOX, \nP.B. CRANDALL,\nJ.H.

Everett\nWe, the undersigned, Commissioners of Schools for the County of Oneida, earnestly solicit your attendance at the TEACHERS' INSTITUTE, to be held in the Court-House at Rome, in pursuance of Chapter 179, Laws of 1856, to commence on Monday, September 30, at 2 o'clock P.M., and to continue two weeks - five days in each week. \nArrangements have been made that Board can be had reasonable.\nProfessor C.T. POOLER will conduct the Class Drill.\nHon. E.W. KEYES, Acting State Superintendent ; Professor D.H. COCHRANE, Principal State Normal School ; President FISHER, and many other distinguished gentlemen, are expected to lecture before the Institute.\nWe would upon all Teachers, and those intending to teach a Common School, the importance of attending the Institute. Those having had the experience cannot fail to be benefited by an intercourse and acquaintance with each other, and by discussion of their various methods of teaching and governing. Those without experience and intending to teach, certainly need to avail themselves of every opportunity to qualify themselves for the responsibilities they are about to assume. Our Doctors, Lawyers and Divines spend years in thought and study to prepare themselves to practice successfully in their professions, yet none of these need a more thorough preparation before entering upon practice than the Teacher. The duty which binds every Teacher to elevate his profession - the sacred obligations we are all under to improve that sacred and hereditary institution, our Common School system - the momentous interests, both public and private, which depend upon the advancement of popular education amongst us - the blessing or the calamities to be bestowed or inflicted upon all posterity by our fidelity or our neglect - appeal to every Teacher in particular to promote every measure and embrace every opportunity which holds out a reasonable expectation of enhancing the prosperity and extending the blessing of our Common Schools. Had a similar Common School system to that of our own State existed in every State of our Union, that the whole people could have read and understood their own true interests, that awful calamity that now threatens to overwhelm us as a nation could never have happened.\nAs only such Teachers as attend the entire term can be reported as a basis upon which to draw from the funds granted by the State, we hope all Teachers may be present and report themselves on the first day of the meeting. It will be well for each Teacher to bring an Arithmetic, a Grammar, and if convenient, Sanders' Fifth Reader.\nDated at Utica, the 2nd day of September, 1861.\nH.E. WILCOX, \nP.B. CRANDALL,\nJ.H. TRACY,\nM.N. CAPRON,\nSCHOOL COMMISSIONERS FOR THE CO. OF ONEIDA.\nD.S.

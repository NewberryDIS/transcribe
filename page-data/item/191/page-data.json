Be assured I have not forgotten my promise. I will not wait longer, this Susan is away and I cannot, therefore, say much of special interest.

Mr Conant, too, had had affliction in his family his head clerk,  a relative, about 21 years of age, has died at his house after only 10 days of sickness- and during his illness Mrs Conant (Mr. Wales' only sister) was taken sick, and has been, and is, dangerously ill.

I had mentioned to L. the subject of our conversation, and she said she only knew of shirt making and thin coat making, such as Mr. Wales had done for the store. It is not very profitable of course. She said she wished she could offer you a home for months, free from any board charge, and did not like the thought of your coming to board but I told her that it was only right and that you would prefer to do so, if you came for three or 4 months. But she is away now, and says every thing seems unsettled. I want her to be at home again and to know that they are both well. We dreaded to have the baby taken out. I think I shall return to Warwick and pass a few weeks, while Abby is sick, I am quite disappointed that she has not written to me, I have heard nothing since I left her. If I do go again to W.

We were quite disapointed to hear that Mr. Bancroft, asked so much for his place, if he had offered it for two thousand dollars Sumner would have come up and looked at it, and no doubt would have bought it, three thousand dollars is a great price for his place so far in the country that would purchase quite a nice place near Boston. What did Mary mean when she said in her letter that she was glad to hear that we had made up our minds to come to Warwick to live. (I do not see much prospect of it as yet) I supose you would like to hear about the Cousins; they are all well as far as I know, Abbie Lamb's folks live in Boston this winter, she has been over here once this winter, and Agnes, has been here once, she is teaching school in Boston as usual. Fannie Stewart has been down and staid a fortnight with me and a very pleasant visit we had together.

Holyoke Seminary, Feb. 27 '49 (49 probably 50)\nDear sister Elizabeth:\nI am sitting in my little room all alone, this bright lovely morning. The full orbed moon moving in solitude, accompanied by but one gently star, is sending her pure beams through the window. The snow is almost entirely gone and nature seems to be striving to put on her green robe once more. Our morning walks now are delightful, the cold storms have passed, and we no longer fear, if we slacken our pace a little, freezing shall be the penalty. I wish you could partake of these pleasures with me. But, oh! cain wish be silent. Last week two of my friends, that I have found since coming here, were invited by their sister. She is teaching in a young ladies seminary and came to [pass?] her vacation with her sisters. They were indeed happy in her society from wednesday until monday morn, I tried not terry them. I became a little acquainted with her, it was very pleasant to see some one once more from the busy world, and learn a little of the news of the day. I should love to have you come and see the school, it would be quite a curiosity to see how every thing is managed in this great family. There are quite a member sick now, one is  considered quite dangerous, her mother came here night before last. Almost all of us are more or less troubled with colds. Harriet and Alice have both had to leave this to go to breakfast and the room-work, extra-work, and domestic-work have so occupied my time that I have not touched this more until now (later in"},{"pageid":24213,"pagefilename":"6a18ccdcf29dc86d578ad0e177b5d6d3.jpg","transcription":"the afternoon). I had a very pleasant this morning, I went alone, my room-mates did not feel like going, I took father's and mother's and Eddy;s likeness (which I suppose you know they sent me in a letter) for company it seemed almost as though they were with me. I walked on lots and through the grass yard. In any walk I came to a grove with sparkling rill passing through it, this was a lovely place, on each side were steep hills which concealed the village and busy world from views here I walked some time happy with the likness, rill, and trees. Oh! I think sometimes how little did I know how to value my friends, which I was with them. This world I find is peopled by a cold and I often think deceitful race, I must thank (Harriet for all the pleasure I find in these parts, she is a dear good girl and knows how to be a sister to the lonely. You asked in your last whether she is that sister who visited Niagra Falls with her brother, George, she is not, that was Sophia, who is now dead. He  attended school last year at Lansingburg, where that young lady went, who, you remember, came to Whitestown to school a year ago last fall and left after being there only two days because she was so home sick. I feel rather discouraged in regard to my progress, it seems as though I had learned very little since I came here, what a pleasure it would be could I only talk it all over with you, pen and ink I find is too formal for such things. I cannot find any fault with the school, but time is what is wanting. Miss Whitman is I think a person of a very strong mind, and I think the main support of this school. I love my new section teacher more and more every day. She is quite young I should judge, and very sweet in her appearance. She graduated here last year, and was regarded as a very good student. I think she knows more than Miss Yale, and I love them both very"},{"pageid":24214,"pagefilename":"086e1d2205e3a2d58926ba0208dda4bd.jpg","transcription":"much indeed. Miss Chapin one of the teachers) who had gone home on account of her health, returned today after an absence of 15 weeks, I have not seen her to speak with her, she looks much better than before she left. Miss Mason, who was my section teacher when I first-came here, has left for a few weeks to regain her health. The teacher's duties here seem to be very hard. Oh, how I should love to call on you some day in my walks as I used to do at Whitestown. You can hardly know how much I want to see dear little Henry, I very often think of him and his pretty hair, I wonder whether I should know him from that if I were to see him in a stranger's arms. Many and many a sweet image have I formed of him in my mind which I have no doubt he resembles, give him a warm kiss for me, now dont forget. I am glad to hear he gives no little trouble, I think I have no great reason to fear you will spoil him by rocking. Give my best love to Mr. and Mrs. Butler and tell them I often wish myself in their quiet kitchen enjoying a pleasant chat with them I have tried to obey Mrs. Butlers advice about being good, but I find it is not so easily done as I used to think for. How is Brother B's health now? does his school prosper? did the sickness there prove a serious injury to it? Who do they expect to get to assist him next year? Is your health pretty good? I must close now or I shall leave no room or time for Mary. I hope she does not think I have forgotten her part. Let me hear from you soon. It seems a long time since I had a letter.

How do you enjoy yourself nowdays. When have you seen Hatty Hull last? give my love to her. Is Mr. Heffron's sister with him now? How is Mrs. H's now? When have you seen the Chaney girls? are they pretty much recovered? Anne Gates and I wrote a letter to them last week, Give my love to them, if you see them, and tell them we think it is time for them to answer it, we dont like to wait a great while for a letter any more than other people. When have you heard from cousin Elizabeth? has she recovered? I was very glad that you wrote in E. J. R's letter. The news was very unexpected indeed, it does not mean that I shall never more see those friends. Did Mr. Moore have hopes of recovery to the last, or did he think himself about to die? Where is Miss Walton? you do not say a word about her, is she not at school? how did she bear the stroke? I heard through Anne Gates that the Stark family were all very sick, are any of them considered dangerous? How is Hannah and L.? were there any cases in the village? I have but a very few moments to write I hope you will excuse improprieties. To morrow is last day for schools and Colleges and we shall have no school. The teachers have many of them gone out to a party (as it is called) this evening. It is a beautiful light evening but rather windy I received a letter from John last week with that likeness and have not answered it yet, I fear he will think I was not very thankful, but if he does he is much mistaken. I intend to write to him Saturday. Oh, you dont know how happy it makes me to have father and mother & Eddy too so near. I wish you could be with me a few moments that I might hear you speak just one word. We had very interesting experements last Saturday in chemistry. Anne Gates sends her her love to you and Elizabeth and says she thinks she is enough acquainted with Brother B, to send her respects so here you have it. Dont fail to write a long letter very soon.

I meet with all those of the middle and senior years and some of the juniors, Miss Scott leads in the meeting. We usualy find passages of scripture relating to some particular subject.

Holyoke Seminary, Feb. 27 '49 (49 probably 50)\nDear sister Elizabeth:\nI am sitting in my little room all alone, this bright lovely morning. The full orbed moon moving in solitude, accompanied by but one gently star, is sending her pure beams through the window. The snow is almost entirely gone and nature seems to be striving to put on her green robe once more. Our morning walks now are delightful, the cold storms have passed, and we no longer fear, if we slacken our pace a little, freezing shall be the penalty. I wish you could partake of these pleasures with me. But, oh! vain wish be silent. Last week two of my friends, that I have found since coming here, were invited by their sister. She is teaching in a young ladies seminary and came to [pass?] her vacation with her sisters. They were indeed happy in her society from wednesday until monday morn, I tried not to envy them. I became a little acquainted with her, it was very pleasant to see some one once more from the busy world, and learn a little of the news of the day. I should love to have you come and see the school, it would be quite a curiosity to see how every thing is managed in this great family. There are quite a number sick now, one is  considered quite dangerous, her mother came here night before last. Almost all of us are more or less troubled with colds. Harriet and Alice have both quite a hard cold, I am quite well except a little cold like\nthe rest. I have had to leave this to go to breakfast and the room-work, extra-work, and domestic-work have so occupied my time that I have not touched this more until now (late in"},{"pageid":24213,"pagefilename":"6a18ccdcf29dc86d578ad0e177b5d6d3.jpg","transcription":"the afternoon). I had a very pleasant this morning, I went alone, my room-mates did not feel like going, I took father's and mother's and Eddy;s likeness (which I suppose you know they sent me in a letter) for company it seemed almost as though they were with me. I walked on lots and through the grass yard. In any walk I came to a grove with sparkling rill passing through it, this was a lovely place, on each side were steep hills which concealed the village and busy world from views here I walked some time happy with the likness, rill, and trees. Oh! I think sometimes how little did I know how to value my friends, which I was with them. This world I find is peopled by a cold and I often think deceitful race, I must thank (Harriet for all the pleasure I find in these parts, she is a dear good girl and knows how to be a sister to the lonely. You asked in your last whether she is that sister who visited Niagra Falls with her brother, George, she is not, that was Sophia, who is now dead. He  attended school last year at Lansingburg, where that young lady went, who, you remember, came to Whitestown to school a year ago last fall and left after being there only two days because she was so home sick. I feel rather discouraged in regard to my progress, it seems as though I had learned very little since I came here, what a pleasure it would be could I only talk it all over with you, pen and ink I find is too formal for such things. I cannot find any fault with the school, but time is what is wanting. Miss Whitman is I think a person of a very strong mind, and I think the main support of this school. I love my new section teacher more and more every day. She is quite young I should judge, and very sweet in her appearance. She graduated here last year, and was regarded as a very good student. I think she knows more than Miss Yale, and I love them both very"},{"pageid":24214,"pagefilename":"086e1d2205e3a2d58926ba0208dda4bd.jpg","transcription":"much indeed. Miss Chapin one of the teachers) who had gone home on account of her health, returned today after an absence of 15 weeks, I have not seen her to speak with her, she looks much better than before she left. Miss Mason, who was my section teacher when I first-came here, has left for a few weeks to regain her health. The teacher's duties here seem to be very hard. Oh, how I should love to call on you some day in my walks as I used to do at Whitestown. You can hardly know how much I want to see dear little Henry, I very often think of him and his pretty hair, I wonder whether I should know him from that if I were to see him in a stranger's arms. Many and many a sweet image have I formed of him in my mind which I have no doubt he resembles, give him a warm kiss for me, now dont forget. I am glad to hear he gives no little trouble, I think I have no great reason to fear you will spoil him by rocking. Give my best love to Mr. and Mrs. Butler and tell them I often wish myself in their quiet kitchen enjoying a pleasant chat with them I have tried to obey Mrs. Butlers advice about being good, but I find it is not so easily done as I used to think for. How is Brother B's health now? does his school prosper? did the sickness there prove a serious injury to it? Who do they expect to get to assist him next year? Is your health pretty good? I must close now or I shall leave no room or time for Mary. I hope she does not think I have forgotten her part. Let me hear from you soon. It seems a long time since I had a letter.

How do you enjoy yourself nowdays. When have you seen Hatty Hull last? give my love to her. Is Mr. Heffron's sister with him now? How is Mrs. H's now? When have you seen the Chaney girls? are they pretty much recovered? Anne Gates and I wrote a letter to them last week, Give my love to them, if you see them, and tell them we think it is time for them to answer it, we dont like to wait a great while for a letter any more than other people. When have you heard from cousin Elizabeth? has she recovered? I was very glad that you wrote in E. J. R's letter. The news was very unexpected indeed, it does not mean that I shall never more see those friends. Did Mr. Moore have hopes of recovery to the last, or did he think himself about to die? Where is Miss Walton? you do not say a word about her, is she not at school? how did she bear the stroke? I heard through Anne Gates that the Stark family were all very sick, are any of them considered dangerous? How is Hannah and L.? were there any cases in the village? I have but a very few moments to write I hope you will excuse improprieties. To morrow is last day for schools and Colleges and we shall have no school. The teachers have many of them gone out to a party (as it is called) this evening. It is a beautiful light evening but rather windy I received a letter from John last week with that likeness and have not answered it yet, I fear he will think I was not very thankful, but if he does he is much mistaken. I intend to write to him Saturday. Oh, you dont know how happy it makes me to have father and mother & Eddy too so near. I wish you could be with me a few moments that I might hear you speak just one word. We had very interesting experements last Saturday in chemistry. Anne Gates sends her her love to you and Elizabeth and says she thinks she is enough acquainted with Brother B, to send her respects so here you have it. Dont fail to write a long letter very soon.

May 15, '58\nDear Sister: \nShall I write you a stormy letter? The sole topic of conversation and almost of thought is the storm of last Thursday. It commenced at about 2 1/2 P.M. by a most fearful hailstorm accompanied by thunder and lightning. The hailstones were from one to two inches in diameter. It was terrible to hear the crash of our windows. We have no shutters and during less than ten minutes about 150 lights, many 25' by 18', were broken. The calm after the storm was unusually peaceful. The sun looked smiling down upon the bright face of nature and seemed to whisper peace. This continued for about two hours when the lightning began to dart fearfully along the sky. Those who are accustomed to western storms say that the clouds had gathered along the western horizon, portending wind, but we saw it not. We first noticed particularly the violent bending of the tress when suddenly the rain was driven in sheets across the square in front of the Sem. so dense that we could see nothing else. The noise was so great that we distinguished \n[left half of page]\ning when quietness was again restored. - The morning brought consciousness of the danger through which we had passed and our hearts were filled with gratitude to our heavenly Father. Other places about have suffered still more than this. Peoria, a city a little east of us, is said to lie half in ruins, but I forbare to give rumors (underlined). The tornado was, I believe, not felt in Chicago, and we hope not on the lakes. I wrote home yesterday. It is more than a week since we have heard from them. They miss you for writing letters. Eddie has ceased to correspond with us. Does he ever write to you? How is Mary? Does the visit seem to improve her health? She ought not to try to do anything but get well. Do you like the East as well as at first and do you find your studies easier as you become accustomed to them. When is your vacation? How long do you expect to remain with Elizabeth? I do not quite understand whether you have entered the course or not. We are both well and unite in you all (underlined).

All is a mass of ruins, only the end walls stand of what was so lately the largest and only (underlined) beautiful church in the place. There is great sympathy felt for the church (crossed out) the society which is new and by no means wealthy. I hear they are considerably in debt for the building. The storm came from the north=west and carried the timbers of the church towards the Sem, but they did not strike. The corner of our roof was torn away and pieces of the cornice were hurled to the ground. Much of the trim was also torn from the roof. The rain and wind came in at the broken windows, hurling the broken pieces of glass in every direction and we hastened to take refuge in the south=east part of the building. The streets had become great rivers, sweeping away the fences and sidewalks. Almost every home \n[right side of page]\nin the place was more or less injured, but the brick buildings (underlined) suffered the most. One large new building, into a part of which the family had lately moved, was thrown down and the only part standing is the room in which the family were. God mercifully preserved them unhurt. Another house fell (crossed out) in which the carpenters were at work, fell:one man only was hurt, he had his arm broken. Several houses near the creek were partly fill with water.- one, not occupied at present- was carried down the stream several rods. This storm continued about three quarters of an hour and all was quiet and pleasant except for the sad marks of destruction, till after ten. We had moved our beds all on to the south side (underlined) and made ourselves comfortable for the night, when the storm again broke out, but with much less violence.

You recollect, any way I do, that I asked Mr. DuBois if he could pack them safely so that they would not break as we were going to carry them in the cars, \"O, yes\" he said, \"we will put them in a box and pack them so that there will be no danger\".

Mother and the girls like the dishes very much, especially the creamer and the sugar bowl if it was only whole. If you could would like to have you get me a net- something like Jennie's, only a little larger. Hers is rather small. If you have not got the moss already, would you not look at the little baskets, and see if you could get something pretty for the center of my wreath. Jennie thinks she saw some, where they keep the moss. Do not trouble about those little things, if it is not convenient to get them. If you see any thing else at Nyers that would be pretty in the wreath, some pretty green leaves or something so. Please procure if not too costly. Those leaves you sent are very pretty. Don't go any where but Nyers for these things, unless you wish to. I don't want you to run all over the city, and tire yourself all out before you come home. Sarah would like to have you get some cards for her- suitable for large scholars- also look at question books and get your own pleasure about getting some. She thinks there are cards with little maps on them if you find any such please get some for her. I think I saw some pretty embedded cards, ten or so in a pack, at Davies, different from any she has ever had, but I do not remember much about them- look at them and if you think best get them. If you do not feel like doing these errands now it will be as well to leave them till you go down next month. We sent $10 to you in a letter this month by Uncle- hope you have got it.

Sarah and I were at Mr. Ames' yesterday afternoon at a little party made to welcome Will and his Mary home after their marriage. We had a very pleasant time indeed - the weather was delightful, the bride and groom charming, the company bright and joyous, and the hospitality abundant. They were hoping Mr. and Mr. Annable would be there but they was not able to go up as his mother is visiting them now - Mr and Mrs Rice - the new M.E. minister at the Corners - were there however, and we found them very agreeable persons - worthy successors of Mr. and Mrs. Flint. Jim Roberts and Owen and all their sisters were there - but I believe Mary has told in Cynthia's letters who were there - What I want to tell you is that we told them we were expecting you"},{"pageid":24403,"pagefilename":"122c239530406ae6419b075307bad5db.jpg","transcription":"home next Saturday and we asked our Ames' friends and Willie's new brothers and sisters to come here next Monday evening in order to have a visit with you - we forgot to ask Pierce but will try to send him word - and we expect Lewis and Jane of course so you will have quite a company to see you and we hope you will be looking well - Cynthia too, we would like to have home too, to be companion lion to you - Our friends all asked if Cynthia would not be home too and we promised to write to ask her. Mary has done that and I here do the same - It would be so pleasant for her to come with you, but she knows best, of course. Thank you, Eddie, for taking so much trouble with those samples - they are very pretty but are not any of them quite what I need - bring me a pretty calico dress - not very dark - 10 yds or so. - This is a very warm day and - well - I'm sleepy - We are very glad Mr. P. is not going to leave. Much love from this sister Jennie"},{"pageid":24404,"pagefilename":"1c1f40c7c344a3475512d4bc604a2527.jpg","transcription":"1857\nGatesburg, Nov. 16, 1857\nDear Eddie, \nYou're a good deal better for writing when you were so \"tired\" and as I have to share you shall have your pay. Do you have to work very hard this winter? While you are about wishing, why doubt you wish we were home or at least the Remsen school, and then you could earlier have your talk. Would we not keep our life busy though, guess you would hardly grant me the same privilege as in writing. What was it with which you could easily fill your school? Have carefully examined Webster but no such word can I find as \"nuescence\" will you see if it is in the unabridged?"},{"pageid":24405,"pagefilename":"2ca86a47022c20548a0ba4b894208d5e.jpg","transcription":"In the question about me or us I intended me, you can let us read it with you but it is to be yours when it is read through. I hope the story in the \"Child's Paper\" drew your attention to some purpose and that you will make a resolution also and tell me what it is. I hope you will have an opportunity to go to school before long, but till then do not be satisfied without learning something new every day if it is ever so little. Do not look to your books as your only source. You can learn a great many things by looking about you. Watch the squirrels getting ready for winter, notice the birds and all your doves and chickens and if you learn anything new let me know. Please will you tell me in your next show these letters this afternoon. Instead of having an hour this morning as I expected the dinner bell rang, giving me but half an hour, and since then I have been busy as a bee till now and you by the means will"},{"pageid":24406,"pagefilename":"cb043209f3d99a79ed64bd9bff6a7bc6.jpg","transcription":"have to wait another day for your letter. This morning I took my second ride or rather my third since coming here. Miss Kendall, the Drawing Teacher, was sending her sister to the Universalist School and invited me to accompany them. It is little more than a mile distant in a direction quite new for me. The ground was all covered with snow and our horse, which by the way is their horse, was white as though he wore Jack Frost's mantle. I had a happy ride only I wished Anna could enjoy it too. Next Saturday we have had almost a promise of a ride. The music teachers have some friends living near, who say if possible, they will take us out then. The country about here seems very pleasant and I long to know a little more about it. We have often talked of hiring a horse and going out ourselves like Don Quixote in quest of adventures but it will be so much the pleasanter to have some one to tell us about the scenes through which we pass.

I hope pa will not sell her, I hope she will be very discreet until we go home so that I can be troubled with her for a drive. We received a present of a dish of honey, in the comb, this afternoon. We have had a nice feast and should be most happy to have invited you to partake with us. As distance will not allow this, suppose you eat one of those proud sweets and try to imagine you are eating honey with us. Think you it would be possible to make yourself, believe it? By the way, has mother got any honey? Has she made any preserves since current jelly time? We have been very desirous to gather some crab apples and preserve them to take home with us, but we have been unable to do so and now fear it is too late. Have you gathered any more nuts? We have not. It is almost bedtime, for Anna is lying on the carpet asleep"},{"pageid":24408,"pagefilename":"744c371538a81e567ecf9d40cf887245.jpg","transcription":"Sem.

Send us a note every time the others write that we may know how fast you learn. You ought to love Miss Bolegrove very much for teaching you. Are you learning to read also? You cannot write me a specimen of your reading, but I shall expect to hear some when I go home.

What do you suppose it made me think of? It was our Eddie, and how near he come to finding a nest last summer. I saw a little bird on a tree near our window this morning. It was a dark bird with such a white breast. It did not sing any. Perhaps it saw the bright, warm sun from its nest and thought it was spring, but when it came out"},{"pageid":24410,"pagefilename":"3a2f361778f870e6141e7370050bf010.jpg","transcription":"and found so much snow it was frightened.

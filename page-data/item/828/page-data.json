I don't know when I've had so many contradictory emotions about a story. Intellectually, I would not have had it end otherwise - but underneath, in my unconscious, is yet the wish that it should be the doctor. This is the first letter I've ever written an author about a book since I was a little girl; and that was  to Charles Dickens, about David Copperfield. I wish you could see our beautiful baby- thru some strange circumstance he is beautiful- came thru all finished with polished fingernails and delicate features. We're here at the Brevoort til Wednesday or Thursday + then we're going home. Faithfully B. Marie Gage Dell.

I wanted to write Red Lewis + tell him so - tell him to read it + realize how far he'd missed his mark. I don't think there's ever been a more perfectly drawn character, even, in fiction than the mother. She lived for me so completely; I understood her so well, and knowing her made me understand my own mother better.  ¶ It may amuse you to learn of my bitter disappointment that the doctor, rather than the younger lover was not the girl's final choice."},{"pageid":54253,"pagefilename":"7b6faae66e0ed3dea6cc0fd1bd6e3d19.jpg","transcription":"FH\nDear Miss Cather,\nI'll like coming Wednesday at 4.

I shall try and explain to you briefly the problem confronting me, and you can then use your own good judgment, whether it deserves or needs any attention. About twelve years ago we had our home place clear, but Father then bought this place that I am now living on with my wife and two children, for the sum of $11,500. And what hurts now is that he made the mistake of mortgaging the home place in order to secure his loan I suppose. of course we kept subtracting from the \"Principal\" each year, until there was only $7000. left, but also at the same time land went down, and father died suddenly, leaving no will. which made things very complicated for the reason that several of us children were still minors at the time, but finally after much expense, time and labor a temporary settlement was made. This farm that I am on was sold at a \"Sheriff's sale\" in front of the courthouse at Red cloud, Nebr., for the sum of $8000., and I was obliged to bid it in as nobody else bid on it. and thus it happened that I bought this place for the sum of $8000. The Principal note being $7000. but interest, taxes and court expense amounted to $1000 so that is why it had to bring $8000."},{"pageid":54255,"pagefilename":"bd461535a75198576b57d2c2692e8ce8.jpg","transcription":"If father had not II mortgaged the home place, everything would have been alright, but now that is where my trouble comes in as I am the owner and if I should attempt to let it go, they will sell it of course, and if it does not bring the before mentioned amount, they will then sell the home place to make up the balance, and then dear old Mother's place, would be no more. With this depression on, and taxes and interest as high as ever, it is impossible for me to keep on, as I just can not make it. I would be better off if I were renting the land instead of owning it. If I could only sell this place for what is against it, everything would be alright as that would release the home place and save, \"Mother's home\". It is not my idea or intention of writing you a \"Sob Story\" (underlined) but just plain truth, the way things are in their reality. When I tell you that we have economized and saved in order to pay our taxes and interest, to the extent of denying ourselves all the luxuries that our neighbors and friends are enjoying, such as dances and shows as well as keeping the home beautiful and up to date. You cannot help but believe me. where one has his farm paid for it is different as one can always make his taxes, besides a good living, but when one adds on $350 to $400 interest each year it is impossible to come out even during these depressing times. The last two years I have had to borrow money to meet my payments, but now the Banks will not loan anymore, so there is only one of two things to do., either sell it for the above amount if possible or let them foreclose and do the next best thing. Thus I have related to you my entire problem as I now see it."},{"pageid":54256,"pagefilename":"83e5a3be37c313044377e7ee3ab08227.jpg","transcription":"If this depression had III not come on and stayed with us so long, I would not have now been writing this letter, and that is the way of life. Etta raised a nice garden and quite a few chickens so that we have been almost able to subsist on what we raise ourselves. Phyllis and Lorna are sure growing, are full of fun and life, and supply the sunshine in our lives. Phyllis is five years of age and has started to school this fall so Lorna has to stay home alone through the day. Mother is feeling quite well and has been busy gardening and raising chickens this summer. Edward entered the University this fall and is working his way through. Clement, Emil and Antonette are at home and Elizabeth is working at Bladew for J.L. Ashmore who operates the State Bank of Bladew. Well I must close for this time and would appreciate to hear from you. If you are unable to do anything in regard to the problem stated, perhaps you could offer some solution of which I am not aware. at least no harm will be done and no bad feelings will result, no matter what you do. With Love from us all, I remain Sincerely, Hugo Pavelka, Bladew, Nebraska R.#.1."}],"title":"Willa Cather and Irene Miner Weisz letters, 1912-1958"}}}

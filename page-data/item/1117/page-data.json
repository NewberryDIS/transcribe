I spent the day as usual, in a quiet, orderly manner - at home.  The forms & faces of\nthose I love, passed to & fro around me, ready to contribute to my enjoyment.  Oh! that I were more worthy of all their love & care.  The hours sped on;  & in their flight, they brought to my meditative heart many a moving thought, both sad & sweet.  And now I am going to muse a little;  noting down a few stray thoughts in connection with the initial day of another year.  I write not by the aid of any personal observations;  but purely from an intrinsic knowledge of what is going on in the great world around me - a knowledge, too, that has drifted in to me from many a peculiar source.  I know upon that day, many a New Year's call was made in the humbler, as well as the higher walks of life.  Many a handsome man bowed before a fair woman to pay to her the customary salutation taking from her hand the cup of sparkling wine, which, in some instances, no doubt, will prove to be the first step in the downward road to ruin.  I know that many a festive board was spread, replete with hospitality & abundance, o'er which presided the charm of manly dignity & womanly grace;  & around which was gathered the loved ones & dear friends.  In many homes of comfort &"},{"pageid":78895,"pagefilename":"b43a0e2c47f5217dd6aa413df9a6609a.jpg","transcription":"3\nplenty.  I know that the happy smile of innocence & child's head was reflected in that of graver years & experiences ;  that fond parents gazed upon their loved ones with gratitude & the thought that they were still with them;  that dutiful children returned the loving gaze & felt equally as gratified for parental love & protection.  I know that many a manly youth & fair maiden awake that new-year's morning with sweet dreams for the coming twelve-months;  some of which will come to pass, & others alas! are destined to be rudely blighted.  I know that our public halls of musements were thrown open;  & that a goodly number of pleasure seekers entered their doors;  that gayety of every kind went on many lives with the sweet strains of music.  I know that many a Christian family gathered around their home alter read the sacred Word, sang their sweet hymns of praise, & knelt before their God in earnest prayer.  But ah! a dark shadow steals over the bright picture that is thus presented to my  mental view.  Tho rings of life are not all smooth & pleasant;  it's skies are not all blue & sunny.  How true it is that one half of the great busy world does not know how the other half lives - knows nothing of it's sufferings & it's woes.  On the other hand I know that the dawn of the New-Year's morning shed it's golden light over thousands of desolate homes & disconsolate"},{"pageid":78896,"pagefilename":"3e60a9d745aaa5a390b16445a2c7496a.jpg","transcription":"4\nhearts;  that it beheld the dark forms of want & bitterness among the rich & the poor, the high & the low.  I know that many a one was prostrated upon the bed of sickness & suffering;  that many a life was born into the world & many a soul went out upon the silent tide of death to the great Hereafter.  I know that bitter tears were shed;  that earnest petitions went up to God in behalf of caring ones, - still loved & cherished, but still wandering in the ways of evil.  I know that many a fireside had its vacant chair & it's empty crib;  that loving hearts, in think of this, went out to the absent & the loved;  some of whom will get returns, & others have gone forever.  I know that many a one, both old & young, in looking over the past year, felt that, by their own folly & indiscretion, something pure & holy has gone out from them, - even the radiant jewel of manhood's honor, & the bright gems of woman's virtue.  Far & near, all over the land, I know that sin & crime, poverty & wickedness, presented many a sad picture, as a dark insult to the brightness & the purity of the new-born year.  And I know that many a man & woman, - many a little child, too, - in every grade of life & its surroundings, awoke that morning, with heavy hearts & depressed spirits.  Perhaps they smiled in the presence of others;  & seemed glad  & happy for the time being.

I know that they wearily took up once more the burden of every-day life.\n\n    Yes, another year has come.  It is the Centennial year, which was ushered in at the lone hour of mid-night, with the booming of cursors & the ringing of bells.  It is the Centennial year, over which my country-men are jointly proved;  for it records the glorious truth that it is one hundred years ago since the adoption of the trio of blended colors, which constitutes our national Banner of Stripes & Stars.  It is the Centennial year, which we, as a nation, are get to celebrate by an Exposition of grandeur & magnificence in one of its largest & most noble cities.\n   God bless & preserve my native land!\n\nTuesday - Jan. 11th -\nIt is now over two months since I wrote my first paragraph in my little home Journal.

As a matter of course, it is entirely dependant upon the leisure hour & the needed item, - which are, by the way, two very necessary requisitions.  There far I have not had any trouble whatever from the latter source.  I love to hear sister Della read allowed from my Journal.  She is a good reader, - giving the right tone & expressions to whatever may be presented to her for perusal.  I only wish that those pages contained purer sentiments & better thoughts, with which to soar with this pleasing accomplishment.  I do not know as I have any particular motive in keeping on with my Journal, - with its hastily written chapters & its other imperfections.  Certain it is that I am not activated by my hopes whatever that it will be published in years to come.  There are not many that will want to  read it bye & bye;  neither does it possess any attractions for the general reader.  A journal that one can pursue with interest & profit, requires a noble, useful life, - a life devoted to some high & special purpose.  But ah! there is many a life around us that is un-selfishly spent for the good of others, which, while it may not have its written record among men, has what is better still, a bright & more enduring one in Heaven.

Yesterday sister Della went to school as usual;  today she leaves, - the High School at Hunt, books, studies, & all.  Thus she shuts upon her farm the door of her school-life, which has its pleasures, as well as its many difficult tasks.  She came home discouraged over her studies: discouraged because she could not stand as high as her girlish ambition naturally soars.  She intimated as much to father, who finally gave his reluctant consent to that which she has done.  I suppose it is all for the best, that others know better than I do about such matters.

From this date I intend to write short articals of prone for its pages, upon whatever subject my present itself to me as easy & suitable.  I shall scatter them simpler efforts, here & there, as I go on, with the hope that they will tend somewhat to relieve the dull monotony of my ordinary paragraphs.

It is an old saying, that the \"pen is mightier than the sword\": & there is a great deal of truth in those old maxims.  The sword is only servicible upon the field of batte; while the pen sways its power in times of war as well as in the day of peace. Its teachings are not confined to anyone current of the literary art. These teachings are brought to bear upon life in all its relations: upon that which is true & beautiful: & that which is low & debasing. Boldly it sets its seal upon the principles of art & science; unclear it gives its opinion upon politics & the many thories of religious beleif; & often it speaks forth with a power that touches, & thrills as it were the great throbbing heart of the nations. At certain times & under peculiar circumstances, this potent influence has been felt & widely acknowledged, all along the path of past ages, up to the present period. And no it will be while there remains a hand to wield the pen: & as long as the human language is spoken.. When we think of this, & note the many evidences of this singular power, it is to be regreted that the teachings of the gifted pen are not more generally devoted to the temporal & spiritual interests of mankind.

This is noticeable when its inspirations shine forth, not in the glowing light of eloquence alone;  but in the softer beams of pathetic tenderness.  It is seen when in the silent wielding of lofty sentiments & impressive words, it touches the secret soul of man;  & helps to teach him the secret lessons of duty & honor.  It is felt when it lifts him up from his natural tendencies;  when it makes him to feel & to realize the solemn fact, that: -  \"It is not all of life to live, Nor all of death to die.\"  The pen that is capable of doing this, is mighty.  It is invented with a deep, potent power;  & all its good influences upon the heart of man is something that cannot be fully estimated.  Its field of labor is broad;  for it is the rich & enlightened world.  It auditors are innumerable;  for it speaks to poor humanity in every condition of life, & in every form of belief & experience.  But its power is not its own by any means.

Our bird formerly belonged to one of the many poor families who suffered at that time, - & who came forth from that terrible ordeal with scarcely a vestige to show of their former home.  I can picture to my mind that single household - how its inmates ran to & fro, wild with terror, - how they watched the angel of Fire, coming nearer & nearer, - how they spoke in hurried whispers, as they gathered together what articles they could, - how the poor bird fluttered wildly about its cage, frightened at the unwanted confusions around it, - how some one, seeing this, took pity upon it, snatched the cage from it hanging hook & bore the helpless creature away in safety, - how it was tenderly cared for & protected for long weeks after the Fire, when it accidently fell into our hands.  It was given to father; & I well remember the night when he brought it home - a cold, winter's night.  Since then it has been with us, receiving due care & attention.  We were much attached to this bird, especially father & mother, who used to call it \"their Fannie.\"  It was quite tame;  but it never used to sing much, - only a few soft notes at certain times.

Oh! that such a storm of snow-flakes, as it were, typical of what is pure & ethereal capable, too, of hiding away so much of the dark earth, might drift down into my heart & life, blotting out from the eye of God, & of others, many a sad mistake along the way.\n\nWednesday evening - Feb. 2nd -\nI did not intend to open my Journal again till some time next week.

Her's is a humble home, but not without many comforts. Her son, Johnnie, is a house-carpenter - by trade - steady & industrious. They live together; & what he earns by hardy toil supports them both; while she in her widow-hood, keeps house for him.  He is a good son; the one unclear? to her declining years.

As she is there seated alone, she hears the door-bell ring.  It is a single stroke, -- not loud, nor startling, but low, soft & almost sad.  She rises from the table, brushing the few crumbs from her clean chequered apron.  Passing through the sitting room, she enters the hall, unlocks and opens the front door.  A tall, well-dressed gentleman stands on the broad step before her.  He bows politely, & after the usual salutations, he adds,--  \"This is Mrs Mason, I believe.\"  \"It is, sir.\" answers the widow.  Here he hesitates, as if at a loss what to say.  He has a cane in his hand, with which, for a brief moment, he toys nervously with a leaf lying at his feet.  Then he speaks, saying,--  \"Madam, you must be as calm--\"  \"Oh, sir,\" she cries, interrupting him, a sudden fear coming over her, \"has there anything happened?\"  \"It pains me deeply, Mrs Mason, to tell you that a sad accident has occurred:--that, not an hour ago, your son Johnnie fell from a high scaffold & was instantly killed!\" he answers, gently, & looking pityingly into her troubled face.  \"\"Fell -- scaffold -- instantly killed!\" iterates the unclear mother, in broken accents.  \"It is even so, Madam.

Oh God, what shall I do?\"  The widows voice is low & husky & there is a wild, hopeless look in her eyes.  The mid-day glory of God's glorious sunshine streams in through the open door.  She stands in its warm, golden light; but into her poor, loving heart, there is creeping the dark shadow of a sudden bereavement.  A faintness comes over her; & reeling forward, she swoons away in the gentleman's arms.  He lifts her up & carries her in,-- out of the warm sunlight into the cool, dark sitting room.  He lays her inanimated form upon the lounge; & then, seeing her condition, hurries out again in search of suitable assistance.  The nearest neighbors are soon made acquainted with what has happened.  One by one they come in; with woman's aid to render & woman's sympathy to give.  The widow is not without relations in the city.  They are also summoned, & they quickly come to her in this time of need.  Gentle hands administer to her the proper restorations; & while she is slowly returning to consciousness, her dead son is brought in.  He is bruised & mangles from his fearful fall.

I remember who spoke to me, & who took my hand in Christain welcome as I sat in my old chair; & how it made me feel that it was good to be in the House of God. That evening, a stranger occupied the pulpit. He was a young minister; but I distinctively remember that I did not see much that was ministerial about him. He was rude, harsh & noisy in his delivery; & to me, not very lucid or edifying in his religious views. No doubt, he was a good Christain, devoted to the Master's cause; & yet, his discourse did not suit me -- did not come to me with any new words of comfort, nor of Scriptural light.

It came to her last Saturday; & with the dawn of that morning, she welcomed the fact that she was seventeen years old. I told her that it was an interesting age; & indeed, it generally is,-- so full of health & promise; so full of sweet hopes & anticipations, known only to the giving, trusting heart, & reaching out, far out into the far-away future. And again, her birth-day comes to her in a beautiful season of the year -- bright, balmy June. It is a season when Spring, having touched & revived the sleeping earth once more, silently departs, & Summer as silently approaches, to unfold to us the vast wealth of green & flowery beauty, that is to be lavishly strewn along the way of the advancing months.

They make quite a sizable package -- a package containing verse after verse & thought upon thought. For the past four years, from time to time, I have been at work upon them -- composing, copying & sending them forth as they have been wanted.

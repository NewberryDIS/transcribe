I spent the day as usual, in a quiet, orderly manner - at home.  The forms & faces of\nthose I love, passed to & fro around me, ready to contribute to my enjoyment.  Oh! that I were more worthy of all their love & care.  The hours sped on;  & in their flight, they brought to my meditative heart many a moving thought, both sad & sweet.  And now I am going to mouse (?) a little;  noting down a few stray thoughts in connection with the initial day of another year.  I write not by the aid of any personal observations;  but purely from an intrinsic knowledge of what is going on in the great world around me - a knowledge, too, that has drifted in to me from many a peculiar source.  I know upon that day, many a New Year's call was made in the humbler, as well as the higher walks of life.  Many a handsome man bowed before a fair woman to pay to her the customary salutation taking from her hand the cup of sparkling wine, which, in some instances, no doubt, will prove to be the first step in the downward road to ruin.  I know that many a festive board was spread, replete with hospitality & abundance, o'er which presided the charm of manly dignity & womanly grace;  & around which was gathered the loved ones & dear friends.  In many homes of comfort &"},{"pageid":78895,"pagefilename":"b43a0e2c47f5217dd6aa413df9a6609a.jpg","transcription":"3\nplenty.  I know that the happy smile of innocence & child's head was reflected in that of graver years & experiences ;  that fond parents gazed upon their loved ones with gratitude & the thought that they were still with them;  that dutiful children returned the loving gaze & felt equally as gratified for parental love & protection.  I know that many a many youth & fair maiden awake that new-year's morning with sweet dreams for the coming twelve-months;  some of which will come to pass, & orhus (?) alas! are destined to be rudely blighted.  I know that our public halls of musements were thrown open;  & that a goodly number of pleasure seekers entered their doors;  that gayety of every kind went on many lives with the sweet strains of music.  I know that many a Christian family gathered around their home alter read the sacred Word, sang their sweet hymns of praise, & knelt before their God in earnest prayer.  But ah! a dark shadow steals over the bright picture that is thus presented to my  mental view.  Tho rings of life are not all smooth & pleasant;  it's skies are not all blue & sunny.  How true it is that one half of the great busy world does not know how the other half lives - knows nothing of it's sufferings & it's woes.  On the other hand I know that the dawn of the New-Year's morning shed it's golden light over thousands of desolate homes & disconsolate"},{"pageid":78896,"pagefilename":"3e60a9d745aaa5a390b16445a2c7496a.jpg","transcription":"4\nhearts;  that it beheld the dark forms of want & bitterness among the rich & the poor, the high & the low.  I know that many a one was prostrated upon the bed of sickness & suffering;  that many a life was born into the world & many a soul went out upon the silent tide of death to the great Hereafter.  I know that bitter tears were shed;  that earnest petitions went up to God in behalf of caring ones, - still loved & cherished, but still wandering in the ways of evil.  I know that many a fireside had its vacant chair & it's empty crib;  that loving hearts, in think of this, went out to the absent & the loved;  some of whom will get returns, & others have gone forever.  I know that many a one, both old & young, in looking over the past year, felt that, by their own folly & indiscretion, something pure & holy has gone out from them, - even the radiant jewel of mans ___ ___, & the bright gems of woman's virtue.  Far & near, all over the land, I know that sin & crime, poverty & wickedness, presented many a sad picture, as a dark ___ to the brightness & the purity of the new-born year.  And I know that many a man & woman, - many a little child, too, - in every grade of life & its surroundings, awoke that morning, with heavy hearts & depressed spirits.  Perhaps they smiled in the presence of others;  & seemed glad  & happy for the time being.   But taking the sad truth to their se-"},{"pageid":78897,"pagefilename":"10043d20671b264b13413bfa443d53fb.jpg","transcription":"5\ncret hearts, that for them at least, the new year had brought no changes, no prospect of brighter days to come.  I know that they wearily took up once more the burden of every-day life.\n\n    Yes, another year has come.  It is the Centennial year, which was ushered in at the lone hour of mid-night, with the booming of cursors & the ringing of bells.  It is the Centennial year, over which my country-men are jointly proved;  for it records the glorious truth that it is one hundred years ago since the adoption of the trio of blended colors, which constitutes our national Banner of Stripes & Stars.  It is the Centennial year, which we, as a nation, are get to celebrate by an Exposition of grandeur & magnificence in one of its largest & most noble cities.\n   God bless & preserve my native land!\n\nTuesday - Jan. 11th -\nIt is now over two months since I wrote my first paragraph in my little home Journal.  It has become to be like an old friend, to whom I can go at all times, & give to its pages some portion of my daily thoughts, as I can do to no one else in the wide world.

As a matter of course, it is entirely dependant upon the leisure hour & the needed item, - which are, by the way, two very necessary requisitions.  There far I have not had any trouble whatever from the latter source.  I love to hear sister Della read allowed from my Journal.  She is a good reader, - giving the right tone & expressions to whatever may be presented to her for perusal.  I only wish that those pages contained puris (?) sentiments & better thoughts, with which to soar with this pleasing accomplishment.  I do not know as I have any particular motive in keeping on with my Journal, - with its hastily written chapters & its other imperfections.  Certain it is that I am not activated by my hopes whatever that it will be published in years to come.  There are not many that will want to  read it bye & bye;  neither does it possess any attractions for the general reader.  A journal that one can pursue with interest & profit, requires a noble, useful life, - a life devoted to some high & special purpose.  But ah! there is many a life around us that is un-selfishly spent for the good of others, which, while it may not have its written record among men, has what is better still, a bright & more enduring one in Heaven.  Moreover I know that o'er these pages there prevails a perpetual spirit of sadness.

Still I keep on, because I have become attached to it, & as a natural sequence, I do not want to lay it aside.  But at the same time, I have this sad conviction that, were I to stop right here, letting this be my last paragraph, there are only a very few - scarcely any I might say, who would care a single straw!\nWednesday Evening - Jan. 12th -\nThe days come & go;  & in their rapid flight, we do not know what each will bring forth.  Yesterday sister Della went to school as usual;  today she leaves, - the High School at Hunt, books, studies, & all.  Thus she shuts upon her farm the door of her school-life, which has its pleasures, as well as its many difficult tasks.  She came home discouraged over her studies: discouraged because she could not stand as high as her girlish ambition naturally soars.  She intimated as much to father, who finally gave his reluctant consent to that which she has done.  I suppose it is all for the best, that others know better than I do about such matters.  But still I cannot help but fell sorry that she thought it"},{"pageid":78900,"pagefilename":"bf5421748458cd48d27bd5f838f424c8.jpg","transcription":"8\nbest to take this step, - just now at least.  I did hope that she persevere & keep on, so that in olive season, she would come forth, her young life enriched with the shining pearls of a thorough education.\nTuesday Evening - Jan. 18th - \nI am going to make a change in the general tone of my home Journal.  From this date I intend to write short articals of prone for its pages, upon whatever subject my present itself to me as easy & suitable.  I shall scatter them simpler efforts, here & there, as I go on, with the hope that they will tend somewhat to relieve the dull monotony of my ordinary paragraphs.  In some respects they will resemble our Autumn leaves - those that are rich, golden & attractive; & which we so often see scattered over the ground & lying in close proximity to many a leaf that is dull & colorless.  Tomorrow I intend to give my Journal its first  essay.\nPower of the Pen\nIt is a fact which cannot be disputed that the human pen is mighty - that it is frequently invested with a"},{"pageid":78901,"pagefilename":"bb50e864456740f5f05cd6ef500ae715.jpg","transcription":"9\npotent & far-reaching power.

This is noticeable when its inspirations shine forth, not in the glowing light of eloquence alone;  but in the softer beams of pathetic tenderness.  It is seen when in the silent wielding of lofty sentiments & impressive words, it touches the secret soul of man;  & helps to teach him the secret lessons of duty & honor.  It is felt when it lifts him up from his natural tendencies;  when it makes him to feel & to realize the solemn fact, that: -  \"It is not all of life to live, Nor all of death to die.\"  The pen that is capable of doing this, is mighty.  It is invented with a deep, potent power;  & all its good influences upon the heart of man is something that cannot be fully estimated.  Its field of labor is broad;  for it is the rich & enlightened world.  It auditors are innumerable;  for it speaks to ___ humanity in every condition of life, & in every form of belief & experience.  But its power is not its own by any means.  It has a diviner source than that of earth - a more exalted origin than the mere intellect of man.

Our bird formerly belonged to one of the many poor families who suffered at that time, - & who came forth from that terrible ordeal with scarcely a vestige to show of their former home.  I can picture to my mind that single household - how its inmates ran to & fro, wild with terror, - how they watched the angel of Fire, coming nearer & nearer, - how they spoke in hurried whispers, as they gathered together what articles they could, - how the poor bird fluttered wildly about its cage, frightened at the unwanted confusions around it, - how some one, seeing this, took pity upon it, snatched the cage from it hanging hook & bore the helpless creature away in safety, - how it was tenderly cared for & protected for long weeks after the Fire, when it accidently fell into our hands.  It was given to father; & I well remember the night when he brought it home - a cold, winter's night.  Since then it has been with us, receiving due care & attention.  We were much attached to this bird, especially father & mother, who used to call it \"their Fannie.\"  It was quite tame;  but it never used to sing much, - only a few soft notes at certain times.  This one little song was peculiar in itself;  & to me it was a pleasing contrast to the loud, shrill notes of its more at-"},{"pageid":78907,"pagefilename":"ed1597ee166a96f5961e3a95f7f170f9.jpg","transcription":"15\ntractive off-spring.

But the hand of God fashioned it & gave it life, just as He has created in almost every human heart, a certain chord, which goes out in love for these \"house-hold pets.\"  Only a bird.  But the gaze of pity rested upon it, as it dropped & died that morning.  And when it was all over, gentle hands brought it to me that I might see it.  Those hands made a soft resting place for the lifeless  bird;  but ah! those hands had other duties to preform, & poor Fannie was quietly assigned to a more suitable & permanent repose.\n\nTuesday - Feb. 1st -\nAs this is the first day of the month, & the current month is the shortest one in the year, it seems quite suitable to write a short paragraph.  I also give my Journal quite a new feature today - even a little acrostic. To me, as well as to thousands of others, who from various corners have been confined to the house all winter, the near approach of spring suggests pleasing thoughts & pleasant anticipations.  I am well aware that the reigns of Winter is wisely appointed.

Early this afternoon, the \"beautiful snow\" commenced to fall; & it has continued to do so, more or less, all day.  I sat at the window & watched the feathery snow-flakes, drifting down thick & fast from the leaden clouds, & rapidly hiding from my view the dark, cold earth.  And seated there, I fell to musing; & in the midst of my musings, this wish came to one.  Oh! that such a storm of snow-flakes, as it were, typical of what is pure & ethereal capable, too, of hiding away so much of the dark earth, might drift down into my heart & life, blotting out from the eye of God, & of others, many a sad mistake along the way.\n\nWednesday evening - Feb. 2nd -\nI did not intend to open my Journal again till some time next week.

I took out the little package of hymns & songs about which I have written in a previous paragraph.  I took off the rubber band;  added four more similar efforts to the number; & then laid them away again.  Now this may seem a very insignificant thing to do;  but to me it was associated with a mingled sense of gladness & regret.  I think we do a great many little acts in our daily life, which yields to us a peculiar pleasure, or sorrow, as the case may be.  I felt glad, this morning, that I had these four efforts to add to the list;  but sorry when I thought that these fourteen efforts, which are among the best I have ever written, were laying in my drawer useless.

I often wish that I were more worthy of my gift as a writer such as it is;  or that God had bestowed it upon some one else,  who could show a better heart & life in return.  That I am gifted in some respects & that He has brought out this gift in a remarkable manner, I do not hesitate to say.  But this statement is not made with any desire to speak in my own fraise.  On the contrary, this acknowledgement is not without its dark tinge of self-reproach & humiliations.  I have been taught by a bitter experience that to be gifted even in as small degree as I am, is to walk a dangerous path;  that to every ____ thought or sentiment that the human heart may have a score of others entirely different in their nature are always ready to spring up & cast a blight o'er the former's purity & purpose.  I have this, however, to comfort me - this to lighten the sad reflections which sometimes comes to my heart.  From the word of God, even from the lips of Christ.

My school lessons are harder now than it ever was before.

Sometimes I feel very much discouraged having the same routine from week to week, but the best way to do is to do the best you can today, and let tomorrow take care of itself.  All of our class are well.  I suppose you have heard that Miss Wood has left us on account of the death of her father; it was a sore misfortune to us to have both teachers leave us at one time, but we had to do the best we could.  Our exercise for tomorrow is, to write a description of what we saw today, in the form of a letter and give it to Mrs Warren to be corrected.  All the family are well and send their \"well wishes\" to you.  We have a holiday today, it being Washingtons birthday.

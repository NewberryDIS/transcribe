The impropriety of making him the disbursing officer is increased, if possible, by the fact that his bond is but for $75,000- Only one fifth of the amount proposed to be placed in his hands. As you suspended the smaller requisition for $39,000 to give them the opportunity to show whether the allegation of fraud which they made as to the claims generally, applied to that particular claim, they are led to expect that you will cause the requisition for the $371,033- to be suspended in like manner to hear them on the matters of fact above set forth even though the question of law be settled in your mind against them.\n\n                                     You do us the honor to give additional weight to the letter of the Delegation of yesterday because of our professional association with them and presentation of their statements.

On certain days they used to assemble in these places of worship, early in the morning, when the priest would commence his talk. The people were all seated and observed perfect silence.  No one durst speak, or make the least noise while the priest was talking. About noon the priest became very much fatigued, but still continued his discourse till near sunset.  He enforced obedience to God in every respect, telling the people they must do all that God had directed them and never disobey in any secret place, thinking themselves alone; for God always saw them, and was with them.  He exhorted the people never to indulge in any idle or vain conversation, nor call anyone [A ski ni], because it was wicked.  He urged them to abstain from all lewdness and from Polygamy. Children he exhorted to be industrious and alwas [ ? ] their parents. He enforced his exhortations by holding up to the people the prospects of futurity, assuring that if they were obedient, when they died, they would go to God, and dwell forever with Him, where it would be always light, like a pleasant delightful day.  But that if they were disobedient, they would be miserable forever in a lake of fire.   That just as they got to that plaic an awful gulph would appear before them, across which they would see a small pole, with a black dog at each end.  Being impelled forward, they would go onto the middle of this pole, and then the dogs would turn it, and plunge them off into the gulph or lake of fire.  Some few, however, might be permitted to cross, but on arriving at the other side, they wold be put into a house of fire, and transfixed with large iron spikes, and thus tortured forever.

No one durst speak, or make the least noise while the priest was talking. About noon the priest became very much fatigued, but still continued his discourse till near sunset.  He enforced obedience to God in every respect, telling the people they must do all that God had directed them and never disobey in any secret place, thinking themselves alone; for God always saw them, and was with them.  He exhorted the people never to indulge in any idle or vain conversation, nor call anyone [A ski ni], because it was wicked.  He urged them to abstain from all lewdness and from Polygamy. Children he exhorted to be industrious and alwas [ ? ] their parents. He enforced his exhortations by holding up to the people the prospects of futurity, assuring that if they were obedient, when they died, they would go to God, and dwell forever with Him, where it would be always light, like a pleasant delightful day.

That used in war was the largest, that used by the civil priests in the various feasts and [munific?]cations at home, was next in size. The one used at the hunters feasts and in various ceremonies connected with hunting was the next.  After this was one used for finding things lost or stolen and last of all was that used for determining the time anyone had to live. These stones are chrystalline quartz, with six sides, coming to a point at one end like the diamond, are perfectly transparent, and were doubtless selected instead of to take the [place?] of the diamond used by the ancients, [unclear], [diagram of 6-sided structure resembling a house], only regular in its parts.

Some were devoted by their parents to sacred offices in infancy, or rather inherited by hereditary right such offices. In case the child was to be thus set apart, the priest who was to have the care of his education was called as soon as the child was born, to take it under his tuition. Before it was put to their breast he gave it a kind of purifying drink; and as the child was not able to fast, he directed the parents to fast for it seven days, eating only at night about sunset. As the child grew up he was watched with the utmost scrutiny. And as the mother was liable to her [month by courses?] the son was delivered as soon as possible into the hands of a grandmother or some aged matron, not subject to any female defilements; and her eye was almost continually upon him. She would not allow him to go into any home as he pleased and sit down lest he should be defiled by some [polluted?] seat. Neither must he eat any food but such as his [protectants] pronounced clean. She also guarded \nhim from any defilement from the dead. As he became capable of understanding he was taken to the priest who spent occasionally twenty hours with him, without eating or   [unclear], instructing him in the great doctrines and duties of religion but especially in those ceremonies connected with the use of the [Dou lu za ta].

Every one else has undisputed right to himself, the wife of his bosom and his own dear children but the slave wherever he may be, is robd of these inestimable blessings. He is exposed every hour to be torn from their fond embrace and sent hundreds of miles distant never, never to see them again in this world of sin and sorrow. But how cheering the thought if they love and serve the Lord Jesus Christ as many of them do he will save them and they will meet in heaven where \"the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest\" Oh happy time! when after dragging out their miserable lives beneath the scorching rays of a southern sun, they will meet to sing praises to God for his mercy in calling them from the bondage of sin to the glorious liberty of the gospel. The question comes to my mind where will the slaveholder be in that day? It is a solomn question indeed. If he does not repent he will in all probability have to stand at the left hand and the judge will say to him \"inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these my brethren ye did it unto me\" M. H.

Lovely thing, said I, who and whence art thou? My story is soon told, was the reply. I will relate it. Long and somewhat eventful has my life been, and its idle hours few. First startled into existence by the power of an electrical machine in year 1790, my earliest recollections are connected with the laboratory of the chemist and I well remember with what joy and pride I was looked upon as the result of the onward march of science, and as the reward of the philosopher's patient investigation.

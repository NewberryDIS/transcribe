It requires a\ngreat deal of money to keep the camp\nfires burning.  \nSeveral months ago Judge Philip\nBregstone volunteered to take charge\nof one entertainment.  He consulted \nhis friend, Mr. Joseph Kessler, the cele-\nrated Yiddish actor, who is at the \nhead of one of the finest Yiddish play-\ning companies in the world, and who\nhappens to have a lease on the Hay-\nmarket Theater.  Mr. Kessler offered \nthe use of his theater and the services\nof his company at actual cost.  Judge\nBregstone then organized an execu-\ntive committee, consisting of himself \nas charman, Mr. Fred Bernstein as \nvice-chairman, Mrs. Philip Bregstone\nas chairman of the ladies, and Mrs. \nFred Bernstein as vice-chairman.

I became so interested in this\nclass that I joined a second year and also encouraged my friends to join.\nWe not only worked in the garden, but took notes from lectures given by our\nInstructor, Mr. Stone. The subjects of these lectures were:\n(a) The Garden: We learned how to plant a garden, when to plant it, the best\nconditions for it, etc.\n(b) The Soils: We studies the kinds of soils, types of soils, their origin, etc.\n(c) The Plants: We studied the parts of a plant, parts of a flower, classifica-\nion of plants, etc.\n(d) The Animals: We studied domestication and care of animals, composition\nof milk, etc.\nWe also studied the lives of great men who made discoveries in the sciences \nwhich we studied.\nAfter the lectures we would go out to our gardens, which we took special care\nof.  In my garden, I planted radishes, carrots, beets, turnips, parsley, beans, lettuce,\nspinach, onions, kohl-rabi and corn.\nWe expect to have a gardening exhibition where the best vegetables will be\nexhibited.  We will also have commencement exercises, when the prizes will be \ndistributed.\nThe last event of the season will be a gardening banquet, strictly vegetarian,\nthe vegetables being picked from our own gardens.\nI have enjoyed the work of our class and have benefited both physically and \nmentally.  I intend to join again next year and also encourage my friends to join.\nI can never be too grateful for what this class has done for me.  \nAgricultural/Gardening Exhibition Pictures 1917--images\nTWO VIEWS OF OUR\nAGRICULTURAL EXHIBITION\nPictures taken of the gardening exhibit\niN, in 1917.\nTHE SOIL \nEXHIBIT.\nThe soil exhibit was very nearly arranged by a girl member of the class.\nIn one row there were the different rocks and minerals, in order of\nsize, that make up the soil, showing the origin and evolution of our\nsoils.  Another row was filled with testing devices for the quality of\nthe soil as to its composition, its organic matter, its lime content.  Another row was\nfilled with samples of types of soils.  The soil exhibitor had difficulty in finding a \nsample of humus, as it is hard to find it in the city.  The samples of soils were placed in\njars of water, so as to show distinctly the different layers that make up the compo-\nsition of the soil.  On the last row of the table were displayed numerous kinds of \ncommercial fertilizers.\nDescription of soil exhibit arranged by \nIrma Bregstone for the gardening exposition.\nFrom the C. H.L.

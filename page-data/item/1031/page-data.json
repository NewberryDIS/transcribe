After the surrender of the port, he was granted sick furlough, which was essential to his continuance in service.\n     At Port Hudson, the troops were in constant conflict with the enemy from the 12\" May to the Surrender 8\" July.  The assaults of the 28\" May & 14\" June were gallant though desperate attempts to carry works, well nigh impregnable, defended with great constancy by troops equal in number to the besieging forces.  The battle at Cedar Mountain was one of the most  sang [illegible] of the war.

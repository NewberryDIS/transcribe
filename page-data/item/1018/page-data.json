When I was two days out I saw a large band\nof Indians coming towards us, they turned out to be Utahs.\nThe Mexican advised me to mount my horse\nand to make my escape as the Indians had no\nanimal that could catch me and as for him\nhe thought the Indians would not harm him\nthough they would in all probability kill me"},{"pageid":67416,"pagefilename":"85e743d3a5617216f37c2f04003b8677.jpg","transcription":"if they should capture me.\nI considered the advice very good and was about\nto accept it when I changed my mind and\nthought how cowardly it would be in \nme to desert that so willingly offered\nto sacrifice his life to save mine. So I told him \nthat I would remain and I would die with \nhim. The Indians were rapidly approaching\nwith one old chief some distance in advance of the rest. This chief \ncame towards me with a smile on his countenance, the old \nrascal? and offered me his hand, I proffered\nmine in return but instead of taking it, he \ncaught hold of my rifle  & endeavored to take it\nfrom me, we tussled for a short time and I\nmade him let go of his hold. Then the remainder of the Indians arrived and kept up a loud talk among \nthemselves. Some of them rode about\nus examining their guns, opening their ?, knocking?\nthe priming of their rifles and making many other\nmaneuvers that would tend to frighten us, or\ninduce us to change our positions so that they could fire \nand kill us before we could return their fire.\nWe watched them closely and determined that the\nfirst one that raised his gun should be shot. \nThey hovered about us for nearly half\nhour and then seeing but little chance of \nkilling us without loosing two of ?\nof their own party, they left us abruptly. I thereupon continued my journey and\nin a few days arrived at Bent's Fort without having met\nwith any further difficulty. I \nwas then informed by Wm.? Bent that the Dragoons had \ncaught the Texans, had disarmed them and that the train\nhad continued on its march without further interruption ?\nconsider it necessary to come to the

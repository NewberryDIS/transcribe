With joy I shall go to spend the vacation at home. With sorrow I shall part with friends formed here, some of them never to meet again until eternity shall with us commence. I would that I could hope to meet them all in heaven. Can it be that some will be missing? O, has my duty been done to them? What use a person's feelings who knows that an opportunity to do good for eternity has been unimproved? Can I not line as a christian? I have tried; but not in earnest. Remember me, Mary, when you pray to him who alone can aid. There is a great deal for us to do before going to heaven, if God leaves us here any length of time. There is enough work to be done, though every christian upon earth should employ his hands diligently through life.

In one part of your letter you have let fall some faint hints about my being at home, and some faint shadow of a suspicion as to the cause; either that I had voluntarily left, or had been suspended or had been expelled.

Since the recent merger, a number of changes have been made, one of which has affected my activities considerably. Since we started our publication six years ago, the tractor industry has undergone a number of changes, changes which for the most part have been occasioned by agricultural depression. The production of the old manufacturers has been decreasing for four years, while the production of the Ford Motor Co. has increased until it is about 80 per cent of the total. The old manufacturers have resented Ford's invasion of the tractor field, which made it impossible to cover the entire field. The old manufacturers would not support a publication devoted to the industry unless we kept the Ford out of it, and in view of the fact that Ford is producing such a majority of all tractors, and is increasing his production about 50 per cent every year, we finally decided to make it a Fordson publication.\nNaturally a change so radical has made it necessary to do a lot of hard work. The Ford Motor Co. is making its tractor quite a factor in industries other than agriculture, and since this change was made, I have had to dig up a lot of industrial articles on the use of the Fordson. Since the first of March for instance, I have watched tractors pull submarine cables from the bottom of the Delaware River; pulls cables through underground conduits; raise material in constructing buildings; load White Star lines in New York City; do excavating work in Brooklyn; build and maintain roads in Virginia; do logging work in the Dismal Swap in North Carolina; haul materials in the Studebaker factory in South Bend; hauling lumber in Chicago, and several other things. In the next few weeks I expect to be in Bradford, Pa., Louisville, Ky. and Greensboro, N.C. In addition I get to New York about twice a month at least. It means about two weeks traveling every month, and two weeks work in the office.\nThree weeks ago tomorrow I left for Detroit by way of New York, having a short visit with Margaret while in New York. I spent three days in Detroit, the next three in Chicago, Sunday in Waukegan with some friends, driving to Zion City 6 miles away in the afternoon, and hearing Voliva and his choir of 500 voices; Monday in Joliet and Ottawa, Ill.; Tuesday in Michigan City and South Bend; Wednesday in Cleveland, Youngstown and Akron, and Thursday in Canton and North Canton, getting home Friday morning. Traveling is strenuous work, but I don't seem able to get below 180 lb."},{"pageid":32789,"pagefilename":"626ced419a14e268733dc53a2bb2e36b.jpg","transcription":"CHILTON COMPANY\nC.A.

Margaret also was here visiting with Dorothy and Junior a couple of days while I was gone, and Junior had to celebrate his eighth birthday without paternal assistance. He got theorugh the ordeal, all right however. He has been meaning to write you and thank you for the coin you sent him, which we found to be a British penny of 1806 with George III on it. The oldest modern coin he has is a Spanish one made in 1712, but he also has acquired a couple of old Roman ones, one of which has an image of Constantine, which would make it about 300 A.D., and the other which he is unable to identify as to any particular period or reign. Outside of being a bug on stamps and coins, his main activity is music and he is now playing such pieces as Schubert's Serenade and Mendelssohn's Spring Song.\nWhile in Chicago I saw Everett, who looks more like a boy than Junior, because he dresses more like one and has his hair closely shingled. He is somewhat stockier than Junior and I thoughtperhaps somewhat taller, as he came to my top vest button, but Junior goes about an inch above the same button on the same suit. Everett knows a lot about history and seems greatly interested in it. Rachel was asleep.\nI am inclosing a little booklet which I received a few days ago and which I am sending for Edward's benefit. I think it expresses the thought that Bob and I both have regarding what he should do, that there is a greater demand for brains and ideas in the business world than in the professions. Through my experiences with the Chilton Company and contact with manufacturing institutions I am led to believe that the field of merchandising presents greater opportunities than any other. It is now on a higher plane than ever before and involves the human element more than any profession almost. Business nowadays contemplates the habits of the human race, their psychology, analaysis of buying habits, how to reach the people even though it may involve changing their habits, advertising and a lot of things which must precede selling campaigns and keep buyers satisfied after sales are made. The business world is full of romance. Five years ago everybody was satisfied with a wooden pencil with a piece of graphite in the center. Now the Eversharp business runs into millions every year. Back of this was business brains which made an Eversharp a necessity instead of a luxury. The talking machine people doubtless would be willing to pay a million dollars to some one who could devise some idea which would enable them to maintain their former volume of business in the face of radio competition. A friend of mine in Kansas City, who is an advertising man, was recently given $25,000 worth of stock in a company manufacturing a product for Ford cars and trucks, because he was able to devise a plan for advertising it and enabling dealers to sell it.

But there are so many things in the business world. Motor buses are competing with railroads and electric lines for passenger business, and motor trucks are cutting into freight business of the railroads. Motor lines are seeking ways to increase business and railroads are trying to counteract them. Even the millers in Minneapolis would like to find some way to market 200,000,000 more bushels of wheat made into flour, or other products. Farmers are trying to find ways of marketing their products as did the fruit growers of California, who are now selling nearly ten times as many oranges as they did ten years ago. There are big oppotunities in almost every business. Their commodities may differ but their problems are much the same. Sales managers are making thousands where college professors and presidents are making hundreds.

You will find Walter a very affable and congenial person, willing to assist you if he possibly can, although perhaps you may obtain the impression that he is somewhat proud of himself. If he does seem a little overbearing, and I don't think it will be very noticeable, just remember that he has pretty good reason to be. His success has been due largely to his own efforts. I have known his father a great many years. He is a man of just fair ability, who had a large family, and Walter was compelled to educate himself at Baker University and has made his own way ever since he was in high school. Walter and I were associated together for several years and our greatest diversion when we are together after we have dismissed business discussions is to see a baseball game together or discuss baseball if it isn't possible to see a game.\nHope you are fortunate in getting what you want.\nKindest regards,\nYour brother,\nHEE"},{"pageid":32792,"pagefilename":"b155e0de2b403853be4a332a7e7311bb.jpg","transcription":"fr.

You will, therefore, assume command of the two companies designated, in Special Orders, No. 141, current series, from the Head Quarters, for the garrison of Sitka, as soon as the same are ready to embark on the transport chartered for that purpose.\n2. In accordance with instructions from the General-in-Chief of the Army, the Military District of Alaska will, until further orders, be attached to the Department of California. You will, therefore, report directly to the Head Quarters of that Department, at San Francisco, California.\n3. Should you reach Sitka before the arrival of the commissioners appointed to transfer and receive formal possession under the provisions of the Treaty, you will retain your command on the transport until such formal transfer is made. If, however, the commissioner on the part of the United States should request you to take part in the formal proceedings of the transfer, you will do so, wither personally, or with your command.

Notwithstanding the most benevolent intentions of the Emperor towards his American Colonies, their immense distance from the Metropolitan Government, and the delay and difficulties of communication, have probably heretofore prevented the application to them of the same fostering care which they otherwise would have received. They have been too far from the heart of a vast Empire to feel the warmth of the life-current, and enjoy the vitality, of the government of a common country. Hence the trade of their colonies has languished, their agriculture has been neglected, and their general progress almost imperceptible. Perhaps these facts have constituted the moving causes which induced his Imperial Majesty to consent to the cession of this territory, and the transfer of the allegiance of its inhabitants to the United States, as a Government more capable, from its proximity, of promoting its interests and supplying its wants. 15. But henceforth the citizens of that territory who elect to remain will be Entitled to all the rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed by the constitution of the United States to all the inhabitants of our Republic. They will be under the protection and care of our government.

They will have unrestricted intercourse and commerce with all the States and territories of the Federal Union, subject only to the ordinary custom-House regulations of internal and coast-wide trade.

It may be proper to remark, in this place, that it is a well established principle of international law that a change of sovereignty involves no change in the rights of private property, whether of individuals or of municipal corporations, and that the existing laws of any territory acquired by the United States by conquest or cession which do not conflict with the constitution and fundamental principles of our government, remain in the free till suspended, altered, amended, or repealed by proper authority.

In regard to the tribal and uncivilized Indians on Barauoff Island, and the adjacent islands and coast, you will exercise the most careful vigilance, as these natives are known to be both warlike and treacherous.  You will consult with the Russian Governor and other officers in regard to regulating their intercourse with the post and settlement of Sitka, and you will strictly enforce, both with regard to the whites and the natives, such regulations as you may deem necessary to adopt with regard to those Indians and their intercourse with our people.

The Russians have occupied the territory which constitutes your command for a long period of years; their number has always been small, and their military forces never equal to those which will be placed under your orders; nevertheless, their officers, agents and merchants have travelled unmolested through most parts of that vast country.  Indian hostilities there have been limited to one of the temporary outbreaks near Sitka.  The British Government has occupied, directly, and by means of its commercial companies, their agents and servants, an Indian country in this continent, greater in extent than the whole United States, and containing a larger number of tribal and uncivilized Indians than we have.

In this connection, you will have in mind that neither the Russian nor the British government on this continent has ever made Indian treaties, had an Indian Bureau, or Indian Superintendent and Agents, or paid millions of dollars for Indians annuities and Indian goods, which were promised to, but never received by, the native Indians. \n\t24.

Brevet Major General J. C. Davis. Present.\nGeneral:\nIn addition to the general instructions which I have been given you, today by the Division Commander, he directed me to add the following remarks as Confidential.\nIt is probable that the Governor's House and other public buildings of Sitka will be turned over to you, and that they can be made available for the occupation of yourself and your command, during the coming winter. It is also probable that, during the next session of Congress, a Territorial Government will be organized for the ceded Russian-American possessions?, and that the officers of such Territorial Government will be located at Sitka or? the Capital. And it is possible that orders may be received to turn over, to such civil officers, the buildings at that place which are now occupied by the Russian authorities, and which may be transferred to you. And, further, it is quite possible that within a few years the trade and commerce of Sitka will be such as to require the occupation, for commercial purposes, of the sites of the present redoubt?, Governor's House, barracks, and Russian storehouses.\nUnder these circumstances, it may be well to provide for an early abandonment of the site of the Town of Sitka, as a military post, and the transfer of the military establishment to Japan? Island.\nIt appears, from the best maps in our possessions, that the Island"},{"pageid":73079,"pagefilename":"7d16f7cd4d818003b7c7db43acc00b21.jpg","transcription":"is about a mile in length, its greatest width about half a mile, and that it lies directly opposite the town of Sitka, and distant from it only about a quarter of a mile. If, in your opinion, this island is required for military purposes, you will designate and occupy it as a military reservation, and erect thereon? such of the buildings sent? with your command as you may deem proper. Should you deem it best, you are authorized to locate most of your military forces on this Island, and to construct a proper wharf for landing. In that case, little or no money will be expended on the buildings at Sitka proper, and your arrangements will be made in the? supposition that Japan? Island is to be the military depot for the District.\nAs our information in regard to the topographical character of the several localities in Sitka Harbor is very imperfect, the location of the military depot is left to your discretion and judgement, after a careful examination of Sitka and the adjacent country. It is probable, however, that you will find it advisable, for the present, to station? your command in the Town of Sitka.\nThere are several other islands which seem to command the different entrances to the harbor or anchorage. You will designate as military reservations such of these as you may deem necessary to be occupied for military defence, and prevent their occupation by Squatters and settlers. You will notify any persons? who attempt to build upon them that they are not open to settlement, and that they will not be allowed compensation for improvements which they may make. \nYou will report? in full upon this subject, with maps of such lands as you think should be declared military reservations by proclamation? of the President of the United States.\nVery Respectfully, Your off. unclear\nJames B.

The next morning I found fifty two things mentioned on the bill of fare for breakfast. Luncheon, tea, & supper are also supplied to its guests by this establishment.

It is possible that, by a singular sum of good luck, I may have always been at a warm place, when the weather was cold elsewhere, but it is literally true that during the winter I never once had occasion to put on an overcoat, excepting when I was in Canada at its breaking up.

And so when we walk through the streets of a city larger than most European Capitals, & find none of the buildings we are in the? habit of seeing everywhere else, we condemn it as architecturally poor.  This feeling is increased in New York by the fact that there is nothing very striking in Broadway, its main Street, except its length.

All its districts\nhave much the same productions; the result of which is the minimum \nof home trade.  How enormous must be the differences which must result\nto Italy & ourselves from this dissimilarity in our respective circumstances!  I apply\nthis to the United States of America.  The cause which has contributed so\nmuch to make us wealthy, intelligent, & commercial is to be found in\nthe United States - with the difference, however, that what has been done\nhere on a very small scale is there done, & has yet to be done on an\nenormous scale.

From the little I saw of them I can add that they appeared to me as spiritual as the French themselves. I am more disposed to believe that this is hereditary, than that it is the result merely of imitation. But with respect to their personal appearance, after having of late seen so many of the coarse and ill-visaged half-breed in which an Anglo-Saxon was the father, I was much struck with their superiority in face & figure. The features of many might almost have been called delicate and refined; & it was so, strange to say, even when very perceptible traces of the African nose & lips remained, & these still surmounted with the African wool. I understood that this was also to a great extent the case where a Spaniard was the Father. The reason of this difference I believe to be a very obvious one, the Frenchmen & Spaniards, having much smaller bones that the Northern nations, are better able in the unclear to connect , in their mixed descendants, this grossness of the physiognomy & figure of the African. The German half-breeds are still more unattractive than the Anglo-Saxon; the Scandinavian are worse; but the worst of all are those whose long-headed, & high cheek-bones Father came from North of the Tweed."},{"pageid":59011,"pagefilename":"a17e540a88771cf03b3a30114d6774ce.jpg","transcription":"176\nNo one without having seen the thing himself - & the jolting will impress it on his memory - can form any proper conception of the holes, the mud, & the pools of water which not unfrequently constitute what is called in America a road. At Augusta I had seen axles disappear in the main streets. But the most advanced specimen of this kind of means of communication I ever passed over was in going to the station of the Mississippi & Tennessee railway at New Orleans. I could not see, or hear that any attempt had ever been made to form a road. The traffic was great; & was of course confined by the houses to a narrow street. It was a natural swamp. & there had been lately a great deal of rain. My reflections on arriving at last at the station were, that American horses were wonderful animals; & that in nothing did the Americans themselves show their inventive prowess so triumphantly as in constructing carriages which could carry heavy loads day after day through such difficulties; I do not unclear through such roads, because there was nothing but a collection of the hindrances to travelling which a road is made to remedy. \nThis is a subject on which the Americans are very tolerant & easily satisfied. \"Sir,\" said a gentleman to me, on the top of Well's & Fargo's Coach, as we were passing over the Plains to Denver, \"Sir, this is the finest piece of road in the world.\" As nothing had been said previously about roads, & what we were passing along was merely..."},{"pageid":59012,"pagefilename":"9b998ce230dd282abd85d40a7e1e5901.jpg","transcription":"177\n...a freight track on the dry Prairie, four inches deep in dust & sand & earth in fine weather, and as many or more inches deep in mud in wet weather.

The water stands everywhere. The Palmetto and the Swamp-cedar grow out of the water. The trees are completely shrouded with the gray Spanish Moss. The trees and the moss look as if they had long been dead. One who enters the city by this approach (had ever any other great city such an approach?) must carry with him some not very encouraging thoughts. Whenever in the summer or autumn the wind blows from this direction, I suppose it will remind him of the yellow fever, the horrible scourge of the place.\nThe swamp I just mentioned is succeeded by sugar plantations, the costly machinery of which had been destroyed during the war. They now appeared to be used as grazing farms for cattle brought up from Texas. On one of these ruined plantations I saw some hedges of the Cherokee Rose. This is an evergreen & makes too wide a hedge; though it might maybe an advantage in that climate. It is a common opinion in New Orleans that all these sugar plantations will eventually be reestablished; but that this will never be done by the present proprietors who are all ruined, & who will have to sell the land at a merely nominal price, which is all that the land without the machinery is worth. Those who will buy the land will be Companies, or Northern men who will have capital enough to purchase new machinery, & to pay the heavy costs of carrying on the cultivation of the cane, & manufacture of sugar."},{"pageid":59014,"pagefilename":"b1619e08efdbdb62b52507045365cef8.jpg","transcription":"179\nChapter 10\nOne hears a great deal of accidents on American railways, & they certainly appear to be very frequent, & often to be most fearful. It is not an uncommon consequence of a railway accident in winter that a great part of the passengers are burnt to death. This arises from the fact that an American railway car is a long box containing between fifty & sixty people, generally with a red hot stove in winter at each end, & without any possible means of egress except by the door at each end. The natural  issue of this is that when an accident takes place, the carriages are force close together, the doors are then shut, & the stoves being overturned, or the crushed-in end of the carriages brought in contact with them, the train is in a few minutes in flames. But as the Americans have more than thirty eight thousand miles of railway at work, which is more than three times as much as we have in the United Kingdom, they are entitled to a good many accidents. My own experience, but it is limited to eight thousand miles is in favour of the safety of American Railway travelling. No train I was in ever met met with an accident. The only delay I ever had to submit to was caused by a luggage train a-head having crashed a rail. And the delay of four hours was not altogether wasted time, for besides giving one an opportunity for taking a walk in an American forest, it was the cause of over hearing the following piece of wisdom; \"There are two things a man ought to bear well: what he can help, & what he can not help\"; & the following specimen of infantile..."},{"pageid":59015,"pagefilename":"edcb166fd5991dbe309002030dda4c5e.jpg","transcription":"180\n...American. \"Mother!

On some occasions before I had spoken a word I was addressed as an Englishman. I could not imagine  what it was that reveled my nationality.

It once happened - it was between Gordonsville & Richmond - that a gentleman in the train even went still further by divining at a glance not only my nationality, but also that I was a clergyman, for he began, \"I suppose, Sir, I am addressing an English Clergyman.\" I was puzzled; & I could only be certain that it was not my dress that had enabled him to make the discovery. The single point at which their sagacity was ever at fault appeared to be the motive which had induced me to undertake so long a journey. (of course I am only speaking of the persons one casually meets in a railway car) In the South, & up the Mississippi I frequently heard the supposition that I had come across the water to establish some kind of business. On the Prairies I was supposed to be speculating in land; in the Rocky Mountains to have an eye to gold-mining. But to go back to the original point. I was once told what it was that had betrayed me on the particular occasion, & to that particular gentleman.

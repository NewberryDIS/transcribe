The next morning I found fifty two things mentioned on the bill of fare for breakfast. Luncheon, tea, & supper are also supplied to its guests by this establishment.

It is possible that, by a singular sum of good luck, I may have always been at a warm place, when the weather was cold elsewhere, but it is literally true that during the winter I never once had occasion to put on an overcoat, excepting when I was in Canada at its breaking up. I left New York early in January, went through the south where I gathered ripe oranges from the trees on which they were hanging; ascended the Mississippi; crossed the Prairies & Plains to the Rocky Mountains, at the foot of which I found the thermometer at Denver standing at 70 degrees; recrossed the Prairies to Chicago; & during the whole of this time, whether on foot, or in a railway car, or on or in a coach, did not on any occasion find the weather disagreeable on account of the cold; though I frequently found it in railway cars, and in Hotels very much warmer than was agreeable.

And so when we walk through the streets of a city larger than most European Capitals, & find none of the buildings we are in the? habit of seeing everywhere else, we condemn it as architecturally poor.  This feeling is increased in New York by the fact that there is nothing very striking in Broadway, its main Street, except its length.  The shops, or stores as they are called, are rendered externally quite ineffective by the narrowness of their frontage, & by the way in which they are converted into an advertizing frame for names, & announcements of various kinds.

All its districts\nhave much the same productions; the result of which is the minimum \nof home trade.  How enormous must be the differences which must result\nto Italy & ourselves from this dissimilarity in our respective circumstances!  I apply\nthis to the United States of America.  The cause which has contributed so\nmuch to make us wealthy, intelligent, & commercial is to be found in\nthe United States - with the difference, however, that what has been done\nhere on a very small scale is there done, & has yet to be done on an\nenormous scale.

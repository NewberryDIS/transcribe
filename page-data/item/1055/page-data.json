They style themselves Principal Chiefs of the Cherokee Nation, from Fort Gibson. They say they have fumbled at the fort in accordance with an invitation from Gen. Arbuckle, commandant of the United States troops in that quarter, to take into consideration matters of the greatest importance to the peace & prosperity of their nation. They announce that they have received information that three of their people, or three Cherokees who have been received as ciitzens of their nation, have been killed, and,  it is believed, by some of the late emigrants. This has caused them much sorrow & distress. They learn, further, that other Cherokees are threatened with death, wholly, or principally, for their political acts. They say this is not all they have to complain of. They state that if would appearfrom a communication made by John Ross & other principal men of the the late emigrants, to Gen: Storkes, Cherokee Agent, on the 21st of June, that the late emigrants have called, what they denominate, a convention of the Cherokee nation, unclear... of July, to establish a government for the Cherokee nation; and without giving the uniters the least notice upon the subject.

They had believed that this  kind & just treatment on their past, would have been received in the spirit in which it was offered, and that if their present form of government was not altogether satisfactory to their brethren late from the east, they would, at an early period, have an opportunity of fully sharing in that government, when the desired change might be made.-The writer declare they wish nothing \"not clear\" & friendship from their brethren late from the east; but that, as  it appears they are not satisfied, and that mischief has already taken place, in the hope  & wish to spare the further shedding of Cherokee blood, they will agree to meet their eastern brethren on the following terms:- that no Cherokee shall  be hereafter killed for former political acts or opinions:- that a convention shall be held at Fort Gibson, in which both parties shall be equally referenced; which convention shall have power to remodel the government for the Cherokee nation.- The writer disclaim any write to dictate, or arbitrarily to determine, the number of which the proposed convention shall consist; but they believe that sixteen men from each party, of good understanding and approved character, would be sufficient to form a constitution calculated to harmonize  & re-unite the whole Cherokee people and to elect a President.  They sincerely believe that the acceptance of these propositions will re-establish peace & confidence & greatly promote the people's happiness & prosperity.  They will be much gratified if their eastern brethren accept these just & reasonable propositions; but if they do not; and determine on appealing to arms, however much the writer may deplore the shedding of more Cherokee blood, and the disasters of such a conflict, they & their friends must meet it, and they will, as men unwilling to surrender their own rights, is to invade the rights of others.- They say if it is their good fortune to hear that these propositions, however uncalled for, are accepted by their eastern friends, they would propose that the convention meet at Fort Gibson, on the 25th day of July.

They have no wish to trample on their laws, nor to disregard their rights: as a proof that they  entertain no such disposition, they have not availed themselves of the advantages of their superior numbers in their intercourse with them. When they refused to mingle community with them for free conversation on their affair, & requested that their wishes might be reduced to writing, they offered to meet them on equal ground; but their just and reasonable \"not clear\" were unconditionally rejected and their communication treated with contempt.

McCall had gone to Camp Illinois to seek all possible information concerning the reports of Indian hostilities that quarter.  He called at the residence of John Ross & delivered his credentials.  He found many of the principal men lately arrived in that country, with Mr Ross.  Mr. Ross said that the object of Capt McCall's mission had just been talked over among them; that they were most desirous of a thorough investigation; but that, as the persons then with him had assembled for the purpose of settling the accounts of the conducters of detachments of the late emigrants, paying claims, &  it would greatly inconvenience many Cherokees should the meeting be adjourned and this important business postponed, which must be the case if Mr Ross should leave home at that moment.  He regretted the impediment but immediately appointed Judge Adair and Mr. Stephen Foreman for that service.  Capt. McCall praises them as men of intelligence, and active in sifting the matter thoroughly and ascertaining every fact.  At Camp Illinois they desired Lieut: Hammond to send for the person who had informed him of the intended hostilities.  John Mosely, a Cherokee residing near the Camp was produced before the commissioners in presence of the officer.  He said he had given his information to prevent hostilities.  He wished his name not to be mentioned excepting to Gen: Arbuckle & John Ross, until after a thorough investigation; because John Nicholson, on of the Cherokees implicated, would shoot him if told that he had informed.  He said this John Nicholson three or four weeks previously passed the night at his house.  He then spoke much of the situation of the Cherokees.  He declared himself in favor of suppressing the sale of whiskey.

They announce that they have received information that three of their people, or three Cherokees who have been received as ciitzens of their nation, have been killed, and,  it is believed, by some of the late emigrants. This has caused them much sorrow & distress. They learn, further, that other Cherokees are threatened with death, wholly, or principally, for their political acts. They say this is not all they have to complain of. They state that if would appearfrom a communication made by John Ross & other principal men of the the late emigrants, to Gen: Storkes, Cherokee Agent, on the 21st of June, that the late emigrants have called, what they denominate, a convention of the Cherokee nation, unclear... of July, to establish a government for the Cherokee nation; and without giving the uniters the least notice upon the subject.

They had believed that this  kind & just treatment on their past, would have been received in the spirit in which it was offered, and that if their present form of government was not altogether satisfactory to their brethren late from the east, they would, at an early period, have an opportunity of fully sharing in that government, when the desired change might be made.-The writer declare they wish nothing \"not clear\" & friendship from their brethren late from the east; but that, as  it appears they are not satisfied, and that mischief has already taken place, in the hope  & wish to spare the further shedding of Cherokee blood, they will agree to meet their eastern brethren on the following terms:- that no Cherokee shall  be hereafter killed for former political acts or opinions:- that a convention shall be held at Fort Gibson, in which both parties shall be equally referenced; which convention shall have power to remodel the government for the Cherokee nation.- The writer disclaim any write to dictate, or arbitrarily to determine, the number of which the proposed convention shall consist; but they believe that sixteen men from each party, of good understanding and approved character, would be sufficient to form a constitution calculated to harmonize  & re-unite the whole Cherokee people and to elect a President.  They sincerely believe that the acceptance of these propositions will re-establish peace & confidence & greatly promote the people's happiness & prosperity.  They will be much gratified if their eastern brethren accept these just & reasonable propositions; but if they do not; and determine on appealing to arms, however much the writer may deplore the shedding of more Cherokee blood, and the disasters of such a conflict, they & their friends must meet it, and they will, as men unwilling to surrender their own rights, is to invade the rights of others.- They say if it is their good fortune to hear that these propositions, however uncalled for, are accepted by their eastern friends, they would propose that the convention meet at Fort Gibson, on the 25th day of July.

The General thinks it indeed singular, after having been requested by Mr Ross in letter of June 22d & 23d, to interpose by force and otherwise, to prevent the further effusion of blood in the Cherokee nation,- that his interposition should now be complain-ed of, and without the assignment of any justifiable cause.

Last night Mrs. Ellis and Mrs Crewdson sat up again.  The night before we had no one with us till midnight when Mrs Singleton came.  We think we will not need any watches from this time.  Those who have little children have been afraid to come to the house, fearing diphtheria.  We think it is not that for if were, others would be coming down by this time.  I seem to be the same that a little girl had who died last week, just about time, or perhaps a day before Roberts came down.  Mrs Crewdson lives in rooms in which two other families live. - one of them having a little girl about a year older than Roberts.  Mrs C's husband is away just now at their ranch and so she was alone.  When her neighbor who has the little girl heard of her sitting up here Sunday night she sent word requesting her not to come back to her rooms for awhile.  As Mrs. C could remain away, she has done so, staying with Mrs. Ellis.

He would not take his medicine, and they forced him to receive it.  Without it the doctors both said he could not have survived till morning.  They were with us two nights and Mrs. Singleton two or parts of two.  We were very grateful to them.  There are many others that we could have depended on, but it seems that most of the families have children.  But we hope it was nothing contagious.\nThe school will be closed for the week.  There is so much sickness all around. - much sore throat and grip and pneumonia. - though just here there has not been so much pneumonia.\nWe are pretty well, the rest of us.

I learn the stuff fast but forget it twice as fast.\nI came down here to the library so as to escape the big celebration out at the U. It ought to be about over by now.\nI will enclose the letter from Zaidee. I am glad she is interested in the affair and I really do not believe we are bleeding the boys by taking a ten each month. I feel sure we can count on the 20 00 each month. I find my money goes very, very fast!

Just one now and then.\nI spent some money for something else this morning - 3 00 for the University Concert Course. To go to any one of them would cost 3 00 and there is one? of the five that I would pay 3 00 to hear - Ignaz Friedman, pianist. Many from the school of music in Washburn went to Lawrence two years ago to hear him. There are five of them which make the admission only 60 ¢ each. \nAm getting powerfully no not so sleepy - as I am hungry! So will stop and eat.

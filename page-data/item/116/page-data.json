EVERETT, Pastor.\nKiowa, Kansas  Jan 18, 1889\nMy Dear Aunts: -\nRoberts continues to improve.  We hope that he is getting upon a firm footing once more.  Last night Mrs. Ellis and Mrs Crewdson sat up again.  The night before we had no one with us till midnight when Mrs Singleton came.  We think we will not need any watches from this time.  Those who have little children have been afraid to come to the house, fearing diphtheria.  We think it is not that for if were, others would be coming down by this time.  I seem to be the same that a little girl had who died last week, just about time, or perhaps a day before Roberts came down.  Mrs Crewdson lives in rooms in which two other families live. - one of them having a little girl about a year older than Roberts.  Mrs C's husband is away just now at their ranch and so she was alone.  When her neighbor who has the little girl heard of her sitting up here Sunday night she sent word requesting her not to come back to her rooms for awhile.  As Mrs. C could remain away, she has done so, staying with Mrs. Ellis.  We expected only one of them last night, but they decided"},{"pageid":28398,"pagefilename":"24f7e1f17c71b778f437831a6bcf35a6.jpg","transcription":"that they would both come and give us a full night's sleep, thinking that we would then be able to get along without help in the future.  They have been of great help to us than we can express.  Sunday night they attended to him faithfully and efficiently that we believe they saved his life.  He would not take his medicine, and they forced him to receive it.  Without it the doctors both said he could not have survived till morning.  They were with us two nights and Mrs. Singleton two or parts of two.  We were very grateful to them.  There are many others that we could have depended on, but it seems that most of the families have children.  But we hope it was nothing contagious.\nThe school will be closed for the week.  There is so much sickness all around. - much sore throat and grip and pneumonia. - though just here there has not been so much pneumonia.\nWe are pretty well, the rest of us.  Though Ella is pretty well worn out and I may say about sick.\nMrs. Crewdson has just returned with a basket of apples and oranges and bananas and nuts and candy together with a can of jam from Mrs. Ewell for Roberts.  Mrs. Eikes a daughter about Howard's age, and, and has not been here at all, but has sent words that she would like to have been.\nWe hope you are well. - Cousin Mary Lewis is tracing up the lost package.

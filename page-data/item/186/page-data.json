James H. Hobbs to N.K.\nHuntsville Arkansas April 18, 1850\nMr. Kendall\nDear Sir:-\nPerhaps you have looked for a letter from me and wondered why I did not write, and have thought for a moment that I had forgotten my promise, or that that respect and love that I now have and ever have had since our first acquaintance, for you had waxed cold. The reason that I have not written, unclear because I have forgotten you! Forget the many pleasant moments that we have spent together in the capacity of teacher and student and also socially? Forget the rambles we have taken near the pleasant village of Mt. Washington seeking some of those pure streams of water whose meandering course finds their way over those high rocks! All these things forgotten: No,Sir,ungrateful indeed would I be to let such moments of pleasure pass by unnoticed and unappreciated. Those b books which you taught me to peruse by being absent from me may be forgotten. Mythology, Aesops Fables and other parts of Latin may slip the memory but those lessons that I received at your room when the flickering taper supplied the great luminary of day I would be thrice happy could I call it the same waythat I have in by gone days: Miss Kendall no less natural sounds her name and memory wanders back and tells me that I wasa student also of hers, that lesson after lesson, and instruction after instruction I have heard fall from her lips. \nWhile these things are flickering across my mind the thought arises\"Where am I\". Am I in such a country as you are;where prosperity, happiness and pleasure may attend all, or am I in a country where these things are not known. Really I know not how to answer the question for I never have been at any place where the people enjoyed themselves better than here. I am n near the Red Man's home and now and then we can see the squaws carrying such packs as they do. The smoke of their wigwarms may be seenassending which seems to tell the doleful tale that the tribe will soon be extinct.\nIn my imagination I see you going up to the Academy and after you have got there I see you figuring around as though your whole soul was ingaged,imparting instruction and building a foundation for many pupils that may lead them to future happiness, prosperity and renown. God bless the Teacher,Though he's bothered,perplexed and harrassed by his bad pupils there is a pleasure arising from a consciousness of doing good. I have the honor to be the principal of the Huntsville School and think that I am getting along very well. I know not how much longer I will teach school as I expect to comment the practice of law before a great while.\nTell my brother and his family , howdy. Present my kindest love to all friends and reserve the same\nyours truly, \nJames

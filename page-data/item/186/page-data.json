I am determined, however, not to turn aside or go back. As to \"Pleasure,\" in what can it be had, if not in this, if \"Virtue accompany is? I may yet get lost, in the mazes of \"Ignorance,\" or bound in her \"chains\" or I may yet"},{"pageid":42770,"pagefilename":"45a056dbbf9459967c91bf533e5e22a4.jpg","transcription":"go down the stream of \"Insignificance\" and be buried in the gulf of Oblivion; but if I do, I promise you it shall not be in consequence of \"Indolence.\" Yet, let is always bear in mind that \"Science may raise one to eminence; but Virtue alone can ensure us felicity.\" May we, I say bear this in mind & let virtue be our constant companion.\n\n            Please - accept my thanks for the solution of that problem.

In my former trials I had x equal one term, then when I added them together there were two unknown quantities in the equation. I then tried to work it by substituting the value of X, for X. but on multiplying together it produced an equation, which in my present stage of Algebraic knowledge I could not reduce, (if it can be reduced), at all. It never occurred to me (yo will wonder at my dullness) that X could be anything else.

Last winter as you know, I kept two amounting to 5 months, both of them coming under rather unfavorable omens, but both terminating satisfaction only to myself, and as near as I can learn, to others. I suppose that long ere this you have heard of the death of our mutual friend B. A. Snow. I was not aware of his being dangerously ill until I heard of his death, though I knew that he left school in April on account of ill health. Although 5 miles distant, I hear the bell ring for school at the Academy almost daily, Mr. Goldsbury, I understand, has upwards of 40 scholars would that I were one. It would do me good to see you, but I fear that I shall not very soon, if ever; yet I hope to hear from you (yet) again. I desire to know of your prosperity, your employment, your enjoyment etc.. I would congratulate you in your progress up the hill of science, and shall try to follow as far as I can in my situation. Finally, Brother Kendall, I wish you success in every undertaking, (you will not undertake anything wrong of course), and all the happiness you can enjoy in this world. Yours in Friendship, B. L.

But, as that pleasure is forbidden me I will improve the only substitute for it, and I hope it will be as acceptable to you as it is agreeable to me. In the first place I will give you an inkling of my present situation. I am in my second school and have been here a little more than two weeks. Not exactly in the Mount Caeser School, but in the same district, and with some of the former pupils of Mt. C. Seminary.\nI have about 45 scholars, embracing, of course, a great variety of dispositions, habit, propensities, etc. We find, you know, some who have been indulged by mistaken parents in almost every childish whim, -- some, who have been debarred from even innocent amusement, --Some who have been taught that money is the root of all good and must procured at all events, -- Some in fact of every possible description (almost) and all our talent for government, all our knowledge of human nature must be exercised. And not only does the teacher have the numerous & conflicting dispositions of his pupils to encounter, but, what is often worse, those of nearly as many parents."},{"pageid":42796,"pagefilename":"c387fd077732cae56470e7d5e1b75505.jpg","transcription":"Too often is it the case that, when the child takes a little offence he is encouraged by his parents. to disobey again and this is a fruitful source of more mischief.\n    I would not have you to infer that such is the case here more than in many other places, I was speaking of a too common evil.  My first school this season consisted of (only) 15 scholars, all of whom--or nearly all, --apparently tried to do their best.  In a school so disposed as that, whatever might be the number, one could not but enjoy himself.\n Now much more pleasant is a school where the pupils govern themselves from a sense of propriety, than one where they have no principle of good and where learning is but a secondary object.\n With regard to my own progress, & improvements, I must say that it has not been so great as in some times past.\n\nSince I entered the school-room again I have had as much labor both for the body & mind, as I was able to perform.\n\n Consequently I have not engaged in any particular branch of study this winter.\n But, though I am not getting \" a handle \" so fast as I should like let me assure you, it is not in consequence of indolence.\nBy the way, as I am but, a few roads from Mt. C. Sem. I will just remark that the Institution has got rather low. Last Spring they had no school at all; last fall, only one of about 6 weeks, with 15 or 20 scholars. The cause it is there was some disagreement among the trustees, and the Universalist Association withdrew their patronage, and dissolved their connection with it.

Kendall, will not be wearied with the repetition if I again revert to the pleasure derived from the works of nature. Here are pleasures free for all. How many there are who pay tens, hundreds, and even thousands of dollars for choice paintings, the work of art. But I who cannot do this can feast my eyes on pictures painted by nature. Yes all have this privilege literally without money & without price. But do all avail themselves of it? Do all enjoy it who might? No. Some there are, -- and such are to be pitied, -- who can pass their 'three score years & ten' without discovering anything beautiful in nature; -- Some there are who, if they cannot see the shining dollars, or what will produce them, cannot see anything worth seeing. When they see a beautiful tree they only think how many feet of boards it will make, and how much it will \"come to.\"\nWhen they see a waterfall they only think as did one on a visit to Niagara, \"What an almighty sight of mills that water would carry\" and he sorely lamented the loss of the water.

That must depend in a measure upon our past lives. If the reflections of the past are pleasant, if we are rightly improving the present we are happy. But if on the contrary the past bring naught but thoughts of sadness, if the present is unimproved our share of happiness is small. It often witnesses the formation of bright hopes and fond anticipations of future happiness, which are as unlikely to be unrealized as those which we have already cherished and seen withering in decay. But the future is yet to come, and what does it contain? Who can tell? Who can pierce its dark vail and reveal its hidden mysteries? No mortal arm has strength sufficient fore such a task. No mortal eye can pierce the vail and see what lies beyond. Each day as it rolls onward realizes to us some dream of happiness or disappoints some long cherished hope.

She was introduced to Charles VII, she offered to raise the seige of Orleans and conduct the prince to Reims to be crowned, at the same time demanding for herself a consecrated sword that had for a long time hung in the Church of St. Catherine. Her request was granted and she at the head of her army entered triumphant the city of Orleans, and appeared in a splendid armour at the coronation of Charles which took place in the Cathedral of Reims. She then though her mission done and sought to retire to private life, but  but finally yielded to the public wish and and remained in public life.

First as to numbers.  There are at present 3 male schools each containing from 25 to 30 scholars ?.  The terms vary from 6$ to 15 $ per session, tho my terms are 7 1/2-10-12 1/2 $. \n\nI commenced in October, after both the other schools had been some time in operation, and with but 8 scholars.

The building is of brick, two rooms about 20 ft square with a passage between or an acre lot near the center of the town. The gent. who occupies the seminary is by some coincidence rather negligent  & does not exercise proper discipline.\n\n                            The Trustees charge 70$ per session for the use of the building, they say to keep it in repairs But should I get it, I hope to have the privilege of expanding whatever they may charge in such improvements as I may think proper.\n             Altho' the first session might not be very numerously attended yet I thunk a most excellent school might be built up. I know of no village of 1500 or 2,000 inhabitants where a more desirable opening is presented.

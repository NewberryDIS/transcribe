These traditions or legends in the lapse of time are subject to many changes, and almost necessarily receive some fresh embellishments from each new narrator. And although each of them may have been founded on facts, so prone is the Indian mind to weave in something of the marvellous and supernatural with every transaction of their lives, that it becomes a matter of no astonishment to find their accounts of known facts so blended with the miraculous, as to cast a shade of doubt over the whole narration. Yet are they received with implicit faith by the Indian, and the very Interpolator who has drawn freely from his own imagination to make some old legends the more interesting, comes in time to believe the fictions of his own coinage.\nThe following legend, or tale, I picked up somewhere amongst the Ojibways during my residence amongst them; it matters not how or when; and believing that the ingenious stratagems of the two principal actors, and the view that it gives of some of the superstitions of the tribe render it worthy of publication, I herewith present it to the public without further excuse.\nIsh-pau-bi-kau    gia    Wau-bish-kizzi Muk-kwah.\nHigh Rock     and the     White           Bear\nMany years ago there lived a great hunter named Ish-pau-bi-kau, or the High Rock; he grew so expert in all kinds of hunting, that he would start out in the morning from his lodge, without any weapon, and never returned without meat for his family.\nOne evening a number of old warriors and young braves were sitting around the fire; the old men were telling tales of their youthful days, and the young men were listening with respectful attention.

All the young men\nwere busy making ornaments to decorate their persons for the great \nmedicine dance; Ish-pau-bi-kau said: “I will go and catch a grey eagle\nand make myself a head-dress with his feathers.” He started out with\nno weapon but his knife; then the young men said, “how will he catch\nan eagle?” We cannot even get near enough to shoot them: “But Ish-pau-bi-kau\nknew what he was about.\n\tHe first directed his steps towards a tamarack swamp, where\nthousands of white rabbits might be seen frisking about, at all hours\nof the day; pulling some strips of smitten bark, he soon manufactured \na snare, and setting it in his own ingenious manner, he captured a \nlarge rabbit alive in a very short time: tying the rabbit to his belt he\nleft the swamp, and turned his steps across the wide prairie towards\na high rock where the eagles built; the same rock from which he\nderived his name, in consequence of its being the scene of some\ndistinguished exploit of his youth.\n\tAnd now he began his preparations for catching the grey eagle;\ntaking his knife, he commenced digging up the soft sand of the prairie,\nuntil he had made a long trench, about eighteen inches in depth, and\nof length and width sufficient to allow him to lie down in it, stretched\nout at full length on his back;  then collecting a quantity of grass, he\nfixed himself in his trench and covered himself so completely with \nthe grass, that, at a few paces distant, no one could have been aware\nof his presence.\n\tHe now let out his rabbit, keeping fast hold of its leg, that \nits struggles might attract the attention of the Eagles, intending\nwhen the eagle should swoop on its prey, to grapple with it, and\nthen victory would rest with the strongest.\n\tSuddenly the rabbit is struck whirling into the air, and the \nastonished hunter removing his eyes from the eagles on top of the\ncliff, to his own more immediate vicinity, beholds standing over him\nan immense white bear, apparently contemplating with great\n\n                                                        2                                                  ms814"},{"pageid":62258,"pagefilename":"d93756c1964cba6fde05fe49cc1047e5.jpg","transcription":"4\ncuriousity, the exposed hand of the hunter which still grasps one\nleg of the unfortunate rabbit.\n\tIsh-pau-bi-kau instinctively closed his eyes, and feigned the\ndeath which he had every reason to believe would soon be his\nportion. Meanwhile the bear was making further researches; he\nsoon removed all the grass with which Ish-pau-bi-kau had\ncovered himself, and placing one of his huge paws under the\nhunter’s body, he tossed him out of the trench with as much ease\nas he had jerked the rabbit from his hand. Ish-pau-bi-kau lay \nin the same position in which he fell, he never moved a muscle,\nand whilst the bear was smelling his mouth and nose, to see if he \nbreathed, and was tossing him about from side to side, he counterfeited\ndeath so perfectly, that the bear was almost convinced he\nbeheld before him nothing but a lifeless carcass. Nevertheless he was\nnot entirely convinced, so, walking off some thirty or forty paces he\nconcealed himself behind a group of the large gopher hills which \nare so common on the western prairies. From this position he would\nreconnoitre every few moments the body of the Indian which still \nlay in the same position in which it has fallen last, as motionless\nas through life had been extinct for a century.\n\tNevertheless Ish-pau-bi-kau had raised his eyelids sufficiently\nto enable him to observe the motions of the bear; he could see\nthe head of the bear appearing at short intervals from behind the gopher \nhill, and after taking a short observation it would be again withdrawn.\nHe observed that the intervals between these motions of the bear’s head, \ngradually increased in length, and once when at least fifteen minutes\nhad elapsed without the head appearing.\n\tAnd now Ish-pau-bi-kau determined to make an effort\nThe Ojibways believe that the grisly bear will not defile himself\nby feasting on, or even mutilating a dead body; hence the reason\nwhy the bear we are writing of, is so anxious to ascertain whether\nthe hunter is alive or not.

It might have been a half\nhour before the bear again looked out from his hiding place, and a \nfew bounds brought him to the place where he had last seen the\nbody; here taking the track of Ish-pau-bi-kau, he was soon in full\npursuit. and when the hunters entered the tamarack swamp, the\nbear was close at his heels. Ish-pau-bi-kau had just reached the top-most\nbranches of a large tamarack tree, when the bear took up his \nposition at its roots.\n\tUnlike his black brethren, the white bear is no climber and\nIsh-pau-bi-kau was now beyond his reach; but determined not to \nbe cheated of his prey, he immediately commenced digging and \nknawing the roots of the tree. A short time sufficed to bring down\nthe tree with a crsh, but the disappointed bear perceived with \nchagrin that Ish-pau-bi-kau had caught the limb of another tree\nand was still beyond his reach; and so closely grew the tamaracks,\nthat if the bear felled the one the Indian occupied, it was certain in\nfalling to carry him right into the branches of another. \n\tThe bear now resumed his old tactics; walking some distance\nfrom the occupied tree, he laid down in a place concealed from the view\nof the Indian, and where by poking his head out from time to time, he\ncould observe all that was going on. Ish-pau-bi-kau now commenced\nconstructing from the small branches of the tamarack  am image as much like \nhis own form as possible, and with the assistance of his belt, breechclout\nand head dress he soon had a figure that at a distance would closely resemble\na man. Waiting his opportunity when the bear have been taking an\nobservation, and had again withdrawn his head, Ish-pau-pi-kau fixed\nthe image in his place, and gliding swiftly down the tree, again trusted\nto his speed to save his life. Unfortunately the very means he had\ntaken to secure his escape, became the cause of a speediest pursuit by \nthe bear; a slight gust of wind shook the image from its position and"},{"pageid":62260,"pagefilename":"69ccc8c8d607f377ff3df9017ed8d155.jpg","transcription":"6\ndown it came to the ground. Instantly the bear had it in his grasp, \nand detecting the cheat, hastened to the foot of the tree, took Ish-pau-bi-kau’s\ntrail and was away in pursuit of the fugitive, who was\nscarcely half a mile in advance.\n\tIsh-pau-bi-kau’s course brought him to the shore of a small lake\nin the centre of the tamarack swamp; he reached the shore at a point where\nhe had once found and taken a bee tree, and a piece of the large hollow \nbranch, about twelve feet long was still lying where he had left it; Into this\nhe had just time to crawl, when his pursuer reached the spot.\n\tThe aperture through the centre of the log, though large enough\nto admit a man, would not so much as let in the head of a white bear;\nSo Bruin after rolling the log over several times, exerting his prodigious\nstrength, grasped it round the centre and waded with it into the lake; \nrunning one end of the log as far beneath the surface as he was able to\nforce it, he looked up at the other end, and there was the head and \nshoulders of Ish-pau-bi-kau exposed to sight. Instantly reversing the \nlog, he immersed the other end, and looking up again, he obtained a\nsight of the feet and legs of Ish-pau-bi-kau, who though unable to turn \naround, had climbed up feet foremost until he got from under the \nwater and reached the air.\n\tAfter repeating this manoeuvre until he was satisfied he could\neffect nothing, the bear laid the log down on the water, and getting on top\nof it, his immense weight sunk it far beneath the surface. After keeping\nit in this position long enough to drown a pearl diver, had one been in\nIsh-pau-bi-kau’s place, the bear took a look into one end of the log, and \nto his astonishment found it empty; whilst far out in the centre of the \nlake, he soon after discovered Ish-pau-bi-kau apparently as much in\nhis element as a young duck; at swimming both on, and beneath the\nsurface of the water, Ish-pau-bi-kau had not his equal in the tribe.\n\tThe bear now abandoned the log and swam off in pursuit. Ish-pau-bi-kau\nwould permit him to approach almost near enough to \nreach him, and then diving would invariably re-appear in precisely\nthe opposite direction from that in which the bear would be waiting\nfor him.

So, to work he went, and tearing away the stakes\nand brush which the industrious beavers had laid up with so much \ncare and skill, the flood, small and feeble at first, soon began to assist\nhis labors, until at length it was rushing down the stream, a perfect\ntorrent, sweeping everything before it, in its headlong course. Ish-pau-bi-kau\nsoon became aware of what was going on, by the motion of the water,\nand as quickly determined on the course to pursue; he dived\ndeep below the surface of the lake and guided by the swift current passed\nout into the stream, almost under the nose of the bear, who perched up\non a fallen tree which formed one of the abutments of the dam, was intently\nwatching the centre of the lake.\n\tLong before the water had all ran out of the lake, Ish-pau-bi-kau \nwas several miles down the stream, and as soon as he reached\nthe spot where the stream leaving the tamarack swamp, flows out into \nthe prairie, he left its channel and started to fly, rather than run,\nacross the wide prairie that spread out between himself and the\nvillage. When he had accomplished about half the distance across\nthe prairie he ventured to look over his shoulder, at the very moment\nwhen his indefategable enemy was leaving the swamp, and\nentering the border of the prairie.\n\tAnd now he felt that it was indeed a race for life; although\nhe had but half the distance to accomplish which must be traversed\nby the bear, yet he knew that the speed of the bear was double that \nof his own.

The bear apparently \nas much excited as the man, almost reaching him at every bound,\nlooked neither to the right nor left, and seemed totally unconscious \nof the presence of a human being, with the single exception\nof the one he so obstinately pursued.

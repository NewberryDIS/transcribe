They work mostly oxen.

As a further inducement for me to stop, he informed me that I might have his daughter for a partner, pointing to her as she entered to call him to supper.\nCurious to gaze upon her. She was I judge about sixteen, dark, quadroon- quarter Indian, medium height and somewhat pretty. She was the very personification of retired simplicity, gay but modest, no intellectual refinement could be discerned. Hearing her fathers words, and his question, if she would not consent, I noticed a perceptible blush and at the same time she gave me an evasive answer. The old man did not like it, he demanded a peremptory answer, but she was equally as resolute and the only answer he received was a quick and silent retreat from the shop, much to my relief. Having settled with the old man for his work, I took my departure with the promise that I would call again, and one that I never fulfilled.\n\n The settlement of Selkirk extends for the length of about eighty miles on Red River and about forty miles on the Assinniboin.

Many of the settlers during the summer pay a visit and camp out at Lake Winnipeg, distant forty-miles from Ft. Garry, where they procure an abundance of water game.

They have a very large and fine Cathederal on the opposite side of the river from Fort Geary, being the seat of the bishoprick of the District.

From Mr. Pambrun, who could talk their language fluently and who acted as our interpreter, they learned where we were from and to where we were bound. They seemed much surprised that such a small party should undertake such a trip.  As the chief made us a present, he of course expected on in return, which we gave in the shape of tobacco.  We invited the chief and one or two others to sup with us, and we feasted with them pork and beans, with which they seemed delighted, especially the beans. After supper, we circulated the pipe, taking a few whiffs, and then passing it on to the next, and so on, until the pipe was empty. They appeared much pleased with our sociability, and when they retired, the Chief appointed venerable old man to stay in our camp all night to watch any of the young braves that came around, and to see that nothing was stolen from us.

Mr. Pambrun's course from Fort Pitt was north to Red Deer Lake. on our way back, we called at the Fort and seeing several bushels of potatoes, which had been raised there, (latitude about 53 degrees North) we induced Mr. Simpson to part with a bushel, charging us only a shilling, which is about twenty-two cents in American money, very reasonable, much more so than in the States. Money is so scarce in this country, that when they get a sight of a shilling, they are willing to part with almost anything to gain possession of it. Shouldering our potatoes, we moved for the boat and found it in waiting. The boat was large enough to carry all of our chattels, and carts too.

During the night, we were constantly kept awake and annoyed by the Indians, our camp being literally surrounded. Some of the old men staid in camp all night and notwithstanding that we kept a sharp look out, yet we found several small things missing in the morning. The countless numbers of dogs they had with them made night hideous with their discordant howls, they would steal our loose moccasins, and eat them, destroy our animal gear, and everything in the shape of leather or skin that they could lay their voracious fangs upon was sure to go. The Indians never feed them, and the only remuneration that these poor brutes have for acting as beasts of burden, is the refuse of game killed and offal.

The ascent to the Fort is rather preciptous but when once ascended is a gradual grade. It is situated on the North bank of the Saskatchewan, it is surrounded by hewed log palisade closely jointed and in the form of a Rhomboid. It has towers mounted with small carronades. We called upon Mr. Christie, the Chief Trader of the District and master of the Fort this being his headquarters. His manner during our interview did not favorably impress us. He looked and acted as though he was the \"biggest toad in the puddle.\" Here also we received an introduction to Capt Paliser and Captain Blackiston, British Officers, sent by their Government on an exploring expedition. Capt. Blackiston having finished his labor was making preparations to proceed to Fort Carleton and winter there and expressed his willingness to forward all letters we wished to send, an offer gratefully accepted. We intimated to Mr. Christie our desire of exchanging our carts and oxen for horses, and as he stood in need of both, he promised that he would attend to it on the morrow.

We killed a mess, the meat is rather blackish and tough, they are very small. We also saw a few Rocky Mountain sheep, but could not get a shot.

As we had encountered but little snow from our exit out the Pass to this place, we naturally inferred, that we could proceed to Colville very well, The Master, Mr Linkeater, informed us that we had better make tracks as quick as possible, that it was no uncommon thing for it to snow to the depth of four feet between that place and Colville.

They appear to be very zealous and devout in the performance of their rites, they are strictly honest, and you can lay anything down and leave it, without any fears of it being stolen. If any of them is tempted to steal it, all you have to do is to inform the chief, that some of his men have stolen such an article, and it will be forthcoming in a few minutes. We were presented with a fine mess of dried buffalo meat and about a pound of fresh butter, by the chief, O-Kale-kik-ha-lo-la, the latter article made by his family. It was very creditable butter, and far superior to the rancid trash that is set on the tables of many of the Western hotels.

About eight o'clock, P.M., we should judge, the inmates of the lodges were called together by a violent ringing of a cow-bell. having all assembled in the Chief's lodge, (the one, we were in) prayers was said, and hymns sang in a compound mixture of French, Latin and Indian, taught to them by the Priest.

There is a mound at the terminating point of this bluff, which was pointed out to me as her grave. It is thickly covered with stones, and a well beat trail on the west side. The Indians, whenever they pass the sacred spot look reverentially around, gather a stone, and place it on the mound, they do this to the present day. Talking with an old Indian while in that vicinity, and from whom I gathered the legend, he informed me, that often he has passed the spot and deposited a stone, and but once was his eyes blessed with the sight of Hetokah. She was standing, he says, on the mound, clothed in a snow-white garment, facing the East, and with outstretched arm pointing to the abode of the Great Spirit."},{"pageid":57655,"pagefilename":"72cfcbdee74aadf84374650e6e94ec61.jpg","transcription":"129\nChinese Oath\nDuring a trial of the Chinese murderers at Walla Walla several Celestial witnesses were sworn after the fashion of their country. Several chickens were brought into Court and the following scene took place:\nThe chickens were taken out on the balcony of the Court room and there the six witnesses repaired after each receiving a piece of marked yellow paper about the size of a man's hand. On the railing of the balcony four colored candles - each exactly six inches in length - were lighted on the right and left of which were bundles of therein sticks (I believe they call them Josh sticks) on fire. Soon after all the preliminaries had been satisfactorily arranged, one of the Chinamen stepped forward, and after mumbling over some words - the meaning of which I am ignorant - knelt upon one knee, seized hold of a chicken with one hand and a hatchet with the other, and in a twinkling severed the head. Upon completion of the act he arose and bowed reverentially three times before the burning sticks, which represented Josh, lighted his yellow paper and cast it on the floor and retired. In like manner, they all performed the ceremony of swearing that they would tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth \"So help them Josh!\" The ceremony was very unique and quite interesting."},{"pageid":57656,"pagefilename":"250309a1f97ddde86215b65f01a8b649.jpg","transcription":"Names of the different tribes we passed.\nEast Side Chippewas, Sioux, Salteaux, Burgees, Pillagers, Stonees, Seirzees, Crees, Assinneboines, Blackfeet.\nWest Side,: Kootonais, Pen d'Orielles, Colville, Okanagans, Spegans, Nes Perces, Snakes.

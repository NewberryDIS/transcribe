At noon we overtook the Red River train, homeward bound, they were camped near a lake, waiting for reinforcements as they were afraid of the predatory bunches of Sioux who infested that portion of the country, and who would not spare a train that came in their way, if numerically stronger - the train was composed of half-breds with Red River Carts, a curiosity by the way, being destitute of iron with the exception of the staples in the shafts. They work mostly oxen. From them we procured a little of the \"Red Eye\" which proved salutary in its effects, considering the condition we were then in, having been wet from early dawn and with us prospects of drying soon.

The air was perfectly darkened with them - our poor animals were perfectly frantic, and in spite of the continual switching with a brush, they still clung to us with annoying tenacity, for several miles, and in fact we traveled till about eleven at night in order to get away from the mosquitoes empire. Our animals feeling the effects of hard driving, we concluded to stop, and cut up our tents and cover them with it. Camped on the prairie grass very tall, built smudges with dry grass. The animals laid down and in a measure relieved themselves of the pestilence, as we found that the mosquitoes did not come very low down.

She was the very personification of retired simplicity, gay but modest, no intellectual refinement could be discerned. Hearing her fathers words, and his question, if she would not consent, I noticed a perceptible blush and at the same time she gave me an evasive answer. The old man did not like it, he demanded a peremptory answer, but she was equally as resolute and the only answer he received was a quick and silent retreat from the shop, much to my relief. Having settled with the old man for his work, I took my departure with the promise that I would call again, and one that I never fulfilled.\n\n The settlement of Selkirk extends for the length of about eighty miles on Red River and about forty miles on the Assinniboin. The inhabitants consists principally of French, Scorch, Canadians and South English men. But by far the larger portion are half-breeds and quarterbloods. They cultivate but little, and the largest farm in the settlements cannot boast over twenty acres, as they are by treaty only allowed by the Indians but a very narrow strip on each side of the river.

Many of the settlers during the summer pay a visit and camp out at Lake Winnipeg, distant forty-miles from Ft. Garry, where they procure an abundance of water game. Ducks, geese etc. The settlement has several churches of different denominations, but principally Catholic and Episcopalian. They have a very large and fine Cathederal on the opposite side of the river from Fort Geary, being the seat of the bishoprick of the District. The buildings are all with but few exceptions old fashioned and quaintly built. The population of the whole settlement is estimated at 8000, at this time, they had no press, but now as I am copying my old journal whose pencillings are nearly obliterated, I have been informed that the light of the \"Press\" has dawned upon them.

Pretending to have lost the track of our company we enquired for the nearest house, the eldest spying the absent cattle, remarked that if we would help to drive them up they would take us there, which was their home. Oh, charming rural simplicity, my mind was now confused and chaotic, continually wandering from the Eldorado we had in view to the dusky hue of our fair guides. Amesbury enjoyed himself immensely. Soon, we arrived at the house and the worthy host invited is to sup with them as supper was ready, which was gladly accepted, not because we wanted to refresh the inner man, but still linger as long as possible to our charming ciciones. Our supper consisted of broiled venison steaks, graham bread and milk - good enough for anybody and greatly relished by us. After supper, our host anticipating our wishes, brought forth the jug and we sat down to enjoy ourselves till rather late. We intimated our desire to be shown to the residence of Mr. John Kean as our party were to camp there.

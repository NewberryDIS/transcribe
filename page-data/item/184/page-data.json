Inquired after the man who has the $30,000 to loan - he is an old man about eighty and cannot be persuaded to let his money go out of this country : And is satisfied with 1? per cent - so there is no sight there. After figuring about, I found a man who has been figuring in Western lands for several years past, living in Albany; he already owns some 2000 acres of land near West York on our line of Road. He is going West in about two weeks with several of his friends to purchase more lands. He and his friends want to buy pretty largely. Says if he can buy lands to good advantage he can raise $30,000 at East for lands, and perhaps $50,000.

In thinking the matter over, I believe to sell the lands will be the best operation we can make - then the matter is closed, the bonds are cancelled. We are not paying interest in them, they are also out of the way & a large amount of lands released from the deed of trust. If we have to suffer a share m we better do it in the lands than bonds; And in my opinion it will be much less in the lands than bonds. In this case your credit is left for something else.

They have some capital and want to go into a country partly developed and not into a new country like the far West. I told him we could suit him with most any kind of land he wanted improved or unimproved. Some men may want such farms as ? affords; in that case Rose can sell some of his. If we can get the channel once open in our direction money will come to us much easier.

For years the controversies of the press and the delegates in Congress had become watched by them with keen attention, and the growing acrimony and passions of the agitation with recurrent outbursts of violence and bloodshed had been regarded by them as a state of things that would be controlled or quelled in due time.  The Sentiment of loyalty to the flag and love for the nation was universally and unquestionably dominant in the minds and heart of the army until the winter of 1860-61.  Not until the thought of secession and disunion had become an organized threat did officers of Southern birth begin to examine their own minds and purposes.

Fortunately for the social reputation of the South there were numerous lofty exceptions to the common home aspects of Southern Society which were made by exceptional education elsewhere, and it was from these splendid examples of a ?curated, cultivated, refined and chivalrous manhood that the South was judged by the outside world.

In the South, the dominant social and political leaders had for a longtime realized that in separation, or secession, was to be found the only security of their social structure.

Thus were many incidents to this active life, some amusing and some tragic, few of which I can recall.  We had from one hundred to three hundred recruits in the depot going through the schools of instruction and above a hundred horses for their use.  Among the latter was one named \"Turk\" that was a error to recruits.  He had his own views regarding the proper duration of riding exercises and when that time had expired he could not be persuaded to remain any longer on the field  but would break for the stables like a \"quarter horse\" generally leaving his rider on the ground more or less demoralized.  One day he came out in Merrill's platoon.  When Turk considered that his time was up he made an effort to quit the Irishman who was on his back, but the rider under the terrific exhortations of Merrill clung to him with desperation.  At the end of ten seconds, however, the recruit was seated in the dust near the center of the disturbance while Turk was galloping off to the stables.

There were a few severe struggles but the horse had found his master and apparently submitted.  This seeming acquiescence was however a ruse, probably for deliberation.  Having reached the conclusion that as he could not, in this instance, leave his rider behind, he would take him with him.  he suddenly took the bit with his teeth and left the track on a tangent at the top of his speed for the stables.  A part of the way there ran along the crest of a slope which curved around the head of an arroyo.  As Turk was racing along this he suddenly doubled? like a fox at right angles and Merrill taken off his guard went down the slope in a series of slides and tumbles.

The commend was formed in a hollow square about the whipping post with the officers near the center.  The prisoners were brought in, the orders were read aloud by the adjutant.

The surgeon then examined each and if found able in his opinion to endure the infliction of the sentence taking position one side of the prisoner used a small rawhide whip about a yard long high in the air, the officer of the day counted out? the whip hummed through the air and creased? the back of the man with a purple streak with a drop of blood sometimes at the end of it, the adjutant tallied one underlined, the officer of the day counted two underlined and so on to the end, generally thirty odd blows.

Mounted guards patrolled around the outskirts of our immense herd of oxen which covered several hundred acres when grazing. The men were given their first lessons in picketing their horses.  Tllford myself Jackson? of the Rifles and Lord of the 1st Dragoons each commanded a mounted troop of about 62 men.  Capt. Wood and Lieuts Shipley, Hildt and Walker all of the 3d Infantry commanded the companies of infantry.  Our surgeons were Drs. J.C. McKee and Quinan.  Santille and Gordan came out from the fort in the evening to help us let go of civilization.  The following morning Lieut J.E.B. Stuart of the 1st Cavalry on his way from Sumner's command to Fort Leavenworth stopped and breakfasted with us.  We listened with eager interest to his narrative of the fight, hardships and fatigues that the 1st Cavalry had experienced during this campaign against the Cheyenne.

I never saw him afterward except on the field of battle commanding Southern Cavalry.  On the 10th we made our first organized march to the \"Stranger\" Creek, ten miles.  Our trains when extended on the road occupied half the distance.  This was a day of hard work as is invariably the case with the first day in all extended military movements.  It was my first tour as officer of the guard and I had a busy night.  Just at dark a beautiful dark bay horse with black legs came galloping from the plains directly into my camp and was caught.  He had the appearance of being highly bred beautiful head, splendid nostrils and fine ears and there were old saddle marks on his back.  With him was a thoroughbred setter dog.  The animals had evidently belonged to some sportsman but there was nothing to show that they had been recently used and had probably wandered a long distance--perhaps Indians had got their master.  I appropriated the horse and the dog appropriated me as master at once and afterward always slept at my feet.  I named the horse \"Stranger\" and the dog \"Spot.\"  We remained at this camp over the 11th and Capt. Stanly called in passing from Sumners' returning expedition into the fort.  The ensuing night about 8 o'clock Walker who was officer of the guard was brought into camp on a stretcher bleeding from a broken head.  Col. Chambers sent for me and asked me to take the guard again as there was trouble with about thirty mutinous drunken men, who had been arrested for disorderly conduct.  The Colonel told me to use my own judgement.  I found the prisoners turbulent and refractory and defying the guard which was uncertain what to do."},{"pageid":56836,"pagefilename":"1fdc222e279e3abf640c9c0bdbacf555.jpg","transcription":"13.\nThe trouble was incited by half a dozen very bad men of the infantry who were fresh recruits enlisted in New York and totally undisciplined.  The ring leader was a big ugly ruffian who had struck Walker and nearly killed him.  The guard men were men from the Carlisle depot, well drilled and disciplined on whom I could rely.  The mutineers were yelling loud enough to be heard all over camp.  They had not yet undertaken to escape but seemed determined to raise a general riot.  I did not draw my sabre but used the fore scabbard with the sabre in it.  In less than ten minutes we had half a dozen down and tied and all of the prisoners seated on the ground in a circle with sentinels around them with everything quiet, and this was the last trouble of this kind we had.  On the 12th we made twenty miles to \"Hickory Point\" where we found fine grass and good wood but muddy water.  This had been a battle ground of \"the free state party\" the year before, which might at this distance of time be regarded as the first picket shot of the war which followed five years later.  There were three essentials to the welfare of a column crossing the plains: wood, water and grass at the camping places.  None of them was too plenty, often one, and sometimes two would be missing and for fifty miles on the \"dry route\" all were lacking.  \"The dry route\" was across a big bend of the Arkansas River and in taking it to oasis? a long distance, it was necessary to carry along water for one camp?, the \"bois des Vaches \"or dried \"buffalo chips\" being gathered for fuel.

We were generally up with the dawn and, breakfast soon over, the advance moved out upon the road followed by the train which steadily unwound? from its corrals.  If the conditions were favorable we halted for an hour or more in the middle of the march for the day unsaddled and grazed the horses while we had a light lunch of a biscuit, bits of bacon and half an onion.  Of all vegetables the potato and onion are the most essential on the march.  We generally reached camp from 2 to 4 o'clock in the afternoon and had our dinner toward 6 o'clock.  Where antelope abounded on the plains and ducks or fish in the river we went in quest of them after reaching camp.  We found the old fashioned \"Dutch oven\" the best cooking utensil in existence for general purposes.  A round hole a little larger than the oven was dug in the ground with a little side trench for a draft and in and over the hole the fire was built to cook the dinner.  A favorite dish for breakfast was baked bean, made by first parboiling the beans and then placing them in the oven the previous night in quantity sufficient to half fill it and then sticking several small ?"},{"pageid":56838,"pagefilename":"5f97d4646326681952eb84c88d46b64b.jpg","transcription":"15.\nof bacon into the beans and filling the oven with water.

We always had one essential to the enjoyment of a meal not to be found of equal quality any where else in the world that is, a natural and unfailing appetite.  Chapman who set out from Leavenworth an invalid in an ambulance soon got into the saddle, became hearty and strong and gained thirteen pounds crossing the plains.

I never heard of his being \"stumped\" but once by a subordinate and that was by Lieut Owen Chapman who was now with us.  Some years before Chapman was serving at a post commanded by Col. Sumner who always appeared in uniform coat buttoned to throat at reveilles to receive the reports of his officers.  One morning Chapman did not appear and the colonel sent his orderly for him.

Buffalo appeared in numerous herds grazing northward.  Being officer of the guard I was prevented joining in the chase with several officers who returned empty-handed and with thin horses so fatigued that orders were issued that there should be no chasing of buffalo without special permission.  On the morning of the 26th my company had the advance and Major Carleton was riding with me.

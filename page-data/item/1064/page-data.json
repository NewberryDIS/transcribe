If his object had been to ridicule and degrade it, he could not have made a happier selection of an authority. but if their papal bill be of any authority, this country, lying more than a hundred leagues to the west of the [Azores?], still belongs to Spain; for she has never ceded it to any other sovereign. The author quotes from this very respectable bill, the following words; \"we constitute, ordain and appoint you, your heirs and successors as aforesaid, lords of the same, with full, free, and all manner of, power, authority, and jurisdiction\"; and then proceeds this \"These terms and the practical exposition given to them in all succeeding ages, leave no doubt of the pretension then established, and which have been maintained to our day. The general doctrine was this: The discoverer of a country not previously known to any of the civilized nations of the old world, had a right to take possession, and to establish some token of sovereignty. He then became the rightful owner of all the land within a certain distance of this point.\"- But this is not the doctrine of the papal bill.It does not give this right to every discoverer, nor does it acknowledge the right to arise from the discovery.  The Pope would never have acknowledged such a right of discovery in any heretic. Even with regard to his catholic vassals, who acknowledged his supremacy, it was not the discovery which constituted the title; it was the grant of the Pope which had this effect. If the mere discovery per se conferred the title, there was no necessity to apply to the Pope for his grant. And id the doctrine advanced in that bill, be, as we are told it is, the doctrine which has been maintained to the present day, it will be necessary for the state of Georgia to sustain her claims by unclear a title derived under this bill, or some other from the same source. The truth is that the writer seems not to have perfectly clarified and arranged his own ideas on this subject. He confounds the right of discovery with the other rights, if such they must be called, of a totally distinct character; the right pretended to [have?] derived from the See of Rome as possessing a vicarious dominion"},{"pageid":72358,"pagefilename":"b262c43dc44bf2042552595447b922cc.jpg","transcription":"dominion over the whole earth; and the natural right which all men are supposed to have, to draw a subsistence from any part of the earth (the common gift of God to the human family) which is not occupied by another.\nThe right arising from mere discovery as a substantive right in itself, to be asserted, on that ground alone, against the aboriginal occupants of the newly discovered country, is a right which derives no manner of countenance from any writer of respectable authority. Neither [Grotius?], [Pustendorf?], [Vattel?], nor Locke, nor [Montesquise?], nor [Marteus?], seems to have dreamed of any such right as that which the potentates of Europe have pretended to this country, growing out of the mere right of discovery. It is time that writers on natural law, looking at men in a state of nature and consequently anterior to the formation of political society, hold that each individual has a right to occupy so much of the earth only as is necessary to his own subsistence, and consequently has no right to exclude any other individual from a similar occupancy for the same purpose. But none of them has held that a nation, on the discovery of a country new to them, has a right, on the ground of that discovery, to eject the ancient inhabitants, though they be heathens and hunters.\nNote.

Material changes are being effected without. The whole universe is resuming a different aspect. The fields, woods and hills are becoming disrobed of their rich, and beautiful garments in which they have been attired during the Summer. The flowers which have bloomed in garden, on hillside and glen, cheering the passerby on his way, are fading from our vision, and alas we must forego the exquisite pleasure which it affords us to receive or bestow a  beautiful bouquet. Those pure and holy wishes which can be expressed in so delicate manner with flowers, must now be dispensed with or uttered in words which would fail to make the desired impression. The sick chamber will be more lonely without these bright memorials of absent friends which have truly been likened to \"angel visitants.\" The birds are warbling their farewell notes for they know they must seek a warmer clime. Their songs we will miss which always come to our ears with beauty and loveliness, but the music of their last notes will ring in our ears for a long time. As the fruit with which the trees are loaded and the waving grain ripens, the farmer gathers and stores away for the coming Winter. The picturesque scenes which we have witnessed whenever we have wandered out to contemplate the beauties of nature will not meet our gaze again for a time. Our rambles must also be dispensed with, in fact we must house ourselves up or run the risk of getting frozen or if escaping that, of being shocked with the appearance of our favorite haunts, changed from the most beautiful and enchanting to an apparently leafless waste.

Our reason tells us that it is necessary that this arrangement of things should be as it is in order to effect those results which it is desirable should be effected for man's enjoyment. Therefore when we take into consideration the great end which is accomplished by means of these at first sight unpleasant changes, then it is that we feel not only perfectly resigned to the change, but see many beauties about it that inspire in us feelings kindred to those called forth by the sight of those beautiful scenes which meet our vision when all nature is teeming with life and beauty. The \"blue vaulted canopy of heaven\" with its myriads of stars is still above us upon which to gaze and admire, to study and reflect. At this season of the year it is even more beautiful than at any other for those constellations which have attracted the most attention in all ages of the world are visible and what more interesting or instructive occupation than that by which we learn \"to dive into the depths of infinite space?\" There are more attractions at home at this time of the year for now the long evenings may be rendered very pleasant by all the member of the family gathering around the bright, blazing fire and conversing in a manner not only interesting but instructive.

How delightful the change! We tire of sameness and would not know how to prize so many rich blessings unless deprived of them for a time. The growth and perfection of a plant depends entirely upon the influences by which it is surrounded. The farmer aware of this fact throws around the seed which he places in the ground all those influences which will effect their growth. If he fail to do this he finds that his Autumn is a fruitless one, that instead of being blessed with a rich harvest that his seed has been worse than thrown away, that instead of a plentious board his family are starving for bread. Youth has been compared to Spring and Manhood to Autumn. There is so very striking a resemblance that it cannot fail to be seen by the observer. If anyone neglect in youth to cultivate his mind, to get that instruction which is necessary for the growth and perfection of his mental, moral and affectionate being his Autumn of life will fail to be a pleasant one. He will find alas! too late that in order to have old pleasant that a store of knowledge must be laid up beforehand upon which to feast, that all the passions must be kept in subjection or they will like thorns and thistles root out all the better fruit, but when our bodies, which like all natural substances must undergo decomposition are worn out and laid low then will we like the plants spring forth into a brighter and more lovely existence where there will be no unfavorable influences to retard our progress in a knowledge of all those things which will make us virtuous and happy. \nI.C.

Kings may be good men but it is seldom they are faultless, they forget to \"honor all men\" but contrary to the teachings of Christianity claim that all honor is due one man. Democedes, a Grecian physician of Crotona effected the cure of Darius and through his influence the Egyptian physicians were pardoned for the great crime of not being able to cure the king. Democedes rec'd many magnificent presents for his services on this occasion and having the good fortune to perform a cure for Stossa the favorite wife of the king he was allowed to revisit his own country once more which he had been obliged to have the apparently unimportant affairs of which I have just read came near producing rather serious results. Stossa proposed to Darius to send persons with Democedes into Greece in order to make necessary examinations of the country for carrying on a war with them telling him that by engaging them in this war he would win for himself honors and show his people that their leader was a man of courage besides said Stossa \"I have heard great things in favor of the women of Lacedaimon, Argos, Athens and Corinth and should be glad to have some of them in my service. strikethrough: Did I call her a woman allow me to say demon as something else?

The Bablonians occupied four years in preparing for this war but Darius with the whole force of the Persian Empire succeeded in destroying the city which had been unclear in a terrible manner even though the Babylonians used every means to preserve it in their power adopting such outrageous resolutions as the following, that of destroying all such persons as were not servicable even their wives and children by strangulation. The bablonians strengthd so much their forces in this manner that they regarded them as impregnable and for a time they did seem to render the unclear efforts of the Persian fruitless but fortune favored them after the lapse of eighteen months. Zophyrus, a devoted friend of the kings feeling a strong desire that Darius should succeed in the enterprise in which he had been obliged to engage, caused his own ears and nose to be taken off and himself to be covered with many wounds then presented himself to the king stating his intention of going in this conclusion to the enemy and representing there that he had been thus injured by the king for daring to advise him to give up fighting against a people as well armed as they had had proof that the bablonians were. He went and as he anticipated was placed commander over many troops finally he was intrusted with guarding the gates of the city which he allowed Darius to enter without any resistance. As a reward,  Zophyrus was given the whole revenue of this great city but nothing could restore him to his former beauty nothing fully compensated him for his daring deed. Darius caused the walls of the city to be taken down and pardoned all the inhabitants save 3,000 of the principal actors in the revolt.

All historians however agree in representing them as extremely ignorant and savage, not avaricious and even destitute of a knowledge of the use of gold and silver but ever anxious for virtue. As was a Scythian king who taught his sons the following beautiful lesson. The king on his death bed called all of his sons to him and gave to each one after another a bunch of arrows desiring them to break them. \"Then he untyed the arrows and giving them one by one they were easily broken. Let this emblem said the father be a lesson to you teaching you the great advantage which results from unity & concord\". As the Scythians became intermingled with more learned and avaricious nations they seemed to lose their peculiar characteristics of innocence simplicity and frugality and were transformed into very different individuals. It was before this change that Darius warred with them. There seems to have been no real cause for this war but was engaged in on the part of Darius to gratify ambitious desires. He did not as his brothers advised him consider whether it was just and for the good of his subjects but hastily assembled a large army with which he thought to conquer them easily and marched forward but he soon wearied of the long marches which he was obliged to take through countries which the Scythians had rendered destitute of water by filling up the wells and springs which were not very abundant at any time. Darius desiring to put an end to the tiresome journeys through this land sent to the king of the Scythians to know why he did not give him battle or acknowledge him master by sending him water and earth. Indathyrsus answered \"If I fly before the prince of the Persians it is not because I fear thee, what I do now is no more than what I am used to doing in time of peace.

The Persians were after this glad to make a retreat they suffered much passing through the desolate country of the Scythians but finally arrived safely in their own country. The Scythians desiring revenge invaded some of the countries belonging to the Persians but nothing very serious was the result. Darius then formed the project of bringing India under his power in which he was successful. In the 28th year of his reign he warred with Greece. Among other cities with which he had engagements was Athens the native place of two very important of two very important characters Themistocles and Aristides the former was bold and enterprising though desirous of distinction he was much devoted to his friends exclaiming on one occasion when accused of partiality to them, \"God forbid that I should ever sit upon a tribunal where my friends should find no more favor than strangers.\" Cleon a celebrated Athenian renounced all his friends on his becoming administrator of affairs lest they should cause him to forget his duty.

He was a brave man and did much for his country's good but was not prompted as was Aristides for he appeared selfish at times. Such were the characters of those whom Darius had to contend with in Greece hence it is not strange that it was no easy matter to take possession of the country. The first city which he attacked was Marathon but was defeated by the Athenians though there were of them but a handful of men in comparison with the Persians. Miltiades was the able general on this occasion his army consisted of bold, intrepid men who loved liberty and dreaded slavery and tyranny more than death. Monuments were erected various parts of Greece to the memory of these men who had done so much for their country's welfare. Miltiades was not long treated kindly by the Athenians but was condemned to death being suspected of treachery. He was commuted afterwards and fined the sum of 50 talents not being able to pay was imprisoned which soon caused his death. There seemed to be much doubt of his guilt but the Athenians were desirous of disposing of him for fear his great fame and merit might enable him to gain such power over them as would cause them trouble forgetting his former services they punished him in this unjust manner.

Darius resolving to go to war was himself this time having had his army defeated at Marathon was obliged according to law to name his successor before his departure. Though Artabarganes was his elder son Xerxes became his successor for several reasons the principal of which was that he was eldest son of the king while his brother was only the eldest son of Darius. This matter was left to Darius' brother who decided in favor of Xerxes, with which decision all seemed satisfied. Darius never returned but was much lamented by his subjects though they were aware that he was not destitute of faults. He seemed to love justice and respect laws yet many times did his passions cause him to act contrary to justice and law, Xerxes who reigned 12 years spent the first four in preparing for the war against the Grecians whcih his father had begun. In consequence of his care and the extent of his kingdom he commanded the largest army of which record consisting of 5,283,220. These millions of people consumed 662,040 bushels of flour per day besides other provisions in proportion which Xerxes had conveyed to them by ships. We are told that the army was so large that in order to number it they were all required to stand successively within a wall which would hold a certain number. All the Athenians in banishment were called home among whom was Aristides. All were needed at this trying time. Leonidas, a Spartan was chosen commander of the Grecian army for the first battle. His army consisted of 11,200 men determined to die if not victorious.

Though Xerxes was apparently successful at the battle of Thermopylae yet Leonidas with the 300 Spartans who fell with him exhibited such daring and noble spirits that the Grecians were inspired with courage to fight on in defence of their country while intimidated the Persians destroying in them every hope of subverting Greece. The Athenians thought it advisable to desert Athens in order better to be able to defend other portions of their country. They had an engagement at Salamin in which place the Grecian fleets were all assembled under Themistocles who succeeded (with the aid of Aristides) in defeating the enemy and causing Xerxes to flee for safety to his own country.  Though Xerxes commanded so large an army and engaged in war so often that he was not a brave man but on the contrary was in constant fear for his own personal safety. Mardonius was left with 300,000 men to perform the work that more than 1,000,000 could not do. Mardonius tried to tempt the Athenians with beautiful presents but they informed him that nothing would tempt them to give up their liberty. Aristides gradually gained the favor of his people again and ever acted justly, he addressed one of the ambassadors of Mardonius thus \"Be assured that as long as that planet (pointing to the sun) shall continue its course the Athenians will be mortal enemies to the Persians and will not cease to take vengeance of them for ravaging their lands and burning their temples.\" The next battle was at Plutae in which they were again successful.

We see at every little distance boars and towns clinging very closely to the water, yes, for it is from this they gain their sustenance. Still more rivers join it till it has become so wide we can hardly see across it therefore we can pursue it but little farther. We shall soon get to the ocean; we are there and it is useless to try to proceed for the water sometimes runs in one direction and sometimes in another. Since we can go no further let us consider what is the use of all this. The stream has been of great use from the first for the larger and more powerful it became the greater good it accomplished. No charges were made or thank yous said for its water and yet everyone who desired could use as much as they wanted and for any use they wanted it, but I am sure they are welcome to it for there is plenty and to spare.

All the children seemed brighter and happier after sipping of the pure water and how thankful that old miller looked, if he did not say so his actions plainly told, for he knows it is the means by which he can procure food for his wife and darling children. The old washer woman is furnished with means by which to live; it contributed to the enjoyment of all who made use of it and the larger it grew the more useful it became. But it may now be asked how does Wisdom resemble it? we can neither take it up in a glass and drink it nor will it turn a mill, but yet there is another way. The mind the seat of Wisdom in infancy resembles the place from which the waters originated; it is at first limited in its power to do good only serving to render happy those who come directly under its influence.

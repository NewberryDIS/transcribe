May 4th\nMy Dear Lea\nYour letter in relation to your m.s.s work was not placed in my hands as soon as it ought to have been but I'm? hastening now to reply to it I hope I am not too late to give you the little advice I have to offer, to the disposal of your book, whatever it may be worth.\nIn the first place however let me express my sincere gratification that any hint of mine has induced you to take up your pen which I have no doubt has been exercised to some purpose? and now for the booksellers arrangement.  There are but two good ways of making this.  The one is by actual sale of the copyright.  The other the other by letting a publisher share the profits if he will take"},{"pageid":54809,"pagefilename":"31ae09fdcafd996cb575f2e6bb349175.jpg","transcription":"the risk - as for publishing the work on your own account do not think of it. Whatever may be its merit it will not pay expenses unless some leading bookseller has a pecuniary interest in its success.  My advice to you is this.  If a publisher will give you $600 or $1000 for the copyright sell it to him.  Small as the amount seems it is in fact very large for an authors first book.  The publisher who buys it will then exert himself to make the investment good.  Your work will be pushed everywhere and when it gains you reputation you can make your own terms for the next one you write.  I fear however that you will not get this amount however poor a reward it may seem for your labor If so I then advise you to make terms with a publisher for half the profits - he taking the risque of all expense retaining at the sametime the copy-right in yourself"},{"pageid":54810,"pagefilename":"e63db132f802575721b8d2efb45ab982.jpg","transcription":"These were the terms upon which my work was published and they would have proved profitable if I had not been guilty of a folly which you must avoid.  I was modest about success when my publisher asked how large an edition he should print and the consequence was that the edition was so small in comparison with the cost of the work that the expenses swalled up nearly all the profits.  By taking bold ground and insisting upon a large edition (2500-? 3000 copies) it makes it the booksellers interest to push the work into circulation as much as possible in order that he as well as you shall reap a harvest for his extra trouble & expense.  Carey & Lea or the Harpers are the two best publishers you can have .You ought to be one the spot however while your work is printing to correct the proof sheets yourself.  If you treat with the Harpers I shall be happy to introduce you to them & may be of some service to"},{"pageid":54811,"pagefilename":"b9c44cb249e577978750aa3bde277a92.jpg","transcription":"you in effecting an arrangement which I need hardly add will give unfeigned pleasure to \nYours Cordially\nChas.

Traditions of the Cherokee concerning what is considered as their early and orthodox religion. There appears to have been a belief, as far back as the history of this nation can be traced, that certain beings came down from on high, and formed the world, the moon and the stars. These beings were supposed to have always existed together and always to have been identified with each other; one in sentiment and action, and so remaining eternally. We call them Beings, because the Cherokee word designating them, implies, according to the peculiar genius of the original language, not only more than one, but more than two. One part of the nation only designate them in general terms: In another part, the aged employ three different words to express their name, which are at present obsolete, but which analogy, as well as their definition given by such natives as remember them, explain to mean, first: U, ha, lo, te, qa, i.e. Head of"},{"pageid":69819,"pagefilename":"cc665b469f23803731189bc025473c33.jpg","transcription":"of all Power, or, literally, Great beyond expression: second, A, ta, no, ti, i.e: United, ore, literally, The Place of Uniting; allusive to the spot where vows of perpetual friendship are made, as explained elsewhere in these pages, and which is called A, to, no, ti: and, third, Usgo, hu, la, signifying, as nearly as can be ascertained, the bowels, just below the breast; as supposed to be here employed synonimously with the same word in our own language, when applied to affection, or the mind.

Whomsoever they call dies and in whatever way they see fit. They are enthroned in purity, or, as the natives express it, on Three White Seats above. To them all prayers are to be addressed. They will judge, and reward or punish. They send messengers to this world upon human affairs.

In this form of celebrating the Green Corn Festival, or Festivals, we may perceive, that with it, appropriate observances, several of the ceremonies, of the Ah, tawh, hung, nah,- the Festival of Propitiation, or Cementation,- and those by no means accordant with the occasion, or occasions, of which it bore the name,- are intermingled. The prayer for cleansing from all the pollutions and impurities of the year preceding; and the various typical lustrations, so obviously connected with that prayer, are manifest interpolations; and the impressions that they were originally borrowed from the Ah, tawh, hung, nah, is strengthened by the afsection of those who describe the mode of celebration which is just given,- that the people considered themselves purer after this Festival than at any time during the year; a remark invariably accompanying the accounts given by their elders of the Ah, tawh, hung, nah,- the Propitiation or Cementation Festival only;- and surely inapplicable to any of the rest.- A further evidence in proof of this view of the matter, may be found in the fact that the observers of the mixed form now described, have no"},{"pageid":69949,"pagefilename":"637899e061ba127d0201dde7c397ab52.jpg","transcription":"no knowledge whatever of any special Feast of Propitiation, or Cementation. -- Hence it is clear that the ceremonies must have been confounded at a very remote date; and equally so, that ages must have since elapsed; -- the observance of the forms in question not being accompanied with the slightest idea of their import.\n\n    A more modern method of performing the New Green Corn Feast, by the different towns, preserves the original features more distinctly, and proceeds as follows:\n         The Ti, nu, li, no, he, ski,--the Seven Counsellors selected by the A, tsi,nu, sti, on his returning from the National Council, with his report, and the permission,as before described, immediately made the following preliminary arrangements:\n    They appointed the time, and by their messenger, notified the people of the town.

The priest then proceeded to offer the sacrifice. This was done as follows:\n    The priest had a structure, or a sacred room, into which no one might enter but himself and his right hand man. The right hand man having most carefully swept this sacred room, raised a smooth topped altar of fresh earth in its centre,around which he drew a circle including a sufficient space for the fire.

A form of them which is still recollected, is described as follows:\n      Families who could not attend either the national or Town Feasts, before tasting their green fruits, would send for a priest.

His account is as follows:\n                           This greatest of Cherokee festivals takes place annually, commencing after the corn has ripened, and continuing, at different places, throughout the main part of the autumnal months. Each point designated for holding it, is sought by an immense  multitude.\n                          There appears to be no standing rule in regard to the number of days to be devoted to the observance, throughout the nation, or at a single place. A green corn dance sometimes continues three days and at others from four to seven.

The chief of the town in which the Festival is held, generally leads the dance. He advances, singing, into the square level yard in front of the house, and, as an auxiliar to his voice, shakes a small gourd with gravel enclosed in it; the music of which resembles the rattles in the throat of the dying. Presently he is joined by a considerable number of men; -- (women do not participate in this dance); -- some with guns and pistols charged with powder and wadding; others, with clubs, poles and branches of trees. Heading the column, he proceeds several times around the yard; then commenced crossing it backwards and forwards, repeatedly, until he has, in this manner, traversed it from one end to the other. The dancers, now grown numerous, and unclear curving in single file, exhibit the serpentine appearance of a still worm, and as their movements are perfectly regular and simultaneous, not unfrequently impress the idea of a vast water snake curling about on the smooth surface of a river or lake. -- Meanwhile, an irregular firing of guns & pistols is kept up; and the noise is tapered off with hallowing and shouting. \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           This"},{"pageid":69954,"pagefilename":"8221c78cfc35b23bb59a723bd59ae198.jpg","transcription":"138\n\n    This dance continues the greater part of the day, with intervals for partaking of refreshments, consisting principally of bread made by enveloping dough of Indian corn and beans of the new crop, in long green blades of corn, and when thus arranged, boiling it.\n   The remainder of the day passes in exercises similar to the foregoing; & the night in performing the common dance.\n   Excessive drunkenness, and its consequences, generally prevailed; especially towards the close.

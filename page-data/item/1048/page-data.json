Traditions of the Cherokee concerning what is considered as their early and orthodox religion. There appears to have been a belief, as far back as the history of this nation can be traced, that certain beings came down from on high, and formed the world, the moon and the stars. These beings were supposed to have always existed together and always to have been identified with each other; one in sentiment and action, and so remaining eternally. We call them Beings, because the Cherokee word designating them, implies, according to the peculiar genius of the original language, not only more than one, but more than two. One part of the nation only designate them in general terms: In another part, the aged employ three different words to express their name, which are at present obsolete, but which analogy, as well as their definition given by such natives as remember them, explain to mean, first: U, ha, lo, te, qa, i.e. Head of"},{"pageid":69819,"pagefilename":"cc665b469f23803731189bc025473c33.jpg","transcription":"of all Power, or, literally, Great beyond expression: second, A, ta, no, ti, i.e: United, ore, literally, The Place of Uniting; allusive to the spot where vows of perpetual friendship are made, as explained elsewhere in these pages, and which is called A, to, no, ti: and, third, Usgo, hu, la, signifying, as nearly as can be ascertained, the bowels, just below the breast; as supposed to be here employed synonimously with the same word in our own language, when applied to affection, or the mind.

Whomsoever they call dies and in whatever way they see fit. They are enthroned in purity, or, as the natives express it, on Three White Seats above. To them all prayers are to be addressed. They will judge, and reward or punish. They send messengers to this world upon human affairs.

The \norder, dated 2nd Jan'y. was not published until the 6th and \nI got it on the 9th. By it I am surprised to find myself\nassigned to the 9th Cavalry.

After the first\norder filling the places of Cox and Graham I knew of no\nvacancy to be except Gray's, of that I spoke to the Adjt Gnl.\nand the only other regiments named, in case I could not go to\nthe Tenth were the First and Fifth, in both of which I have\nmany friends. You may judge therefore of my surprise\nat finding myself put in the Ninth especially when I see \nthat there was plenty of room in the Tenth, - more particularly\nas my old company was left open by Capt. Burke's transfer to\nthe supe's and I might just as well have been sent to that \nas Capt. Norvell, an infantry officer who goes there.\nI am assigned to \"M.\" Co. of the 9th.

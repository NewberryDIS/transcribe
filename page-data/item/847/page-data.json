April 30. 1845\nHonorable Sir, \nSuffer us, Sir, in behalf of a disfranchised and long afflicted people to prefer a few suggestions for your serious consideration in hope of a friendly and unequivocal response, at as early a period as may suit your convenience, and the extreme urgency of the case seems to demand.\nIt is not our resent design to detail the multiplied and aggravated wrongs that we have received in the midst of a nation that gave us birth. Some of us have long been loyal citizens of the state over which you have the honor to preside, while others claim citizenship in each of the states of this great confederacy. We say we are a disfranchised people. We are privately told by the highest authorities of this state, that it is neither prudent nor safe for us to vote at the polls; still we have continued to maintain our right to vote until the blood of our best men has been shed, both in Missouri, and the state of Illinois with impunity.\nYou are, doubtless, somewhat familiar with the history of our extermination from the state of Missouri, wherein scores of our bretheren were massacred, hundreds died through want and sickness, occasioned by their unparallelled sufferings; some millions of our property were confiscated or destroyed; and some fifteen thousand souls fled for their lives to the then hospitable and peaceful shores of Illinois; and that the state of Illinois granted to us a liberal charter, for the term of perpetual succession, under whose provisions private rights have become invested and the largest city in the state has grown up, numbering about 20,000 inhabitants.\nBut, Sir, the startling attitude recently assumed by the state of Illinois, forbids us to think that her designs are any less vindictive than those of Missouri, she has already used the military of the state, with the executive at their head, to coerce and surrender up our best men to unparallelled murder, and that too, under the most sacred pledges of protection and safety, as a salvo for such unearthly perfidy and guilt, she told us, through her highest Executive officer, that the laws should be magnified, and the murderers brought to justice; — ; but the blood of her innocent victims had not been wholly wiped from the floor of the awful arena, where the citizens of a sovreign state pounced upon two defenceless servants of God, our Prophet and Patriarch, before the senate of that state rescued one of the indicted actors in that mournful tragedy from the sherriff of Hancock? county, and gave him an honorable seat in her Hall of Legislation, and all others, who were indicted by the Grand Jury of Hancock county, for the murder of Generals Joseph and Hyrum Smith are suffered to roam at large, watching for further prey.\nTo crown the climax of those bloody deeds, the state has repealed all those chartered rights, by which we might have defended ourselves, lawfully, against aggressors, If we defend"},{"pageid":54813,"pagefilename":"81c8cdccb6e4de8b9802f948bfacf1fe.jpg","transcription":"ourselves hereafter against violence, whether it comes under the shadow of law, or other wise, (for we have reason to expect it both ways,) we shall then be charged with treason, and suffer the penalty—and if we continue passive and nonresistant, we must certainly expect to perish, for our enemies have sworn it. \nAnd here, Sir, permit us to state, that Gen. Joseph Smith, during his short life, was arraigned at the bar of his country about fifty times, charged with criminal offences, but was acquitted every time by his country, his enemies or rather his religious opponents almost invariably being his judges. And we further testify, that as a peope, we are law abiding, peaceable and without crime, and we challenge the world to prove the contrary; and while other cities in Illinois, less than ours, have had special courts instituted to try their criminals, we have been stript of every source of arraigning marauders and murderers, who are prowling around to destroy us, except the common magistracy.\nWith these facts before you, Sir, will you write to us without delay, as a father and friend, and advise us what to do? We are, many of us, citizens of your state, and all members of the same great confederacy. Our fathers, nay, some of us, have fought and bled for our country, and we love her constitution dearly. \nIn the name of Israel's God, and by virtue of multipled ties of country and kindred, we ask your friendly interposition in our favor,—Will it be too much for us to ask you to convene a special session of your state Legislature, and furnish us an asylum, where we can enjoy our rights of conscience and religion unmolested?\nOr, will you, in a special message to that body, when convened, recommend a remonstrance against such unhallowed acts of oppression and expatriation as this people have continued to receive from the states of Missouri and Illinois?\nOr, will you favor us by your personal influence, and by your official rank?\nOr, will you express your views concerning what is called the \"Great Western Measure,\" of colonising the Latter Day Saints in Oregon, the Northwestern Territory, or some location remote from the states, where the hand of oppression shall not crush every noble principle, and extinguish every patriotic feeling?\nAnd now, Hon. Sir, having reached out our imploring hands to you with deep solemnity, we would importune with you as a father, a patriot and statesman; by the constitution of American liberty; by the blood of our fathers who have fought for the independence of this republic, by the blood of the martyrs which has been shed in our midst; by the wailings of the widows and orphans; by our murdered fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, wives and children; by the dread of immediate destruction from secret combinations now forming for our overthrow; and by every endearing tie that binds men to men, and"},{"pageid":54814,"pagefilename":"2bc0595f31bcac5dd267d6fd971fb0d5.jpg","transcription":"renders life bearable, and that too, for aught we know, for the last time, that you will lend your aid to quell the violence of mobocracy, and exert your influence to establish us, as a people, in our civil and religious rights, where we now are, or in some part of the United States, or at some place remote therefrom, where we may colonise in peace and safety, as soon as circumstances will permit. \nWe sincerely hope that your future prompt measures towards us will be dictated by the best feelings that dwell in the bosom of humanity, and the blessings of a grateful people, and of many, ready to perish shall come upon you.\nWe are, Sir, with great respect,\nYour Most obedt.

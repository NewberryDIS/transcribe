Gist's age was about 60. His manners were never forward and are now become somewhat reserved. It can be seen that his mind is always busy within him and, especially when smoking, he seems absorbed in thought. He is thin and above middle height. In dress he adheres to the old costume of the nation, but without ornament; wears the tunic and robe, leggings sometimes of buckskin, sometimes of blue cloth, moccasins instead of shoes, and a turban.The family of Gist, on the Indian side, (the mother's,) was of high in the nation. The famous John Watts was ? of them. Two of his uncles were men of great distinction; one of the two was named Tahlonteeskee, (the overthrower,); and the other  Kahn-yah-tah-hee, (The first to kill.) Kahn'yah'tah'hee' was the first principal Chief of Old Cchota? Cayoka?, the ancient town of refuge. He was called the Beloved Chief of all the People. It was his exclusive duty and delight to be a peace preserver.

Both Chiefs were murdered brutally on the spot. Some days subsequently, the invaders having withdrawn, the people returned. Carrion birds had devoured the body of the one chief; but that of the other, Kahn'yah'tah'hee, the Beloved of all, was untouched, and unchanged even in death. His hand still grasped the violated Flag of Peace, and upon his dead lips lingered a benignant smile. Mike Waters, the brother in law of Gist, told me he was the first person upon whom Gist tried his Alphabet. He then taught a son of Waters. His first combinations were for such exclamations or descriptions of sound as might most strike attention; for example, he began with Yoh-hoo-hah- to represent the grunting of a hog. In the outset of his labours, he first attempted to make a sign which should represent a whole sentence. Afterwards, he tried only whole words. Then he broke a word and tried the parts in different forms; and thence fell into the framing of syllables."},{"pageid":70120,"pagefilename":"dfc3da88fb888fd01ce49f4621c7f5ba.jpg","transcription":"The first composition he put together was in the subject of the boundary line between his own country and Georgia and Tennessee. After that, he had a suit in the Indian Court held at Chatouga. He wrote down a statement of his case. When got there, he read his statement, instead of speaking; and all the people were amazed. This was about a year after the invention was compleated. A son of the great John Watts, (brother of the Watts who was at the Council Ground,) and who was called the Big Rattling Gourd, was one of the listeners. At daybreak next morning he went to the house where Gist stopped. He knocked? and when he sat down, he told Gist he had not slept all night for thinking of the wonder. It surpassed any thing he could have conceived it probible for the power of man to accomplish. Gist replied that he had done it that he might do good to himself and family, though while he was doing it all his relatives? thought he was inspiring? both his family and himself.

Gist said he could; but then he had not time. If, however, Big Rattling Gourd would come over to his house, he could do it for him there. It was agreed that they should meet for the purpose in two weeks. Big Rattling Gourd was to have dictated certain speeches of Occonostota and the Sittle?Stalking? Turkey which were often alluded to in the Councils, although very imperfectly quoted. Big Rattling Gourd thought it important that they should be faithfully repeated to the Head Men of the Nation and to all the people. It was therefore understood that Gist, when he had noted them down, should attend the next Council and there read them; but unluckily Big Rattling Gourd was taken sick, and could not keep the arrangement; and soon after Gist went to Arkansas, on a list and Big Rattling Gourd died.

The first characters which he invented resembled german text. Few or none of these were retained. At the house of Mike Waters, he was struck with the \"Bible Book\" as Waters called it, of Sally Waters, his wife. He was then studying for characters to make use of in print. He copied out some of the letters and said those would do for print of the old ones for writing.

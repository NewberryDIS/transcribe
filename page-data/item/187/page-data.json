Permit me just briefly to review a few of the points you referred? to in your letter. I perfectly agree with you in believing that Christ is the Son of God. Still that does not prevent his being equal to God. Nay unclear fact that he is the Son would go to show that he was equal. As Christ himself says that men may honor the Son even as they honor the Father.

So to unclear reference for Christ's followers being one, he prays that they may be united in that intimate bond of fellowship. One in feeling. In perfect equality as himself and his father are one. In reference to the trinity I will say but little. I consider in one of the most glorious truths in the whole Bible I do not see how many pages in the Bible can be explained without it.

The same day we called on Mr. Brown the Taverner, I saw him at Mr. Andrews shop when Brown said Doct. Taylor sends patients to me for spirituous liquor, L. told him not to mind Doct. T. for he liked Brandy himself and it was reported that he sometimes had to take a nap before administering medicine, a few such like things he spoke as report. Brown spoke of it to Wetherell who set the Doct. all on fire, he has raved and tore been to Fitchburg twice to see lawyer Wood, what it will all amount to time alone will develop. Brown was excited because he could not sell rum Wetherell no less so and has been urging Taylor on. There are various reports of damages the higher $10,000 the lower $1,000.

I wrote to Dr. Regimir when I was on my way past that I was almost entirely discouraged and asked for for directions from the directors, but received none, and on my arrival home found none but I had received a promise from Mr. Waggoner of Tiffin, Seneca Co. that if I would make a visit the he would use his influence in raising funds for the school, and with high anticipations I started a journey of 150 miles expressly to see what I could do. But you can imagine my disappointment when I arrived and found him all carried away with \"Spiritual Manifestations\" and so completely soured with Gurley and others who had written against it, was he, that I could not get a dollar from him nor anyone else in all that region. He is immensely rich and so are others whom he mentioned, but they all turned immortal Rappers and the sprits have told them, as they allege, that they must keep all their funds to build a Spiritual Temple, and brother Geo.

If the Advocates of my faith are not well educated, and in every way well calculated, to defend its principles must necessarily suffer. The Universalists more especially have need of education in order that they may wholly eradicate every vestige of the traditionary teachings of Partialism, and inculcate into them the glorious truths of the Bible.

I waited some time, hoping I could get a favorable answer in reference to the boarding of my daughter when you Boarded, but receiving no intelligence I wrote to Mrs. Mixer to See if She would take her. (I had heard that Mrs. Boothe was full of Boarders) and felt verry sorry that She could not accommodate us.  I thought if any body was Entitled to any favor of that kind We certainly were.  It is not my nature to complain, but really it cast a more dense Cloud over my Spirits that had already Seemed low down, because of misfortune through which I had passed and hundreds of disappts.  I had met with while trying to keep up the Institute and promoted its best interests. But let that pass.\nIn answer to your inquiry about the propriety of Being Ordained before you receive letters of fellowship. I consider it would be perfectly proper to do so if there is nothing Expressly to prohibit it in the constitution of the Washington Association. And I do not know as there is. Or if you wished to go out under Unitarian colors it might be proper even if there was a prohibition in that Association. (I suppose that is the Job!!) I do not know certainly as I will be there, because if you are ordained and Mr. W. from Wheeling can be present - there will be Enough to form a Quorum and transact the duties of the occasion. And if you are ordained (if you are careful to get your License)  you can do the interesting Job. Mr. Weaver Engaged me to perform last (Dec.) month, not knowing then that you purposed to be ordained.\nAnd Especially as I had promised to be in Madison the next Sunday following unless I recall the appt.

My first select school, was the pleasantest school I have ever taught. Perhaps one great reason for this was, that I found myself much relieved by a division of labor. After the close of my winter school, I found myself more inclined than ever, to make teaching a profession; and, in order to fit myself, the more ably to perform the duties of this office, I decided to pursue my studies during the summer at the N.E. Normal Institute. This school is one which was established last spring, in the beautiful town of Lancaster, under the direction of Professor Mr. Russell, and the patronage of the town. Differing from other normal schools of the commonwealth, it has no assistance from the state. It has for its chief object the fitting of teachers for High and Grammar schools, although none are restricted to a particular course of study. It is arranged as a school of departments each under the care of a separate principal instructor and assistants Proff. Russell, Principal of the Rhetorical and Elocutionary departments, Dana P.

In fact this is a subject about which I have had much serious thought of late, but still am at a loss how to decided it.\n\nMany times have I felt a great desire to consult my old teacher who is now so far away, upon the matter Will he not now give me a little advice?

It is very fortunate for S. that it is so as she has not strength to take care of a troublesome child. They were both quite comfortable. While we were there Susan with a little aid from Mary did her work; her help not having arrived according to contract. They have since moved into a new house with more room and better out door accommodations. The cottage which they have occupied was built for them & under Mr. Wales' direction. It was very convenient and nice within but had no outdoor conveniences, Except a yard of 10 feet & was surrounded by houses so that all her movements were visible--this was an objective but still they would have continued had the proprietor not died Embarrassed.

And yet when we think of it, it is easier when they appear not to suffer. Abby had suffered a great deal, but during the time I was with her she lay so quiet as an infant. Her last struggle was hard to witness, but her face after her spirit had departed wore a calm & beautiful expression. I feel very much for her little children. She was a very indulgent mother & very much attached to her children. She used to often say to me, when speaking of dying \"If I could only take a child on each arm, I would be perfectly willing to go.\" Her children are not left destitute, but with enough to raise & educate them & many kind friends.\n\n                             Alice has been quite unwell since I wrote you last.

Williamson, twice while I was in the city. I liked his sermon very much. I have read some of his writings but never heard him before. He is a pastor of the First Society now. They have a splendid church, but it appears to me there is a sort of an aristocratic air around one when they seat themselves in the congregation. Perhaps it is because I am a \"country girl\". But I do not feel so much at home as I do at the Second Church.\n\n       You spoke of learning a Swedenborgian  minister preach. Did you ever hear Mr. Giles of ? I have heard him spoken of very often there. He preached a funeral sermon in our village, not long since & I wished very much to go, but Aunt was going, so I remained at home with the children. She was very much pleased with some parts of his discourse, but like many others whom I have heard speak of them, thought there were a good many absurdities.

But I wish to hear Mr. Livingston, who I heard you speak of & I do not know whether I can go both places.\n Our Sabbath School has closed for the Winter, the weather being bad & so many of the scholars living at a distance. They have taken pieces for another exhibition, which we expect to have between Christmas & New Year. Can't you come & spend the holidays with us and attend it? We should like to have you come very much.  Uncle Henry has just returned from a visit-Cart? and is very well. The person of our name on the Arctic was no relative. Wasn'nt  - that  shocking?

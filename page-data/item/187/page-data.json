Permit me just briefly to review a few of the points you referred? to in your letter. I perfectly agree with you in believing that Christ is the Son of God.

So to unclear reference for Christ's followers being one, he prays that they may be united in that intimate bond of fellowship. One in feeling. In perfect equality as himself and his father are one.

My health has been better than I could have expected considering what I have gone thro. I am not, neither have I been, encumbered with a superfluity of flesh.

I have learned by experience that there are limits which cannot be surpassed without positive injury. It is after having been deprived of health we are enabled the more correctly to prize it. Then there are benefits to be derived from sickness or from pain in conferring this power of appreciation. Afflictions are designed to open our eyes to our duty.

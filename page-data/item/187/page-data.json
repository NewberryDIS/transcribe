Im [all] with my promise I sit down this afternoon to write a letter. Letters from absent friends and acquaintances are always very acceptable to me here at College. I often wish I had more of them.  it affords me such comfort and satisfaction to read them and often to re-read them. I hope therefore that among your many correspondent you will\nnot fail to afford me as lengthy ? a reply as your time & convenience will permit. \nI had unclear previously to this to take this opportunity to offer unclear\nsome the reasons for a few of the opinions which I hold respecting some particular\nscriptures doctrines.

I am willing to admit that I regard most of the\ncreed unclear called unclear as true.  I am aware? too that this\nis a good deal of prejudicial.

Kendall, A severe snow-storm prevents my going to church today, so I will be for once, before-hand of my usually prompt husband, and for a novelty, commence a letter to you first. I am in haste to offer you my congratulations on an event which I trust will be fraught with much happiness to yourself, and also to her on whom your affections are placed. Pray that happiness be unclear and unending. I could not but rejoice at unclear intelligence, because I think you are one who will know how to appreciate the love of a devoted wife, and are so well fitted to receive and confer enjoyment in domestic life. May the blessing of Him from whom cometh all our good gifts, attend you in your new relations, and may life henceforth be gilded with a brightness hitherto unknown. I feel that you will not have extra vagant?, ill-founded notions to be painfully corrected by experience, but that your anticipations, having been reasonable, will be realized. Life is not all sunshine, and it is vain to expect that a universal law will be set aside in our case, but if its \"rough ascent, its flowery slope\" will both lead us to the \"green fields and still water\" of the [[head??]-only world, the glorious prospect may well reconcile us to any difficulties or trials, with which infinite wisdom sees fit that we should contend. Life, to me, means a different aspect from what it did when I last saw you. Written a few days after Mr. H. wrote you, I was attached with a bilious fever (brought on, he thinks, by mismanagement and a suspension of cold water treatmenet) and, for a time I felt, that in all probability, death was close at hand.

Is it not a cheering, delightful hope? Your questions relative to those who have no chance to know the right, are full of interest, and it is a subject on which I have often thought. I cannot for a moment believe that such will be consigned to endless woe. Among the countless worlds, with which the universe is filled, it seems not improbable to me, that there may be mansions for those unfortunate ones, not filled for heavenly bliss, because they were placed in circumstances which precluded the possibility of their becoming good, where they will have other and better opportunities for spiritual development. But one thing is certain \"the Judge of all the earth will do right.\" To whom little is given, of them but little will be required. I need not tell you that we watch the development of our baby boy's faculties with great interest. We already see that there will be much for us. Instead of inheriting his father's calmness, he is impetuous and impatient, with a ready smile the instant he finds he has survived his trials and an eye that promises energy and intelligence.

mine"},{"pageid":42978,"pagefilename":"22ee949238e2e981c74a7f062a3e7f8c.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42979,"pagefilename":"7acc66c96abc2400400afe08e3242ec3.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42980,"pagefilename":"69e4f6877a1c29f1328be45a25261aed.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42981,"pagefilename":"8ba87c65d1bacf3d8d8f55d178c27b8c.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42982,"pagefilename":"fd41436640fc0383863a4df12e705dcf.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42983,"pagefilename":"7dbdaa1f9a34eb720416f30cde274718.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42984,"pagefilename":"142e553c1322e3ba704dfb7c5c78f55f.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42985,"pagefilename":"8f905df8253ce18158afbbd93e9270c3.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42986,"pagefilename":"07cb93946515ae726a4fd08b108190af.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42987,"pagefilename":"a2e08cacd45027a0c365659791a03374.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42988,"pagefilename":"372347bb26a4b60ce7dcdbb1b71e077e.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42989,"pagefilename":"5f29d377f50d26bb8b1b80392f7c2691.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42990,"pagefilename":"11b74fb07549ee88a926148cfd2a2302.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42991,"pagefilename":"bb9206eba808d35cbed59a60ab82390f.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42992,"pagefilename":"8620add54c646066205a3e54c10d8bb8.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42993,"pagefilename":"a21eb8bd810592724a4c60dd42b38078.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42994,"pagefilename":"190d222734e232a7d613977b029f8eb9.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42995,"pagefilename":"432e887dab4dce8876468dea37e8acc2.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42996,"pagefilename":"9d8de9c3fed31346de8b703da67ccfeb.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42997,"pagefilename":"60e69333bacb2e1c5da6471a3da192bf.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42998,"pagefilename":"706242a364225645be2035aa2a01a5c3.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":42999,"pagefilename":"834e1ac023644d417ff5cac029bf9892.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43000,"pagefilename":"f755f82dc66736df9215620e32f27828.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43001,"pagefilename":"70f9ec10698a69f79c7294849bae0f37.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43002,"pagefilename":"64f854682dca0b00def28b906f76c10e.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43003,"pagefilename":"ae3b6cfe2ed8dd7af0de0db01186dd47.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43004,"pagefilename":"61376f4677ece9bb255dbf1b7384d68c.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43006,"pagefilename":"d01bbc38965be9d3f9662b9945f93cf6.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43007,"pagefilename":"b4dc29bca0483c71c7341be3d9df832d.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43008,"pagefilename":"d4cff9e6b496c4b8ae3d7e43efbee298.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43009,"pagefilename":"61a2308732fc5af89db348fc4233be8c.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43010,"pagefilename":"9359edc0e5fd79f6606ac4e49f21effa.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43011,"pagefilename":"d66a7cc2d045665670b994d7ef630b9c.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43012,"pagefilename":"fe45a02e2d15cefb6bea535d98b0491a.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43013,"pagefilename":"e35c38ffda1907915f17783ef7f327c4.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43014,"pagefilename":"9e3231bd95538308db21338975d61d1d.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43015,"pagefilename":"8bb1d2525849ffaa689c63629e000246.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43016,"pagefilename":"b66f6ddb198f1e1e83ad1dd1e4facf5f.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43017,"pagefilename":"dd66d0b23e37e32b61c46748ff44292d.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43018,"pagefilename":"e636106cbb3ce0d059dfcb7b65071d3d.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43019,"pagefilename":"cd22a0948e57ea4f758ce77e8184e68f.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43020,"pagefilename":"4ee2a66e37e2cfed5fe0a405853980cb.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43021,"pagefilename":"23d2d4f94f9a070ee38ecdb996c0ee50.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43022,"pagefilename":"898ee1afda79cadfc7cf190276a2fcb4.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43023,"pagefilename":"297a760a7ba85d99a2d9da1b261d8ee9.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43024,"pagefilename":"5096680edde9b869c820808634159439.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43025,"pagefilename":"c5e81929f48a2e5b3a05a4f8322c4d97.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43026,"pagefilename":"7b20837cb08c99077baf129bec250520.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43027,"pagefilename":"2482ff4bd1e683738b92198c394f4b56.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43028,"pagefilename":"0f0ec8fd947139979bca7bc5daf18b51.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43029,"pagefilename":"34c792d2722c59c49683129cf351cf05.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43030,"pagefilename":"2515b2a5eae8e929e33426dc27c5a359.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43031,"pagefilename":"6f4ff98f3ae82a29c36f143055c439c0.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43032,"pagefilename":"4774d3f647f32377530490166841e037.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43033,"pagefilename":"e13ff8592abdf532a5543ec1c3cc0c2c.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":43034,"pagefilename":"7c1ddde7119

Pa. June 6, 1853\nMr. Kendall, Dear Sir,\nI wrote you some time since relative to a box of books and Anatomical Plates that had been sent to me at Marietta. I also spoke of a letter that had been sent meat the same place, care of Crawford & Co. (I think that is the name) Booksellers.

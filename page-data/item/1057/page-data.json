In the first place I am inclined to believe that the that the tax required to be paid, the length of time that one should be compelled to take on permit for, & the condition of giving bond & security, would all go to operate with the felling of some of our people, so as to employ whitemen without permits, and hazard the risk of being returned to count & fined according to law. - You will see that their late resolution imposes no penalty for hiring without permit, & you will further see that the law imposing a penalty for such offence leaves not, then obvious, that a great many of our citizens would live without permits, & rather pay the Ten Dollars than to be forced in the sum prescribed in this resolution? In the second place, I am of opinion that the expense of removing the white people who may be introduced into this nation under permits should not altogether fall upon the nation or the sheriff; but the employer, or the obstinate white man should pay the necessary expence of removal. I consider this subject one of great importance, and that it is highly necessary we should guard against being overburdened with temporary citizens of this character. And at the same time, we should not suffer the improvement of the mechanical art, to languish through a contracted policy of legislation.

The fact is, we do not believe that there is money enough in the nation, to pay the money due to the Bank; consequently the property of the debtors of securities will have to be sacrificed, and the nation probably will lose a great part of the loaned money.

Upon their arrival at Washington City & after the usual salutation of taking the Secretary of War & the President by the hand, was over, a communication was immediately addressed, thro’ the War Department, for the consideration of the President, touching the various & multifarious claims & grievances of the Nation, growing out of the oppressive acts of the State of Georgia & the bad conduct of her citizens.  After remaining in a state of suspence for a long time, a note was received from the Secretary of War, informing our delegation that no reply would be given by the President to their communication, as the nation had already been fully informed on the various subjects. This policy on the part of the President, to evade a direct reply, is no less astonishing than unjust, because the communication embraced several subjects of new occurrences,which had never been laid before the government.  The Delegation, under these circumstances, were then induced to draw up & lay before the Congress a Memorial, praying that measures may be taken for relief of our sufferings,- but, owing to the multiplicity of businesses before Congress and the shortness of its session, our friends did not succeed in bringing our affairs to a final issue, - Yet it is gratifying to say that numerous memorials from the most respectable citizens of the United States, praying Congress"},{"pageid":71200,"pagefilename":"97bb1202d3c6eb661cc883f204ac4876.jpg","transcription":"Congress to interpose for our protection were presented, and that the friends of the Indian cause both in Congress & out of it, appear to be increasing. - It will be remembered that in the course of the last Winter I served a notice upon the Governer & Attorney General of the State of Georgia, that a motion unclear be made by the Cherokee Nation thro’ their Counsil before the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of injunction to restrain that State from the enforcement of her laws within our territorial limits.- The motion was accordingly made and the arguments heard, and upon the simple question whether the Indian Tribes within the limits of the United States are to be viewed as a foreign State in the sense of the constitution, or not, - and a majority of the judges entertaining an opinion in the negative, the injunction has been denied. - Not - withstanding, the Court has admitted the Cherokees to be “a managing its own affairs and governing itself; - and that the acts of the United States Government plainly recognize the Cherokee Nation as a State & the courts are bound by those acts.” - Thus it will be perceived that the denial of the injunction has no bearing whatever upon the true merits of our cause, but owing to the limited powers of the Supreme Court; insofar as the opinion has been expressed in regards to the rights recognised & secured to the Cherokee Nation by the acts of the General Government, they are maintained by the Court & will be sustained whenever a case between proper parties may be brought before it.

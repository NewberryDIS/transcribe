In the first place I am inclined to believe that the that the tax required to be paid, the length of time that one should be compelled to take on permit for, & the condition of giving bond & security, would all go to operate with the felling of some of our people, so as to employ whitemen without permits, and hazard the risk of being returned to count & fined according to law. - You will see that their late resolution imposes no penalty for hiring without permit, & you will further see that the law imposing a penalty for such offence leaves not, then obvious, that a great many of our citizens would live without permits, & rather pay the Ten Dollars than to be forced in the sum prescribed in this resolution? In the second place, I am of opinion that the expense of removing the white people who may be introduced into this nation under permits should not altogether fall upon the nation or the sheriff; but the employer, or the obstinate white man should pay the necessary expence of removal. I consider this subject one of great importance, and that it is highly necessary we should guard against being overburdened with temporary citizens of this character. And at the same time, we should not suffer the improvement of the mechanical art, to languish through a contracted policy of legislation.

Upon their arrival at Washington City & after the usual salutation of taking the Secretary of War & the President by the hand, was over, a communication was immediately addressed, thro’ the War Department, for the consideration of the President, touching the various & multifarious claims & grievances of the Nation, growing out of the oppressive acts of the State of Georgia & the bad conduct of her citizens.

This policy on the part of the President, to evade a direct reply, is no less astonishing than unjust, because the communication embraced several subjects of new occurrences,which had never been laid before the government.  The Delegation, under these circumstances, were then induced to draw up & lay before the Congress a Memorial, praying that measures may be taken for relief of our sufferings,- but, owing to the multiplicity of businesses before Congress and the shortness of its session, our friends did not succeed in bringing our affairs to a final issue, - Yet it is gratifying to say that numerous memorials from the most respectable citizens of the United States, praying Congress"},{"pageid":71200,"pagefilename":"97bb1202d3c6eb661cc883f204ac4876.jpg","transcription":"Congress to interpose for our protection were presented, and that the friends of the Indian cause both in Congress & out of it, appear to be increasing. - It will be remembered that in the course of the last Winter I served a notice upon the Governer & Attorney General of the State of Georgia, that a motion unclear be made by the Cherokee Nation thro’ their Counsil before the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of injunction to restrain that State from the enforcement of her laws within our territorial limits.- The motion was accordingly made and the arguments heard, and upon the simple question whether the Indian Tribes within the limits of the United States are to be viewed as a foreign State in the sense of the constitution, or not, - and a majority of the judges entertaining an opinion in the negative, the injunction has been denied. - Not - withstanding, the Court has admitted the Cherokees to be “a managing its own affairs and governing itself; - and that the acts of the United States Government plainly recognize the Cherokee Nation as a State & the courts are bound by those acts.” - Thus it will be perceived that the denial of the injunction has no bearing whatever upon the true merits of our cause, but owing to the limited powers of the Supreme Court; insofar as the opinion has been expressed in regards to the rights recognised & secured to the Cherokee Nation by the acts of the General Government, they are maintained by the Court & will be sustained whenever a case between proper parties may be brought before it.

The sentiments of the people having been so fully & decisively expressed on this subject heretofore, and it being impossible to attend the agents' call in person, they held meetings in their respective neighborhoods and appointed Committees from among themselves, to attend on behalf of the nation; - they also gave written orders on the agent in favor? of the National Treasury.

Consequently you will, As an act of justice to yourselves, as well as towards your country, take such suitable steps as you may deem prudent and proper, to counteract the foul aspersion cast upon your fellow citizens by those men; and to guard these citizens against the intriguing artifices of those who may be disposed to co-operate with them upon their return home, in forwarding the policy of the President for our national ruin. The Supreme Court in the case of Worcester &? Butler vs. the State of Georgia has determined the question of our national rights as fully as can be. The decision is final & cannot be revoked: but the course ? of legal proceedings is necessarily attended with tardiness, consequently should the authorities of Georgia, refuse, as they have done, to release immediately those much injured imprisoned gentlemen, and continue still to arrest & oppress our citizens, we should not be discouraged; - because the President, out of his disappointments, may still pursue a political course? towards us, under the hope that by withholding from us the protection of the government, a Treaty may yet be effected previous to the time when it shall become his imperious duty to act for the enforcement of this decision of the Supreme Court. The conflict is now between the United States & Georgia. The final issue ere long will be seen. Should Georgia prevail, the Union of the States is dissolved: but should the United States regard the constitutional liberties guaranteed to their citizens, Georgia must submit to see the Cherokees triumph over their oppressions under her usurped authority, therefore, let the people endure patiently to await the final result. We have gained a great point and they should be watchful over the conduct of such disappointed traitors as may be found amongst them.

Perhaps you have heard that there is an emigration open here. I have been Government has not paid the late emigrants yet, and there seems no likelihood of their ever getting pay for the valuations. We have spent what little we did fetch & now we are suffering at this time & this, with the loss of our friend, is distressing; and if government keeps payment back much longer, we shall have no use for it, for the people generally are dying up very fast. When we come into this world we fetch nothing with us, & it is certain we take nothing away.\nThis is the situation for us emigrants.

We were all in great haste to see the agent, so as to get our rations; for, although we had the choice of getting money or rations, we were, from necessity, compelled to take corn & cattle; - and that, not as we pleased.- Most of the cattle that the emigrants got, were as wild and as unruly as the buffaloes in the western prairies from us. \nAnd as to the money arising from our improvements, it was only paid to us a few days since.

Again - the intercourse of the United States laws prohibit Cherokees from disposing of spiritouous liquors in any way whatever in the nation.\nAnd as to having protection from the United States, four Cherokees have been killed by white people on the frontiers; and not one white man has been killed as yet.\nAnd as to fulfilling the Treaty stipulations with the Cherokees in the West, I see in the treaty of 1828, that the United States is to pay to the Cherokees in the West $2,000 annually for ten years to support the schools in the nation. I saw a school at Dr M. Power's, to be supported by the money above mentioned. The school has been in operation three of four years. Not one dollar is paid as yet.

But on a full consideration of the whole subject & a review of all that has taken place, it appears clear that any arrangement short of a general removal of your people, would neither relieve the difficulties of the present, nor prevent those of the future. The considerations connected with this matter and the views of the Executive, have so often been stated to you, that it would be a work of supererogation again to discuss the matter. You are in the midst of a white community. The great body of your people are qualified, neither by education, habit, nor by their pursuits, to live in such a state of society. That this remark is not applicable to all, is most freely admitted. But that it is so to much the largest portion of the Cherokees, is firmly believed. What then would you gain by a permanent establishment in your present situation? Want & misery would press upon your people; Depredations would ensue: which would terminate in collisions, and too often in bloodshed. The laws of the state where you might reside, would immediately interpose with all those consequences which are known to you.

With the consent & co-operation of the well informed & influential among the tribes yet remaining within the civilized border of the United States, there is little room to doubt, but that the ultimate issue will be happy for the Indians & consoling to all who take an interest in their present deplorable condition. But, if men of this character, among the Indians, discourage all efforts to give effect to the enterprize, and thwart the views of the Government, lamentable as the issue may be, it will be beyond the reach of the Executive. The tribes must rapidly decline and ultimately perish.\nBut, independently of any other considerations, the proposition you make, with respect to the permanent retention of a part of the State of Georgia, is inadmissible, because it would prevent the settlement of the very question which has been pending so many years, & which has occasioned such anxiety to the Government. Nothing short of an entire removal from that State would terminate this difficulty. And the President does not feel himself authorized to agree to any arrangement which would not finally settle the troubles that have occured.\nWith respect to your remarks concerning the letters addressed to this Department and the President, I will state here what I observed to you personally - that those letters contained nothing more than the views which you had so often submitted, and which had been as often fully considered and answered.

Agent; and myself, from which you will discover that the Cherokee people have been compelled to hold an election in the vicinity of Ridge's, in the charter limits of Georgia & distant not short of ninety miles from the Cherokee agency, on the 20th inst. for the purpose of determining in what mode the annuity should be disposed of.-  The sense of the Cherokees on this question having more than once been expressed in favor of paying it over into the hands of John Martin Esq, the National Treasurer, it seemed there was no good reason left, why the agent should have persevered, by insisting on the election taking place at a time and place designated by himself, without consulting the feelings & convenience of the Cherokee people, who alone could be rightfully interested in the subject.-  I happened to be at my Brother, Lewis Ross', house when Mr Schermerhorn arrived at the agency; and, upon his request, I had an interview with him. He expressed a desire to have an opportunity of seeing the most influential & leading men of the nation, that he might converse with them. I stated to him that in case Major Currey could be prevailed upon to change the place he had designated for the election, so as to hold it either at Red Clay or at the Agency, that I would endeavor to gratify his wishes, by inviting them to attend; but, as you will perceive from the documents submitted, this reasonable request was not complied with; and it then became my duty to request the general attendance of the people at the place designated by Major Currey, inasmuch as the Department of War having given instructions that the money should be paid over agreably to the votes of the majority of the persons attending.- Of the votes given in, there were 2225 for paying if"},{"pageid":71313,"pagefilename":"9920490becd74a7cd4175ca2687f3148.jpg","transcription":"257\nit over into the National Treasury and 114 against it.- Instead of closing the election on the day fixed upon, it was protracted by the introduction of speeches on the past of Mess Schermerhorm & Currey & the two Ridges. In consequence of this, together with the rains which fell, and the exhaustion of the provisions with which each individual had supplied himself (except one day's ration in meat furnished by Mr Schermerhorn) the people experienced great privation & fatigue.\nAmong so large a concourse of people assembled under such circumstances, there have been, as might reasonably have been expected, some unavoidable accidents which, in a greater or less degree, affected their health. The Speaker of the General Council, Going Snake, very narrowly escaped destruction at the encampment of the first night after the close of the election, by a shod horse treading on his head;  but he is now much better, and it is confidently believed that he will soon recover. Owing to these various causes, you will readily see the impossibility of complying with the suggestion of Mr Schermerhorn, to pay you a visit, at the agency on the 29th inst. Did circumstances permit, I should take pleasure in going up to see you.\nI am, Sir, \nVery respectfully\nYr obt. hble: servt:\nJno Ross  P Chief of unclear\nCherokee Nation."}],"title":"John Howard Payne letters on Cherokee history, early to mid-19th century"}}}

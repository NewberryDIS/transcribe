Archabald was not fifteen years old, small of his age, looked like a pretty little dark-eyed girl.  He was so young and small that he had to enlist as a drummer.  But he refused to drum and demanded his rifle, proving himself to be an excellent marksman, he had his way.  These boys served their full time all were wounded but all got safely home at least.  They lived near Lake Minnetonka and I had some acquaintance with them before the war. Truer steel was never yet put into men.\n3. Standish - Decker - recruits who enlisted at the same time I did.  Standish was a good boy twenty years old son of a Methodist Preacher - his family of the Old Massachusetts stock.  He himself was born in Massachusetts. When the war broke out he was a student air(?) Hamline University. So also were Phillip Hamlin and Charles Berdan students and sons of Methodist preachers. Hamlin was killed at Gettysburg. So far as I know Berdan is living yet. He was twice wounded. There were, perhaps, a dozen more students of the university - among the Seargent Wright with whom I came most in contact and most admired. I think it can safely be said that all these students gave a good account of themselves.\n4. \"Jarve\" Jarvis Chaffee a young man who in 1859 had his right arm and scalp torn off in my fathers threshing machine. It was several years before the sore scalp healed.  Meanwhile it would inflame whenever he tried to study.  We kept him in our home the greater part of the time for two years.  I became much attached to him and from letters I wrote him I have been able to supplement much of what would have been lost with my Diary which I lost July 30, 1862 at the Battle of White Oak swamps.\n5. \"Melissa,\" Melissa Bond a cousin of mine who had lived several years in our family.

And likening that here to real truth with regard to its extreme cruelty known, much would be done at least to soften its horrors if not to eradicate it from the worlds history. And knowing that the truth will never be known unless those who have witnessed its heart-skinning scenes record the same.  I have written this journal with a view to telling some truths that will not be recorded in its histories.  Yet many of these truths are so black, so very infamous, that I have been compelled from very shame to forego giving them a place in this record.  I had planned to write them separately, that such as desire it, might know them; but time and other important designs may deter me from my design.\nI have had many other motives for writing this work. I believe that the world would be improved were every man to leave a written record of his experience and the difficulties encountered in this world.\nBesides, having been an infidel, and having by the grace of God been led to see the utter folly, to say no worse, of infidelity, the years in which this change was wrought(?), however, disagreeable they may be in other respects, have in this connection reminiscenses which I trust will always be sacred to my heart. And I have felt it to be my duty to record it.  The reader will observe that I have kept my journal according to the feelings at the several periods of which I am speaking.

On that day the President of the United States (Abraham Lincoln) first issued a call for 75000 men to suppress insurrection.  I had at that time made preparations to travel through Ill. But on the 11th I met my old friend J.M. Mulhollin with a copy of the late proclamation.  And also a paper enlisting men for the service.  I at once resolved to enlist as it was but for three months.  I was accordingly at a war meeting at Minneapolis on the 20th and that day news first came to us of the attack on the Massachusetts boys in Baltimore.\nOn the 22d our company was full; elected officers, and was accepted by the Governor.  After a visit home we went to drilling on the 24th, the citizens boarding us at the Cataract, and Nicolet. We remained in Minneapolis until the 29th when we marched to Ft. Snelling where we here mustered into the U.S. service.  I must confess that I was exceedingly verdant to say the least, besides being very slow to learn the drill.  But all this did not in my mind justify all the abuse which I imagined I was receiving from one John Hollett (Hoblett?).  After bearing with him nearly two weeks I finally had to go so far as to threaten fight before I could persuade him to desist.  He, however, saw the error of his way, asked pardon, and ever afterwards treated me like a gentleman.  Our company officers were Capt. Putnam, 1st Lieut. Wood, Second Lieutenant D.C. Smith.  We had an orderly Sergt. by the name of Hammon who seemed to control the appointment of all the rest of the non commissioned officers, and the first thing required in order to attain office was Ignorance, second Impudence, and last but not least, the aspirant must be what Yankees would call a \"Smart boy\" i.e. a perfect fool."},{"pageid":87605,"pagefilename":"eaed2a92787321f9d91ea7e23c616f10.jpg","transcription":"I did not remain long in the service.  This is owing to the fact that there was an order issued for us all to be mustered into the service for three years or during the war, or be discharged, so on the 20th of May I was discharged not at that time being ready to go for so long a period.\nOne of my reasons for not entering the service was because I feared being sent to duty on the frontier instead of going south against the Rebels.\nBut it so happened that the Regiment was ordered south, participated in the Battle of Bull Run in which they suffered considerable loss.  A call was issued for men to recruit the regt.  I at once decided that it was best for me to go.  On the 22d of August 1861 I repaired to Ft. Snelling and was duly mustered into the service.  Soon after entering I made the acquaintance of an Odd genius by the name of Hiram Wentworth, commonly called Long haired Wentworth. I also made the acquaintance of one M.G. Standish and likewise A.L.M. Decker. I quote from my Diary beginning Sept. 2d 1861\nMonday.  I left Mr. E.G. Browns. Jarve walked with me a short distance. We finally parted, it may be for ever. Tis a great consolation to have a friend like him at such a time as this. I arrived at the Fort about two oclock P.M. There has no one enlisted for the 1st Regt. since I left the fort last Friday. There is a report now current here that we are not to be sent to the regt. until 150 men have enlisted.  That being the number required to full up the Regt.

I am sitting by the Minnesota river just at the edge of the water. The Sun in his golden splendor has just risen.

We had a religious discussion to day with our drill Sergeant who it seems is afflicted with the halucination that there is a God. *  While we were resting he said something about God when Wentworth the long haired added: \"That is, if there is any God.\"  The Sergeant seemed amazed and in true Christian spirit exclaimed \"you brute.\"  A discussion followed in which the Sergt. was worsted.  When the confab ended out Christian friend had become quite too humble to call an Infidel a brute simply because he did not agree with him.  Lizzie Hurvey and W.F. Atkinson visited the fort today. I attended the Lyceum(?) which the boys of 2d Regiment have established. Their business matters wee carried on rather clumsily when compared with Highland Park.\nThursday Sept. 5th\nOur drill master and most of the man have been gone away to day. Consequently we had no drill. We are now sixteen in number.  I have had an opportunity to read some to day. I was reading in a book of visionary Imagination entitled A Panorama of Time by David A. Moor. It belongs to a young man by the name of Standish who thinks it is a great work. But I withhold my oppinion until I have finished reading it. I visited what I shall term the Elysian. \n\n I was a rank Atheist in those days, though not so much so now. In short I believe I am the farthest thing from it in the world.\nMARGINALIA: Christians often by using such expressions as \"you fool, you brute\" to infidels show them lack of the first principles of Christianity and give their enemies a very powerful weapon to use against them."},{"pageid":87607,"pagefilename":"0ec07f3f10ea01fa46e7f2104a61f7ae.jpg","transcription":"\"Elysian Fields.\" * Reader should you ever be a Ft.

Be sure not fail to pass down them far enough to emerge on to the open land between the second bank and the river.  This Spot should be seen in Spring, summer, or Autumn, for it must be but a dreary place in winter.\nFriday Sept. 6th\nI continued reading \"The Panorama of Time\" I also studied Latin a little. We had no drill this forenoon. But we drilled well this afternoon.  My thoughts continue to bend on the kind friends I have left. But I will say that never in my life did I see so many civil and intelligent young men in one crown as the recruits of the 1st Regt.  To be among a set of men, ten or fifteen in number, away from female society, who employ their leisure time in reading and pleasant conversation, instead of Blackguarding and carousing is indeed surprising to human nature.\nSaturday Sept. 7th Morning.\nI feel Sad and Meloncholy. My mind is somewhat distracted owing in part to an unpleasant dream which I had last night. I finished reading the Panorama of Time this morn I think it has probably done me some good. It has some sense and more religion. I practices shooting with a revolver a while. Then strolled up the river and have there laid down in Solitude and written the above. But it is nearly noon and I must return to the fort.  Evening. I received a letter from Brother Benj, one from Mother, and one from Jarve.

And although it was raining I took my usual walk. I went to the grave yard. Not the one near the Fort but the one on the hill south of the road leading to Minneapolis, about a mile distant from the Fort.

I then ascended a tree to see if I could see any rebels on the other side of the river, not knowing that it would have been no new sight to any one acquainted with picket duty. That night when it came my turn to stand picket, I held my gun cased and cocked and was attentive to every noise no matter how insignificant.

But when I came to try it I found that my stomach was not so delicate as to grumble at the best and most wholesome food I had ever found. No bread could compare with hard bread, plenty of pork and beans, dried apples, coffee, sugar, tea, molasses, vinegar, salt, dessicated potatoes, fresh beef, hominy, mixed vegetables.  What was the use to complain at these camp rations?  True it might be harder on a campaign. I stated these views to some of the soldiers, older in the service by three months than myself.  They immediately rallied on their military experience and on Bull Run, telling me if I had been there, it would do for me to talk.  If there is any position on earth that is disagreeable it is to be a recruit.  All the older ones, be they ever so green themselves, and the greener the surer it is to be so.  Will assume to know more than you, even about things which you have had as good an opportunity to observe as they have.

I immediately made for a place where the canal crosses a creek just at this archway my retreat came near being cutoff by a man, a dog, and an old woman. I had to drop my prize lest I should be reported to head quarters and orders were strict in those days.  Some of the boys got hold of my failure and enlarged on it and finally had quite a rig on me for a few weeks, but some of the worst ones getting caught fairly stealing molasses, thier batteries were fairly silenced, and when they named goose, all I had to do was mention molasses.\nOn the 20th of Oct. a little after noon the Long roll was sounded and we were soon under arms and marched down to Edwards Ferry.  A few shell were thrown across the river and Co. E of our Regt. crossed in a flat boat to the other side of the river. After remaining a short time they came back and we returned to camp.  (About 2 miles distant).  We had orders to be ready to mark by daylight the next morning. and accordingly we left camp at an early hour on the morning of the 21st and were soon at the river. after some delay we began crossing over to Virginia, scarcely two companies had crossed when word came that Col. Baker's column which was crossing at Balls Bluff five miles up the river were within one mile of Leesburg and we were therefore hurried forward as fast as the crossing in two little flat boats and a skiff could be affected. We had not got more than two Regt. across when we heard the Battle open at Balls Bluff.  We could distinctly see the shells bursting, but no orders came for us to move. We might easily have attacked the enemy in the flank, but for some gross mismanagement.

When they were right at the edge of the woods the enemy opened on them very suddenly from only a few paces distant.  There being an entire line of battle of rebels in the woods the company retreated as fast as possible.  Then a company of sharp shooters opened on the enemy they having pursued Co. I out on to the open ground.  Besides this a section of Pickets Battery opened on them and they were quickly repulsed.  One of Co. I was wounded and brought to the rear another was shot and left.  The more than brutal traitors bayonetted the wounded man.*  Gen'l Sander was also wounded in the leg from which he partially recovered, but died in February following.  It is believed the wound hastened his death.  After dark our Company was ordered on picket.  We approached near the woods whence Co. I had been driven, and it was so dark one could scarcely see a man three paces in the open ground. Judge them how it must be in a dense woods.  There an officer rode up and asked for twelve volunteers to skirmish the woods.  Without waiting for volunteers, our Capt. ordered the 1st Platoon forward.  I being in that plattoon we entered the woods keeping our groups of fours together we passed through the woods the enemy having abandoned the place.  We formed connections with 6 Companies of the 16th Ind. which had been cut off from the army for several hours and it was a wonder that the enemy did not attack and capture the whole of them.  In the morning we went to a house a little way off where we found a rebel soldier mortally wounded. He was a boy not more than 16 years of age, remarkably handsome, no doubt will long be mourned by his people.  He died the next evening.

During this four days campaign the lumbermen of our Regt were employed to the number of 300 in managing the boats winning from Genl Banks the high compliment. \"They are the Salvation of the Corp.\"  After this there were no more opporations worthy of note during the Autumn and winter of '61. The time was spent in drilling and building winter Quarters.  In those days I was very full of the potential idea of reforming the world, hence I suppose it was that I so much admired Shelley's poetry, for poetry is certainly is: / too much so for truth.)  I find on reading the letters that I wrote at that time I had some very wild fancies which have melted away before the stern light of experience.  During the winter I went so far as to prophesy the fall of the republic. Then again in the spring a little success made me prophesy the end of the war within a year.  But in this I was far more temperate than most of my acquaintences, for many of them were going home to celebrate the 4th of July.  How wild we were. One great cause why I dispaired of the country was because I had formed an idea from reading Plutarch that a true soldier embodied all that is manly; that he totally dispised luxury and show and that he never complained at the hardest fare, whereas I saw in our army a pettish disposition, complaining and whining like little girls for mere triffles.  I saw that show parade and what we call style was what most of the officers and men esteemed as the most necessary requisites to good soldiers.

But I believe I also made friends of another class by the same meanes. My disposition is not half way conservatism. and I have no desire that it should be so.

I carry my dislikes in a similar manner entirely too far.  But it is time to return to my narrative.\nNov. 26th\nAbout this time, I received notice of my brother Benjamins death. I was in rather poor health my self at the time and the sad news went very hard with me.\nI had in those days a very poetical idea of drill and discipline. I supposed it was absolutely necessary to understand the bayonet exercise to perfection. But in reality this branch military instruction is merely ornamental since the bayonet is never used in action.  The time was passed during the winter in drilling, and in doing guard and picket duty. Finally on the 25th of February we broke up camp and marched.  The roads were very bad.  We marched that day about 13 miles and encamped near Sugar Loaf mountain.  The next day we marched to Adams Town where we took cars to Harpers Ferry. On the way we passed Point of Rocks where there was a rebel battery that might have shelled our train very easily, and in fact a few nights afterwards did open on a train as it was passing.  We went over into Harpers Ferry village and quartered for the night in one of the old government buildings.  The next morn The town was thoroughly ransacked even the halls of secret societies were broken open and their records scattered.  I visited the engine room where John Brown was captured it still bore the marks of the contest.  I also went to what is stiled Jeffersons Rock.

Our company acting as provost guard we then marched to Bolivar(?) Heights where about 2 miles distant where we remained for several days. Then we marched to Charleston where after a short stay we moved on to Berryville we drove the rebels before us out of the village. Some of the printers of our regt. took possession of the Office of the Berryville Conservator and published two numbers of a paper to Suit their own politics.  We marched on the 12th of march to Winchester and back to Berryville the same day. This was the first day Col. Sully commanded the regt. the boys were well pleased with the prospect. We eventually returned to Harpers Ferry where we took the cars on the 22d of March to Washington. We remained in Washington several days. Our dress parades in the Capitol Grounds were very successful. We were finally to be received by the President, but Old Gorman got mad and showed his narrow mindedness by breaking it up.  We soon went across the Potomac to Alexandria where on the 29th of March we embarked for Hampton Roads.  We steamed down the river a few miles that night and anchored.  Just at daylight we got under way and passed Mount Vernon and Ft. Washington. It was so fogy that I could not get a good view of Mount Vernon but I have since had several opportunities to obtain as good a view of it as the thick foliage would permit. We anchored that night in the mouth of the Potomac. The next night we anchored at Fortress Monroe. On the 1st of April we landed at Hampton. This village has been burned to ashes by order of the traitor Magruder.  While we were camped near this place we had an opportunity to read the inscription on several of the old grave stones. Some of them bore the date 1657. We left here on the 4th and moved on to Big Bethel where our forces were defeated last year now was this surprising considering the position and the pains that had been taken to fortify it.

The ground here is so low and flat that the water will not run off and as it rained almost incessantly during the 5 days we remained here our situation can better be imagined than described.  No effort on our part could render us comfortable as we had no means at that time of raising our tents and beds from the ground.  I doubt not we might have been more comfortable than we were had we been more experienced.  But as it was we were wretched enough.  On the 10th we moved up close to the enemy's works formed our lines and opened the siege.  Here our duty was heavy enough; on picket every other day and on detail nearly all the rest of the time.  We built hundreds of miles of corduroy roads build forts then up work. It rained daily and disease was already thinning our ranks.  On the morning of the 4th of May.

And so little did our boys care for such things that they passed them by with only a few contemptuous remark about the men who were green enough to bring the weapons so utterly impotent to war.  Thus we see that the rebels had learned one of the many lessons which this war has taught them.  We likewise found several letters of defiance addressed to the D___d yankees.  The traitor Gen. Magruder had placed torpedoes in the works whereby several of our men lost their lives. On the morning of the 5th our advance came up with the rebels at Williamsburg and a battle ensued in which the rebels held their own until they were ready to retreat.  We embarked on transports May 6th and on the 7th arrived and landed at West Point. Here we found Franklin's Division hotly engaged with the enemy.  We landed and moved up to the support of some of our artilery.  The enemy ran out a battery and opened on our shipping in York River. The gunboats replied sending their heavy metal with such effect that the rebel battery was soon silenced.  About the same time our infantry succeeded in repulsing the rebel attach and so ended the Battle of West Point.  A few days after this our Regt. was on picket on the ground whence our gunboat had driven the enemy's battery on the 7th.  I had now an opportunity to observe the power of heavy artilery.  The shells had made holes in the ground each deep enough to bury a horse.  One had passed under the ___ a pine tree about eight inches in diameter, exploded, lifted the tree straight up, and set it down about 10 feet from where it originally stood.

I visited the old family burying ground, copied some of their inscriptions but I am sorry to say I have lost them therefore cannot give them here.\nOn the 16th of May I had my first taste of the extreme hardships of a soldier's life.  After standing guard the previous night in soaking rain we were compeled to act as rear guard during the day. the army moved only about 12 miles; but the rain continued during the entire day.  The mud was very deep.  In places however we found bottom at a depth of not more than four inches; this was a great misfortune, for said bottom was about as hard and smooth as ice.  Of course we would slip and fall in the super striation(?) of mud.

However this day we passed through New Kent C. H. which in truth is nothing but a Court House and jail. and miserable things they both are.  Nevertheless there is one object of interest even in this insignificant county seat. I allude to an oat tree.  I have seen several larger oaks. What then is interesting about this oak tree?  Nothing but the unparalleled spread of its branches.  We all agreed that it could not be less than 100 feet from the extremities of one limb to the extremities of its opposite neighbor.  Its top seemed nearly round resembling an umbrella. Its leaves and branches were very thick forming a delightful shade in which our entire Regt. 800 rested while they talked of its grandeur.  I said we camped in a wheatfield. Here it was that the boys of our regt. first begun that trade which afterwards was brought to great perfection, viz. making pipes of laurel root.  Upon this amusement of the soldiers I got up (if I may be allowed the expression) the following sentiment.  \"The pipe of peace, is carved by the sons of Liberty, from the root of the tree of victory.\"  Here also I heard a prophecy that our army would enter Richmond before the 1st of June. I demurred but my battery was quickly silenced by the steady fire of the readers of the N.Y. Herald though I must say it was not a votary of the Herald that first made the statement.  And here let me say that had the Herald said less about what Gen. McClellan would accomplish in a few days, it might have been better for that officer. But that contemptable sheet took our General and his army, marched over the entire Confederacy, and finally, threw them against the invaders of Mexico, dethroned Napoleon and shook the center of all European monarchies, in the remarkably short space of one month.

The rising sun gave us warning of an excessively hot day with which prospect we were by no means delighted.  This day, while it was yet morning and every thing was pleasant we passed the church where twas said Our Great Washington acknowledged Hymens(?) right to rule supreme over the lives of men.  As we approached the ancient structure from the east the road on either side for near eighty rods is lined with a double row of beautiful cedars. While to the south west extends a great forest of oak.  It seemed that this forest was full of little birds \"And they sound joyous each and all\" as their euphoreous notes well attested. The church itself was in a remarkably good state of preservation.  It was a brick building with a brick spire of no great pretensions. The building was small, but neatly and tastefully constructed.  If my memory serves I would say that it was of Gothic style.  But there was but very little architectural display in its construction.  It was not long after we had passed the church before the rays of the sun began to tell on our frames in a most pitiless manner.

Rations were drawn from the commissary for every man in the company.  Some did not drink the consequence is easily foreseen, either the rest would get more than a ration or there would be some left.

As I shall have occassion to ventilate this subject at large in several instance I will leave it for the present.  From this camp we moved to a place called Tyler's Farm about 10 miles from Richmond.  We remained here several days.  Here as a result of the whiskey ration our Orderly Sergt was reduced to the ranks.  While we were at this camp we were detailed to build a bridge across the Chicahominy.  We worked in mud and water very frequently waist deep. The last evening of our labor we were cheered by the sound of Battle at Hanover Court House.  And before day we were on the move to support Gen. Porter's column which had been engaged, but there was no more fighting and so we returned to our old camp May 30th.  About noon on the 31st, we heared heavy firing on the other side of the Chicahominy.  We soon received orders to be ready to march with only one days rations and our rubber blankets. In a short time we were on the move and were soon at the bridge which our regt. had thrown across the stream and which was two miles from our camp.  Here Gen. Sumner received orders to march for the first time.  He had acted thus far on his own responsibility and it was well he did so. Had he acted otherwise the two Corp which were already across the stream must have been annihilated. Our regt. was in advance of the Corp and as soon as we were fairly across the stream Gen. Sumner rode up to Col. Sully\n\nThis of course was the nonsensical notion of a greenhorn."},{"pageid":87632,"pagefilename":"c6e2132225e57d4910a2c28b1ba68bcd.jpg","transcription":"33\nand ordered him to move forward with all possible haste.  The order was obeyed we pressed onward part of the time at double quick pace. We soon began to meet stragglers each of which was invariably the only or about the only man of his regt. which was left.  We moved on a little farther and began to meet wounded men they usually spoke moderately that the Battle was going rather against us and we were needed badly on the field. Col Sully soon halted to load. After we were loaded he gave us this march instruction. \"Men I want you to fire low.\"  His voice was not raised seemingly above his common talk. Yet from that day until the end of the war I believe I never fired my gut without thinking of his words.  We again resumed a rapid pace and soon arrived at the scene of action. We had now got the start of our brigade some distance.  We were met by Gen. Abercrombie and ordered to the right. We now moved altogether on the double quick.  We soon arrived at our propser station it was in a wheat field. The enemy were already emerging from the woods on the opposite side. The Col. ordered us forward as if he would attack them. There was a gap at that time of not less than eighty rods between our left and the extreme right of the rest of the army. When they saw us they fell back into the woods and our Col. ordered us to lay down; this order we were very willing to obey for two reasons.  Safety, and rest.  We could now see the enemy moving to the left.  But before they could complete their arrangements for cutting us off from the rest of the army our brigade had arrived.  And two regts of Abercrombies brigade were ordered to move to the right and form connections with our right.  This maneuver was nearly accomplished when the rebels appeared at the edge of the woods and poured a voley upon them. They immediately fronted and returned the fire.  I noticed"},{"pageid":87633,"pagefilename":"b6ec9366d8061b128d02125a6ad731d6.jpg","transcription":"34\nthat their first volley mainly went towards the tops of the woods.  But after that they stood and fought for nearly two hours without seeming to stir out of their tracks.  This was the longest stand still and fight that I ever saw; and what was more strange although they were in open ground, their loss was very small. Soon after the rebels began their attach to the left of our Regt became engaged. They captured a Colonel and Adjutant and about half dozen other prisoners. One man, in our company (which was on the right) was struck by a stray ball; it entered his forehead and passed entirely through his head. He died next morning. His name was Nicholas Hammer a Dane.  He had served six years in Europe, and had participated in a number of battles.  Another man was wounded which was the entire loss of our Regt.  It was nearly dark when the enemy was repulsed. We lay on our arms in line of battle during the night. But there was little demonstration made by the enemy until about 9 A.M. when they made a furious assault on our Centre but were met, repulsed, and pursued for some distance.  So ended the Battle of Fair Oaks.  One good joke connected with this battle was that some of the chivalry having rode out in their carriages with their ladies to see the vandal Yankees driven into the Chikahominy lost their fine vehicles, horses and all 'a prey' (?) to the ruthless invaders and now citizens, take warning and keep at a respectful distance from battle fields, unless you go to be useful in some way or other; for, if you go to see the elephant tent to one bet you will get a better view than you desire. no possible good can arrise from your idle curiosity which really is an insult to the men who are doing the bloody work. and you will receive little sympathy from them in any misfortune which may befall you when you are so much out of your place.

We now began to construct breastworks, and were soon well-fortified.  On the 3d of June, I went back to the old camp, found that our bridge had floated away, and I was compelled to wade through mud and water for nearly half mile, this put me to reflecting on what might have been the result had the enemy attacked 24 hours later.  Most likely they would have ruined our army. And now for the first time I began to reason on the thousand instances in life where we see everything depending on very slight circumstances.  I did not then call it Providence.  But fate.  And I would often quote, \"There is a tide, in the affairs of men, Which taken at its flood; leads on to fortune\"\nBut I never quoted another which I now deem more appropriate and therefore use it. \"There is a Providence which shapes our ends; rough hew them as we will.\"\nI shall have plenty of opportunities to shew where my life or the lives of some of my comrades have been spared in a manner which would seem almost miraculous. And as it is with individuals, so is it with nations.  The result of a battle, nay, often of a war, may hang on the slightest circumstance.  \nWe continued to fortify our position; building strong breast works and cutting down the timber in front; until no enemy however strong, could have broken our lines by a direct assault. But when the enemy had reinforced sufficiently, of course nothing was to hinder them from flanking us, and this the[y] effectually accomplished a few weeks later.  The enemy soon contracted the disagreeable habit of shelling us two or three times a day, moreover, they would attach our pickets at night so that we were by no means certain of a good nights repose.

We were in a very unhealthy location this was in part owing to the late battle and in part to the low swampy nature of the ground. Many were sick and I confess I was not very well able to labor cutting timber. But, I was green enough to think it was a military necessity and was very well contented so long as I could see any use in all this cutting and digging. But, after I saw our fortifications were so strong, that no number of enemies could possibly carry them; I acknowledge I grew a little impatient, however I said nothing to my comrades, nor did I write any complaints home. Toil by day, and little rest by night, in an unhealthy country; can it be a wonder than many sickened and died while the remained grew thin and emaciated? After a few hard days work, (perhaps in the rain) we have laid down at night for much needed repose. but Hark! a gun another, another, in quick succession and with constantly increasing rapidity the reports of deadly weapons call every man to arms. Just as we are fairly in the ranks the cannon open their brazen throats. The firing ceases instantly. One would think that these great monsters rule the lesser imps with imperial sway, that they have commanded silence and no one dares disobey. They speak a few times more as if scolding their underlings for their disorderly conduct and all is still. We retire again but to go through the same routine.

Certain it is that he made an advance and approached neared the reb capital than any other commander reached on that campaign.  On the afternoon of the 26th the great battle opened on our right consisting of Porter's and Franklin's Corps, which were on the opposite side of the Chicahominy, and were advance up the stream a few miles farther than we were.  The firing of the Artilery was heavy and rapid lasting until after dark.  Then came a report of victory.  We had hitherto been under orders to keep strict silence so that there had not been a musical instrument heard during the month. But now the bands struck up the patriotic airs, and loud and long Hurrahs made the forests ring.  The rebel bands also opened, and their soldiers screamed and yelled after the manner for which they are noted.  There is this difference between the noise made by the two parties.  The cheer of a northern soldier is a course heavy Hurrah! while that of a southers is a fine scream more like the voice of a woman. And when they charge they make a similar noise.  There is nothing more provoking than this to an enemy. Especially when they have the best of the bargain and are screaming in pursuit.\nEarly on the morning of the 27th the battle was renewed and we discovered to our surprise and sorrow that our forces had retreated near four miles during the night and were now just opposite us.

We could see the filing of the artilery and the bursting of the shell.  This was a day of awful suspense.  And a deep gloom fell like a pall over the countenances of the soldiers.  In short, it was well known that we were being worsted(?).  About noon reinforcements moved from our flank to support the right. Night came about. The soldiers were required to lay on their arms at the breastworks. On the morning of the 28th, I was detailed to help draw rations.  The brigade commissary was a short distance in the direction of the bridge across the Chicahominy, which had been reconstructed, what was my surprise! to find Porters and Franklin's corps drawn up in line battle on our side of the stream and at a direct right angle with our lines.  Batteries unlimbered(?), and looking directly toward the old bridge which had been destroyed behind our retreating column.  There was no room to doubt that the enemy had broken our right flank; driven them across the stream; and were now between us and our base of opperations.  But a happy thought struck me, our army is now massed on one side of the Chicahominy; It is on the same side that Richmond is; our General will now order a charge on the rebel works, we will carry them; enter the rebel capital; and cut Lee's army off from all supports and supplies; we will then attack him and compel his surrender.  This was very nice to talk about and think about but would probably have met opposition in its execution.

A case shot exploded just in the right position to drop its leaden contents on every side of us. My comrade, who was with me, was just missed by more than half dozzen balls, and they fell around me in like manner.  And here are a few strange circumstances connected with this same solder, whose name was Marion Abbott, and myself.  Every battle which we entered my file leaders were either killed or wounded until he would stand for my file leader.  And the first time he went into battle as my file leader he was wounded.  This was at Gettysburg on the 2d of July and he was the only man in our company which was wounded on that day.  After we arrived in camp we lay down behind the breastworks. I noticed that my feet were more exposed than they would be if they were drawn up closer to the works. I therefore drew them up just in time to save one of them from a piece of shell about an inch square which struck just where it had laid a minute before.  The rebels moved out and attacked Smiths Division which joined ours on the right its own right laying on the Chicahominy.  They were repulsed with severe loss and afterward seemed inclined to be quiet until we should be ready to leave our works of our own accord.  We got very little sleep that night.

I cannot tell exactly what divisions engaged the enemy but Kearnes was one.  The enemy were repulsed.  We retreated to Savage Station. The weather was so very warm that many of the soldiers fainted from the intensity of the heat.  At Savage Station there was immense stores of ammunition, rations, and hospital supplies.  These were set on fire.  It seemed to take the enemy some time to resoslve to attack us here.  The field in which our division was massed was near three fourths of a mile square. At length the rebels run out a battery and opened on us.  This battery was stationed on the north western corner of the field and were in the southeastern corner a battery of 10 powder rifled guns replied with such spirit that the rebel battery was silenced in less than five minutes. The infantry on both sides now advanced and met in the woods just at the western end of the field and a short but bloody battle ensued our Company lost 13(?) men killed and wounded the enemy were repulsed losing one General (Griffin I think) at the first onset the 106 Pennsylvania which was just on the right of our regt broke and fled in the wildest confusion leaving our flank exposed but we did not yield an inch of ground, and other reliable troops soon came to our assistance.  The brush was so thick in the woods that I did not see a single enemy during the battle, but when it had terminated we found rebels within 40 feet of our lines.  After dark we withdrew from Savage Station and marched nearly all the remainder of the night.  After crossing the White Oak swamp we took about 2 hours rest.

We had not more than arrived on the ground and passed our battle line when we were ordered to double quick back to where we first started making four miles at double quick time. Many fainted so that when we arrived on the ground we would not have numbered more than 200 men.  We formed a line and marched forward. This was at a place known as Charles City Cross Roads. While we were forming Gen. Sumner rode up to the regt. and addressed us as follows:  If I send this regt. into those woods I don't expect to see it come out.\"  We were greatly puzzled to know what the general meant by this remark. But most of supposed he meant that we would be annihilated.  But he realy meant that though several different regiments had went into the woods, they had all been driven out again and he expected that we would remain and check the enemy. There was a regt. just then going into the woods ahead of us and we advanced across the field to its support but just as we had arrived at the edge of the woods that regt came back in the wildest disorder.  I should here remark that although bullets were flying like birds in the air we had not yet had a man wounded in our Regt. We halted in the edge of of the woods and lay down.

I had no appetite for anything else and yet I stood all the hardships though sick and worn to skin and bone.  Our Corps was stationed on the left and was not more than just in position before a rebel battery opened on us they did not hurt any of our regt though several were wounded in the brigade.  We were then removed into a woods still further to the left where we remained in peace and quiet during the entire day.  I saw Gen. McClellan on the field early in the morning riding along the lines and superintending the movements of the troops.

Now there is but two ways about this matter either Wilkinson knew better and repeated what he knew to be a lie or He knew nothing about it and yet told it for a truth.

The Battle continued until late in the night the enemy suffered a terrible repulse.

We had very little rest for the remainder of that day, the rebels keeping up a continued shelling.  About 9 P.M. we were relived from picket and posted in a house where we slept very well, on good beds.  Early next morning 13th the fight began in earnest our company was ordered on picket to the right of the town where we remained during the battle exposed to a heavy fire of artilery but out of musket range.  Lieut Ball took post in a house where he could observe the movements of the enemy.

Ball and Berdan went up into the upper story of the house to keep watch while I remained below to give notice if any messenger should come to the picket line. I was standing inside of the building looking out at a window, when the Lieutenant ordered me to take a post just outside, that I might see more readily if any one should some.  I had scarcely taken the new position assigned me, and was leaning against the wall of the house not more than four feet from where I was before when a shell passed right exactly where I had left, covering me with brick dust and stunning me so much that, although another shell passed nearly in the same place directly afterwards, I knew nothing of it.

I shall perhaps ere I close my book narrate many other such instances, therefore shall not say much on the subject, but only suggest to the reader that it would be worth his while to notice these repeated instance of what I believe to be nothing less than divine interposition.  If it had been but one instance I might have passed if off as the mere work of chance but when repeated more than a score of times it certainly cannot be thus lightly avoided. Hundreds of pieces of artilery played during the day. One of the most annoying features of the thing was that our batteries had been supplied with defective shell so that they fell among out own men. Charge after charge was made by our men on those heights.  \"But vain was their color, and their courage vain.\"  They were repulsed and slaughtered like sheep. Night comes on and the firing dies away, all the artilery is now hushed save one enormous gun on Mayers Heights, which from time to time like an angry serpent darts forth its tongue of fire, and the course of its furious missile is marked by a streak of fire from its burning fuse down it descends into the city and a heavy report tells that the fire has reached its explosive contents.

Yet for some reason unknown to me they did not see  fit to open on us but would only occasionally send us a shell to let us know we were not forgotten. But  after dark we were again ordered on picket.

But scarcely had I done so when the rebels fired on us disturbing my repose.

The welcome ring of night overspread the earth the firing died away. And about 11 Oclock P.M. we were called in and retreated across the river and after a good deal of trouble most of us reached our former camp.  That night and laying down slept like logs not withstanding a December rain was pouring upon us in torrents.  Thus closed one of the most disastrous battles of the war. The loss in our regt. was 19 men wounded most of them slightly.  I found Hezekiah still in the regimental hospital and very sick. the hospital was a miserable uncomfortable concern and I had no way in the world to help him to a better situation.  I could only relieve him slightly by seeing that his washing was attended to and trying to cheer him all I could.  I was sick myself which made it worse for both of us.

And the dark foreboding which had hung like a pall over my heart for many months was dispelled. I felt again that I could war if war I must for twenty years against the enemies of my country.

So that at times I came very near striking my officers over the head with my gun. I could not control myself at all. On one occasion when Decker and I were playing at chess one of these fits seized me and I knocked the board and men all over the tents. This lasted me until in the spring I began to carefully read in the New Testament. and I have led a happier life from that day to this.\nAgain we had orders to be ready to move at daylight. But a heavy rain set in which entirely forbade an advance. Several Corps had already moved but were compelled to return, and a more dreary, worn, and miserable looking set of men I have rarely seen. Heavy details were made from some of the regts. to help draw the artilery out of the mire.  This campaign was known in army parlance as \"Burnside Stuck in the Mud.\"  Soon after this Burnside was relieved and Fighting Joe Hooker assumed command of the Army of the Potomac.  In his order assuming command occurred a passage something like this:  \"Let us not hesitate to fight the enemy wherever we can find him.\"  I suggested to some of my comrades that in all probability we could find him.

In the latter part of April the army began its third movement of the Corps. moved up the river and crossed at the upper fords.  But the 6th Corp and our division / the 2d of the 2d army corps. remained where we were.  About the 28th of April the battle commenced up the river.  The 29th the artilery played quite heavily. the 30th we could hear heavy firing nearly all day. The first of May the battle was evidently raging with great fury. On the 2d of May I went on picket. And it was a continuous roar of artilery and even the musketry could be heard though indistinctly. Night came on, a light moonlight night. The battle was not suspended, but the firing sounded nearer.  The soldiers jumped at the conclusion that Hooker was driving the enemy before him toward the river and we would remain there and prevent their crossing. And the rebel army would be ruined.  Hooker stock run up to $1.60 and was readily taken at that enormous advance.  I was hopeful but if I remember right I was not overly elated.

Meanwhile they opened a battery upon us which rendered it somewhat disagreeable remaining about that quarter, we therefore lay down in a rifle pit which they had dug along the river bank. The enemy then brought a battery around to our right flank and opened a brisk fire upon us but our batteries along Stafford Heights replied.  Meanwhile Sedgewick formed his columns the old Ron Brigade in front the general leading in person charged. And sweeping up the heights in the face of a terrible fire of musketry and artilery loaded with canister drove the rebel artilery men from their guns nine of which he captured and several hundred prisoners pursued them about 3 miles.

No sooner were the heights carried than our Engineers were at work rebuilding the railroad bridge.  Gen. Sedgwick retained possession of the heights until on the morn of the 4th of May a rebel column was seen creeping up the river along the base of the heights in his rear, cutting his communication with us and they were quickly in possession of the heights in his rear.

I think that on the following morning Gen. Meades order assuming command was read to us. He used very modest language not promising anything but yet he spoke cheerfully and hopefully.  We had not been long on the march before it became evident that our commander meant \"to make a spoon or spoil a handle.\"  The news of our advance never went before us villagers where they were expecting the rebels every minute were surprised to see the head of our column appear over the hills and descending like a rapid river we would pass through the streets at a rate that was astonishing to any citizen.

As will be clearly demonstrated ere I close the campaign We marched 33 miles by the road which we were compelled to take that day. And secured the heights beyond Union Town and within striking distance of Gettysburg. Next morning an order was read from Gen. Hancock complementing us for our yesterday's march assuring us that it was necessary and we had done a good work which indeed was true.#  After remaining in this place all day the 30th of June we marched early on the morning of the 1st of July toward Gettysburg.\n\nI was ordered on picket immediately after getting into camp and I went cheerfully without swearing a single oath though I cannot say that all my comrades were as successful in restraining their temper as I was on this occasion although I had as bad a temper as any of them. But Berdan was on the same detail and he was always a cheerful soldier. And he and I had always mutually scored to complain at any duty which could be laid upon us.  Berdan was a true Christian and I always observed that Christians were invariably the best soldiers. If there were others as brave there were not as cheerful and patient as them.  The people were all Union in this neighborhood. I saw a women standing with some nice bread in village of Union Town. I approached and asked her to sell me some. She said, \"no I won't - we are union here and thereupon handed me a large piece which I found well buttered. Frankly their little village is rightly named.

The great battle had opened soon Gen. Hancock left us and rode forward to take command of the forces on the field until Meade could arrive in person.  Gen. Reyonalds had already fallen. and the forces were commanded by Howard until such time as Hancock should arrive at the front.  As we pushed forward various stories met us as to how the battle was going.  But any experienced soldier could perceive that if our men were being worsted it had not appeared in the form of a route but that they had retired in good order. else we would have heard wild stories of \"regiments cut to pieces and I'm all the one thats left.\"  No such news reached us. Some said it calmly \"We are getting worsted\" others that it was hard telling which had the worst but all agreed that the battle was opened and that it was bloody.  Finally news reached us that the enemy's advance had been checked and that our forces had captured a rebel brigade.  This I believe was all true.  Being near the field we laid down to wait for morning, which when it came was foggy and drizzling rain. We moved up to our positions.

Our corps which had hitherto been on the right side of the horseshoe now about faced and marched only a few rods over to the left. The couxity[?] of the horse show was Cymetry[?] Hill which was near to the centre of our lines.  And the position which we now occupied was immediately to the left of Cymetry Hill and called the left Centre.  A slight elevation of ground extends like a ridge from Cymetry Hill to a small woody mount[?] on the left of our lines And a similar elevation extends in like manner to a like mount on the right thus our position was like a semicircular wall defended by three towers while just behind us stood one round mount by its self with no ridge extending to it and only affording position for a few guns and would give us but little aid if our first lines were once broken and then it was miles before another position for defence could be formed.  Therefore we must hold the ground or prepare for annihilation.  Soon after our Corps had taken it post the 3d Corp was moving into position and their commander Gen. mistook Gen.

Not 600 yards to their left was a woods. And as we saw them advance the question naturally presented itself to us whether our forces held those woods or not.  Some said they did giving us a reason for thinking so that no General would be fool enough to send that Corp out that way without knowing what was in those woods.  At the same instant the white smoke flew up from twelve pieces of rebel artilery which was posted in the woods.  Their fire exactly enfiladed the noble corps that had thus been carelessly allowed to be ensnared. The report of the guns had not reached us before more than a thousand men exclaimed \"Out generaled again!!!\"  A single battery which had advanced with the corps wheeled into position how they ever got into position was a miracle but one of the men who belonged to the battery afterwards told me that the rebel shot had all passed over their heads and fell among the infantry.  This is highly probable for some of their shots came clear over to where we were nearly a mile from the battery. At any rate they got into position and I believe they did not lose a great many men until after they had got into position.

I hope dates and minor event may be stated more clearly than they have been heretofore and also the exact state of my mind which can never be recorded from memory.  And if any one can read this record and not be utterly sick of human nature he has a better stomach than I. I shall in most cases record the words of the Diary after which I shall make commentaries on each day before I take up the next.  my reason for preserving the exact words is because I can thereby give a clear idea of thoughts as they then passed through my mind.  There are many things, however, recorded in my private diary which are too black for a place in this history yet they are all true and I recorded them with a good design of keeping in memory what a great evil war is and what depths of degradation human natures does descend to in our large Cities.  My own faults and follies that any one may read and take warning as I have remarked before I was a great a sinner as ever not withstanding my partial conviction of the truth of Christianity. But my Journal must explain itself as I proceed and hence I will now open it and copy what was written in those days of war and trial."},{"pageid":87703,"pagefilename":"a0f04e90727ab9037d8f0de17ec9c7bc.jpg","transcription":"104\nDiary of D.

And the other 15000 individuals who have no visible means of support.\nI have a well authenticated instance that occurred in one of the hospitals at Baltimore. A wounded soldier wanted some currant jelly. One of these good nurses told him that he could get him a can for two dollars. the soldier gave it although it was all the money he had. The nurse brought the can to him. and Lo. there was a label on the can showing that the soldiers own mother had sent it to him. and these infernal nurses had stolen the found mother's gift and sold it to her suffering son. I have on it best authority that these scoundrels have been known to quarrel over the body of a dead man for his clothing and other property. And I know myself that every pocket of soldiers killed in battle is rifled in less than fifteen minutes after it is safe to be on the field. If there is one individual more contemptable, meaner, and more deserving of death than all others, it is one of these pick pockets who straggle around among the dead and dying to pilfer. Imagine hundreds of poor wounded men crying for water, for a little help, while near at hand are hordes of these thieves cutting dead men's pockets.  The true solders are at their posts and can not leave them to help the sufferers. But these rogues can and won't.

Not [only?] so, but many comic yarns, far different from our modern comic stories, bearing the impress of ages, really laughable and witty, and this same wit, too, was often mingled in the darkest, wildest stories of supernatural occurences, making a most delightful variation in his narrative, in this he far excelled any novelist I ever read after.

Is it not possible; nay, extremely probable that this long continued battle which has now laster more than a month, has had the effect to bring many to reflect on the uncertainty of human life? I have observed more than once that some hardened sinners will cease swearing and become pensive on the approach of danger others became more reckless than ever.

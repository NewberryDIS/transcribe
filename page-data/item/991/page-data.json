The measures leading to it are certainly equitable, and Just on our part. As the amplitude of Mr Fosters Powers are questionable, this circumstance may have led to an unusual meeting of Congress, in order perhaps, that certain explanations, or demands might be laid before the British Parliment at the begining of their Session I suppose that the ears of the Nation will be astounded by the British advocates in, and out of Congress about the little Bell affair.

When you get this letter, do not feel otherwise than I am perfectly sane & do not unless you think it unsafe to trust my honesty hesitate to comply with my request immediately. I have inquired further into the minutes of the company & believe it to be the best opportunity yet offered to go to California. I shall try the same thing & keep along till I go but I cannot think of going back to Boston or to Warwick till I have tried my fortune in a land tho yet wild, I believe & our first men believe is rich in Gold mines. Our President has been employed by the government, is well acquanted with mineralogy & all are hearty & steady men.

Be cheerful & enjoy the many comforts around you -Your Children, all save one are near you, even that one is near you in thought.

Dear sisters. I return you my sincere thanks for the kind affectionate words contained in your letters; You both write equally sincere--But I think Mary exaggerates when She speaks of spectral image in prospective-There are too many weddings and other lively gatherings to admit of such a probability. Ghosts sup not, with Cupids. They breathe not the same air- so no more ghosts stories Mary I cannot think of any such transformations. Have I then caused so much trouble in our once happy family--I Indeed am sorry to learn such is the case. Well Sisters I ask a thousand pardons. Can you not forgive my silence, for I cannot think myself altogether to blame. I know your humorous hearts will not allow you to retaliate; but forgive & forget, I am indeed sorry I have been instrumental in causing sorrow to steal into the hearts of those I love - let sorrow depart- let your smiles return, dry up thy moistened cheeks & let nought dwell in your young & tender hearts but thoughts buoyant & gay. I feel I have lost much in thus depriving myself of the society & influence of Mother & Sisters. I have hardly spoken to a woman since I left home. Ladies are indeed few and far between; Young Ladies especially; therefore there is no alternative but to associate with my own sex: I think this is a sacrifice. It would be a treat to once more gather together, talk over old times & lifes changing scenes, & as Abby says have a good sing. Well the time may come. I hope so. I Sing some here. I have a violin which I sometimes use, tho' seldom. Sometimes we have quite a good sing. Abby I think you are doing well in teaching, quite persevering. Mary don't tell me what she is about. By the way I think, (speaking of beaux) you may expect a poor gallant in me for I have not walked with, or accompanied any of the fair sex, since I have been in this country. What an awkward beau I must be, of course. I have to take private lessons of Chandler & Sam'l. But enough of this- to be serious I cannot possibly tell when I can best leave to visit you.

I never worked so hard at home but work seems to agree with me especially when I get pay. I don't intend to mine after this year, probably not. You probably think I am not intending to visit home. But I have always been sincere when speaking of coming home. I came very near coming 1st June. I did try to close up & sell out; but after all, I could not arrange it to suit me. I felt sorry but could not help it. I am not getting rich but feel obliged to make the most of the chance I now have.  Once I wanted to get it all but, now, I am not greedy - do not look for a big pile- & shall not try to get it. I intend however to have a little now I am here if I keep my health. So as regards coming home, I would start this morning if I thought I could, & when the time comes round I shall mention it in a letter before I start, so you must not stop writing thinking I am coming home. I expect you think I want to be awful rich, but not so, that is not my luck. Mother may think I don't want to see her--you all may think so but you think wrong if that is the case- You know I want to bring things out right if it does take a good while. And one thing sure my health has been better here than it would have been at home. I wish I had All of your miniatures & I am going to send for them if I stay much longer. I wish you would get mother to sit for hers & keep it for me or send it here.

I read the letter with feelings of joy mingled with grief.  I had not heard of David Paiges death!!  Tis singular. Tis strange. Tis sad indeed. Mr. Paige our friend & Cousin, is then indeed gone! But yet I know nothing concerning his death. Only that he was instantly killed, so says Mary's letter. How mysterious yet who shall escape Death? not one- Our time of departure we can not know. I intended to have Written to Mary particularly but she must excuse me this time & help you read this. Abby speaks of Miss Agnes of Boston. I remember her well: She was a fine girl, a good  page torn  of Mr. Paige, last Winter, or Spring gave me, in his  page torn  some interesting items concerning the coming year & by this time I then expected, to hear Miss Agnes wold be a happy Bride & the Wife of an esteemed friend. Mr. D. Paige who alas has journeyed to the land Where there is no marriages or giving in marriage.\nThe mind cannot refrain from dwelling upon such a coincident not withstanding we would drive the thought away. It seems that Miss Agnes's timidity prevents her from writing to any but lady friends at least I should suppose from Mary's letter. Her extreme modesty though commendable is I think in this aspect uncalled for, Since our former acquaintance though limited, would warrant friendship rather than Coldness & I never think of writing to a lady Sisters & Mother excepted I have almost forgotten that women exist in a home.

I m very glad you concluded to say a word or two. You probably have rec'd a letter from me since you wrote this, enclosed in Mary's letter. If so I need not now explain why the letter you wrote last Summer, (referred to in your last), was unanswered. I am sorry it so happened, but it cannot be helped now. I never have rec'd it and got Mary's & Emily's only a short time since Yours may yet come to hand. But I fear not. Do not let that stop you writing. I will try and answer all. I think you was getting rather too  unclear- spunky?  to resolve not to write. I am willing to admit you had some reason to think your letter was treated with indifference by its not being answered, & probably you thought it the result of gross negligence or coldness. I don't think however, Abby you had sufficient reason to harden your heart & resolve to be silent. Have we not always agreed and always loved each other? Have not our letters (less perhaps than might have been) Yet have not our letters spoken affection. Without knowing a cause why should one cultivate fancied enmity. Even, if as you supposed, my heart had been in a cake of ice do you not know Dear Abby that the fond breathings of a true and affectionate sister would soonest communicate warmth & extricate the palsied heart from its dormant state? O Sister Abby do not think I forget you or wish to check correspondence. My principle enjoyment since I saw you (and that is long long ago) has been in thinking of all my\n[left-hand side]\nNow Dear Sister I have written a letter but a poor one- but I want to have you know that.

I think Sister Maria (I believe that's her name) ought to pull Sam'l Ears today. Poor Chandler--he cannot soon be very cheerful. Give my love to all and keep a bushel for yourself.

I have often regretted being away from my sisters & Brothers  and My Dear Mother. Others too have fondly been remembered.\n\n   Whether my letters be few or many, short or protracted, do not think without a visible cause that I am any other than a true & kindhearted brother. I hope the rest of my life be it short or long will be such that you will entertain no doubts.\n   What the future will be I cannot tell. I hardly know myself what I shall do. When I hear from Chandler I may calculate again with more certainty. I have been away from you and all the folks a long time tis true- but this we all expected of course. There was no chance for me to remain very near you and make anything or be contented. Somewhere then must be my home - hence the world at large has been my home - I have acquired perhaps as much fondness for roaming as others under other circumstances have for a permanent home. I have not since leaving Warwick formed any strong local attachment and therefore the fashion of transient homes in Cal has not been tedious or sacrificing to local feelings. I never thought of being so long away from you without making a visit. Circumstances alone have occasioned my long absence. I have always however been fully aware that this climate was better suited for me than any I have ever been in. Yet had I had any success at all I should have early returned. When I had the hardest times & poorest luck I have said the least as you probably already know. I have a heart to endure much & bear my own misfortune or ill luck. But the kind letters have done much to make me at last many way succesful & I shall ever prize your kind letters. I have toiled hard here.  I never worked so hard in Warwick."},{"pageid":41401,"pagefilename":"7a6ac63a71a9ef51a56d397015aa82af.jpg","transcription":"I have not been very sad or discontented yet much dissatisfied with my succes & having hope, stayed & stayed determined if possible to make enough to have a little home somewhere of my own provided I should live to need one. I first had an intention of going back to boston & go into business if I made a raise here as the saying is but that raise I expected to make in one year or I never should have left for this country with out visiting home- but after getting here & having no success I knew I have to work somewhere & why not be in Cala.\n\n  And so I have studied a long time- yet it is nothing. How many go even a little distance from home & stay years. But others may do as they like it would have suited me to have stepped in and said how de do every day. Of course I should. You all know that I think enough of my old home. It don't seem but a little while since I saw you all after all. and again sometimes it seems an age. You all have got along finely. You have done exceedingly well teaching & so has Mary. You don't get pay enough. You have taught long enough. You ought to rest. I suppose you think I am a curious genius to stay out here so long keeping Old Bachelors hall & I begin to think so myself, but the girls don't bother and head here for there ain't any & so one has to be content with thinking over the names of school gals & etc but fiddlestick every gal I used to know I suppose is saying every day Dear husband Dear this that & tother but I'll stop this nonsense. If I come home I just want to take a good look all round & leave for some other diggins for every thing will be so changed & every body grown & changed that I shall feel lost & wish myself back again.

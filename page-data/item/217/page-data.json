She allowed me to read the part of the letter wherein she described a visit we made some days ago to a nearby temple.  She described the scenery en route - the green fields, the shadowy hills & mts. in the distance - the villages thro' which we passed, the natives young & old whom we saw, and finally the temple & the god . warrior or goblin, I don't know which, roughly carved in outline upon the face of a huge rock. - I told her the story was beautifully written, that it was creditable as a lit. effort but I could not say much for its fidelity to the truth.  I am devoted to the truth always.  I am a regular Gadgrind for facts - grim, stern, incontestable facts.  I believe in the eternal verities, the actualities of this very realistic world.  I would not have the facts disguised by the illusions of fancy, or colored with the variegated hues of a rich imagination. - Lucy, as you know, while perfectly sincere, has such broad sympathies, such indulgent tolerance, & so much poetic inspiration, that she looks at things as it were thro colored glasses.  I look at them with the naked eye.  She sees beauty grace & virtue, where I see only ugliness, depravity & vice.  She see \"richness in dilapidation\".  I see dreary, disintegration. - Now my fidelity to the truth will not permit me to allow even her innocence & unconscious fallacies to be imposed on you as facts.  I feel it incumbent on me to tell you the truth, to paint the picture as it really is. - I do so in no spirit of"},{"pageid":48583,"pagefilename":"103e9818217467f5845f0fd1be052510.jpg","transcription":"2.\n\nharsh criticism, with no desire to provoke family dissension.  I assume that what I shall say will be accepted, with calm acquiescence even by Lucy; & of course you will believe me.  Whatever erroneous impressions you have from Lucy's letter will be at once removed.  There is a temple - so called, I admit.  But such a temple!  Do not allow your imagination to portray some stately shrine, wi pinnacles & cloud-capped towers.  Do not think of solemn dignified priests, wearing richly embroidered robes, bearing golden chalices, carrying burning tapers, or ministering to the aspirations of the finite for the infinite.  Rather think of a old dilapidated shed, with dirty, mud-stained walls, wi dusty mud & broken stone floors wi a roof of broken tiles, thro wh impudent rag weeds push their frowsy heads - Such is the temple.  Then think of some sullen, slouching, shuffling priests, dressed in dirty ragged robes, whose heads are close shaven, in wh dull eyes no gleam of intelligence shines, in wh sodden faces no spirituality appears. Such are the Priests. - There is a Buddha, of course.  A grotesque fig. he is.  He is unduly corpulent.  His eyes are wild and bleary.  He has a strangely familiar look.  I thought I once saw him in the part of Gambrinus, standing with a beer glass in hand, before a saloon on N.

I looked him in the eye but he appeared to avoid me.  I think he recognized me but did not want to admit it so I went out   I think I saw him wink at the priest who operates the drum.  Of that however I am not sure.  He is the divinity of the temple. - This tem. is typical of all the other temples I have seen.  They vary more or less in size & design, but they are all old dirty & dilapidated.  Indeed dirt dust decay & dil. are the universal concomitants of the temples, & a proper emphasis may be given the aforesaid terms by adding thereto as a prefix 2 hyphenated ds (d-d).  - There was a time in the history of the country far back in the dim & dusty centuries when there were artists, architects poets teachers & philosophers among the people.  The artists arch. & poets had imagination, sentiment & inspiration.  They had high, dignified & even poetic conceptions of life.  They tried to express these conceptions in noble towers & tombs and temples.  They had a keen sense of color, of ambitious designs, of high & lofty proportions & of beautiful detail.  They succeeded in a very respectable & impressive way.  They builded? well.  But these artists are long since dead.  The artistic spirit died with them.  They had no successors.  The only memory of them their country has is in these ruins of a former greatness.

No effort is made in the same line; there are no new creations, & the old is allowed to go to ruin.  The mildew of decay & the dust of decadent years are over towers, temples, palaces & tombs alike.  The weeds? grow thick over tessallated? walks; shrubs push their way into the crevices between the marbles.  There is no sense of order, cleanliness, repair or preservation. - The cities & villages, in dirt & dust in decay & dilapidation are in complete harmony with the towers & temples.  The buildings are uniformly low & of but one storey & w almost flat tiled roofs.  In the country & in the city quite generally, the dwellings are inclosed w a high wall; the enclosure is called a compound.  It must be a hereditary instinct that prompts them to thus enclose their houses.  An instinct born of ancient tribal wars, of Tartar invasions, & of Mongolian forays.  The instinct of danger, of the protection from mud, stone or sun-baked brick walls seem to be universal. - The streets are irregular in boundaries & on the surface.  There is no grade, no sidewalks.  The streets have hills valleys holes & ruts.  They are full of children, dogs, hogs, & piles of rubbish.  Old women sit in groups about the doorways leading into the compound.  They smoke long pipes & may be presumed to be gossiping about their neighbors.  I often wonder what they talk about.  It can't be about the fashions because there has been no change in the fashions for more than a thous. years.  It can't be about church sociables, tea or bridge parties or dances.  It cannot be about the romance of courtships or the ups & downs of affairs of love.

They are usually fat and dirty.  A bath wd give them a shock beyond endurance.  A bar of soap wd. be an inscrutable mystery.  While I can't say much for them, I am not disposed to say anything against them.  The innocence & helplessness of childhood disarms criticism. - The streets abound in dogs - mean dirty wolfish dogs.  As you enter upon a street you see them sleeping in unclear dust on every hand.  The sight, the scent of a foreigner disturbs.  They seem sharply to discriminate bet. natives & for.  They growl & bark & bow their backs like angry cats.  They are cowards.  The sight of a stick makes them slink into their compounds.  After the traveller passes by, they come out and abuse him w all the vile epithets known to the canine language.  I don't always know what they say, but I have a fairly good idea of what they mean.  Some day I am going to write an extended article on these native dogs.  I am gathering the data now:  it is largely composed of lurid adjectives. - Then there are the hogs.  In appearance they look like demons just escaped from the lower world.  They are black, long haired, [bowed?]] back, long tailed creatures w. such long snouts that they suggest kinship with the crocodile family.

They attend to their own business & they seem to have plenty of business to do.  As they do me no harm I will say no more about them.  The scenery on the way to the little temple is beautiful I admit.  That is the fields are attractive.  This is the land of \"intense farming.\"  The natives are good agriculturists.  But they severally cultivate such small patches - just an acre or so.  They do the work by hand; they have no ploughs, rakes, seeders, cultivators, etc.  Armed wi a hoe or an old-styled instrument that I wd call a mattock, they do all  their work.  The kao-liang seems to be the principal crop in this section, wi beans and millet added.  We are not in the tea or rice or cotton section of the country.  The kao-liang when small looks like our Ill. corn.  I was sure it was corn.  But it grows very tall like our broom corn & has a wide spread tassel at the top.  The natives have stripped off the leaves almost to the top, so that the long rows of the slender, stripped stalks, look like the serried ranks of an army of soldiers, their plumes nodding & waving in the summer air.  There are no fences, hedges or ditches separating the several patches.  They are one great field.  The surface of the country around here is varied; there are hills & valleys & plains; all under the highest cultivation.  The mountains in the distance are unusual in their appearance.  They are as a rule a succession of single mts. w. cone-like peaks; but here others are irregular formations wh are quite pic.; against the sky they look like broken clouds.

They wind & twist their way over broader trails, wh for the horrible condition they are in wd. make an Amer. farmer crazy.  These roadways are few and far bet.  They are full of deep gullies & ruts.  No one ever thinks of grading or draining or working them.  The carts are pulled by donkeys & mules.  The other day I saw a mule a cow & a donkey hitched to & pulling the same cart.  I do have a large measure of int. in these poor, patient industrious farmers.  They live in the little villages.  There are no single farm houses or cottages as with us.  The same instinct that prompts them to build mud walls around their houses, their villages & cities also prompts the to live in village groups.  Each day they travel thru? several winding paths thro the fields from the villages to their own respective patches of ground.  They are such an industrious, patient, poverty-stricken lot.  I can't help thinking what their lives have been & contrasting the same wi that of a corresponding class in our country from our point of view what a cheerless life theirs has been & is.

They never heard a blessing or whispered a prayer.  Such are the temples, priests & gods; such are the villages & the people.  The foregoing is a crude, imperfect picture, but it is true in outline and color.  There is little room for sentiment, little play for the imagination.  And yet these people are not wholly unhappy.  They know no better life.  A failure of a crop means starvation.  So if they have a good crop, they are content.  Their patient industry, their quiet contentment are their saving graces.  In many ways, I like them.  Everybody seems to like them.  Their lives are of little account to themselves, their families or their country.

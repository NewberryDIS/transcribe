Great lassitude and emaciation resulted from this severe discipline, and thus they were in some measure prepared for the self-inflicted torture to which they were afterwards subjected.

There were also four sacks, each containing some three or four gallons of water, which seemed to be objects of superstitious regard, constructed, with much labour and ingenuity, from the skin of the neck of the buffalo, sewed together in the form of large tortoises lying on their backs; to each there was a kind of drum-stick by which they were beaten, forming a sort of musical instrument for their strange dances.  By the sides of these sacks, which were called ECH-TE-KA, there were lying two other articles of equal importance, called ECK-NA-DE, rattles made of dried skins, in the form of a gourd shell, which were also used as music for the same purpose.

The chief actors in these strange scenes were eight men loosely covered with the entire skins of buffaloes with the horns and tails attached.  The dancers looked through the holes of the eyes of the skin as through a mask, and throughout preserved the horizontal position, by which they were enabled more closely to imitate the motions of the buffalo.  They were all naked, and painted in the most extraordinary manner with black, red and white paint.  Each of them had also a lock of buffalo's hair tied around the ankles. In the right hand he had a rattle and in the left hand a slender staff about six feet long; and on his back he carried a bunch of willow boughs of the ordinary size of a bunch of straw.  These eight men being divided into four couples, took their positions on the four sides of the Ark or Big Canoe; representing thereby the four cardinal points, and between each of these groups was another figure engaged in the same dance, keeping the step with the eight buffaloes and with a similar staff and a rattle, four in all.

There were, moreover, a great number of characters, who represented various animals, who added materially to the effect of this strange scene.  First, close by the side of the Big Canoe, there were two men who wore the skins of grissly bears, with the skins covering their faces as masks.  These characters, called \"grisly bears,\"  were continually growling and threatening to devour everything before them, and interfering with the forms of the ceremony.  To appease them and keep them quiet, the women were constantly bringing them dishes of meat, which were placed before them, and as often snatched away and carried to the prairies by two men called \"bald eagles,\" whose bodies and limbs were painted black, and their heads and feet white.  These in their turn were chased upon the prairies by scores of small boys, with their bodies and limbs painted yellow, and their heads"},{"pageid":66990,"pagefilename":"602dfc834a331caabe22aa201126e4cc.jpg","transcription":"15.\nand feet white, wearing a tail of white deers' hair, and, these were called \"antelopes.\"  At length they succeeded in getting hold of the dishes of meat from the bald eagles and ate it. Besides these, two men represented swans; their bodies were painted white, and their noses and feet black.  Two others men called \"rattlesnakes,\" whose bodies were curiously painted to imitate that reptile each holding a bunch of wild sage in his hands.  Two \"beavers\" were represented by two men entirely covered excepting their heads, with buffalo robes, the fur worn outside, with beaver's tails attached to their girdles.  The two \"vultures\" had their bodies naked, and their heads and shoulders painted blue.  The two \"wolves\" were painted white, and wore white wolf skins; they pursued the antelopes, and whenever they overtook one the grisly bears came up and devoured it.  All these characters very closely imitated the habits of the animals which they represented, and each had some peculiar and appropriate song, which was constantly sung and chanted during these dances.  These strictly \"medicine\" songs are kept a profound secret even from people of their own tribe, excepting such as are regularly initiated therein at an early age, and for which an exorbitant price is paid.

The beavers clapped with their tails, the beavers struck with their paws, the buffaloes rolled in the sand, or leaped on their feat, and all danced off together into an adjoining lodge where they remained in a curious and picturesque group until the master of ceremonies again summoned all the dancers and group of animals to gather round him.

But, in the midst of the last dance on the fourth day, a sudden alarm throughout the group announced the arrival of a strange character from the West.

At this moment, a man advanced and withdrew the two upper splints, by which the suspension had been effected. All the other splints were allowed to remain in, and these were got rid of in the manner yet to be described. No one was allowed to offer any aid to the sufferers while they remained in this condition; they were here enjoying the invaluable privilege of entrusting their lives to the Great Spirit, and there they were to remain until the Great Spirit gave them strength to get up and walk away.

Some famous men of the tribe were also shown to me who, as proved by the corresponding scars and mutilations, had gone through these horrid ordeals six or seven times. It seemed that no care was taken of the wounds thus made, and that neither bleeding nor inflammation to any extent ensued, which was owing, probably, to the checked circulation and reduced condition consequent upon their four days' fasting and abstinence. During the whole time of this cruel part of the ceremony, the chiefs and dignitaries of the tribe were carefully making their observations, to enable them to decide who amongst the different candidates should prove the hardiest and most stout-hearted; who could hang the longest without fainting, or who was the soonest up after he had fainted, that they might judge whom to appoint to lead a war party, or to whom the most important posts should be assigned,\nAs soon as six or eight has passed through"},{"pageid":67004,"pagefilename":"b987e9f3c77c5876ed2592f2abd0928e.jpg","transcription":"29. the ordeal, they were led out of the lodge with the weights still hanging to their flesh, and dragging on the ground, where still more painful suffering awaited them.

Thus they ran with them as fast as they could around the Big Canoe, the buffalo skulls and other weights still hanging and dragging on the ground, amidst the deafening shouts of the by-standers, whose voices were raised to the highest key, in order to drown the cries of the poor sufferers. This part of the ceremony is what is called ESH-KE-NAH-KA-NAH-PIC, or the \"Last Race,\" and the ambition of the young aspirants was here to decide who could run the longest under the circumstances without fainting. So much were they exhausted, however, from abstinence and pain, that the greater portion of them fainted before they had run half the circle, but were violently dragged, even with their faces in the dirt, until every weight attached to their flesh was left behind.

Brandt on the 7th of July 1793. _ \n“Niagara 8th,, July 1793.”\n“Brothers—you told us that the people whom we saw here, were sent to represent the Indian Nations who own the Lands on the northern side of the Ohio, as their common property [2 words underline]; & who are all of one mind—one heart.” \n“Brothers—we now come to the second point: whether we are properly authorized to have & establish a new boundary line between your land & ours?” \n“Brothers. We answer explicitly that we have that authority. Where this line should run will be the great subject of discussion at the treaty between you & us: & if we sincerely hope & expect that it may then be fixed to the satisfaction of both parties._  Doubtless some concessions must be made one both sides. In all disputes & quarrels both parties usually take some wrong steps; so that it is only by mutual concessions that a true reconcilement can be effected.”_ \n“Brothers- we wish you to understand us clearly on this head; for we mean that all our proceedings should be marked with candour. We therefore repeat & say explicitly, that some concessions will be necessary on your part as well as on ours, in order to establish a just & permanent peace.”\n\n         Extract from Capt.

But before we do this, we think it necessary to look back to foure former transactions; & we desire you patiently to hear us. ~\n\"Brothers - We do know very well, that at the treat of Fort Stanwix, 25 years age, the river Ohio was agreed on as the boundary line between you & the white people of the British Colonies. And we all know that about fewer years after that boundary was fixed, as quarrel broke out between your father, the King of G.B & the people of those Colonies, which are now the U.S. - This quarrel warended by the treat of peace made with the King about ten years ago, by which the Great Lake & the waters which unite them were by him declared to be the boundaries of the U.S. ~ \n\"Brothers - Peace having been they made between the King of G. B & the U.S., if remained to make peace between them & the Indian Nation who had taken part with the King. For this purpose Commissioners were appointed, who lent mepages to all there Indian Nations, inviting them to come & make peace. The first treat was held about 9 years ago at Fort Stanwix, with the Six Nations; which has stood firm & inviolated to this day. The next treaty was made about ninety days after, at Fort mcMutosle with the Half King and the Wyandots baps. Pike & the other chiefs in behalf of the Wyandot, Elsware, Ottawa & Chippewa Nations. Afterwards treaties were made with divers Indian Nations, South of the Ohio River; & the next treaty ws made with Kakiapilathy, here present & other Shawanoe chiefs, in behalf of the Shawanoe nation, as the mouth of the Great miami which runes into the Ohio. - \n\"Brother, - The commissioners who conducted there treaties in behalf of the U.S. sent the papers containing them to the great council of the States, who, supposing them satisfactory to the nations treated with, procceded to dispose of large tracts of the lands thereby ceded; & a great number of people removed from other parts of the U.S. & settled upon them - Also many families of your antient father, the French came over the great water and settled upon a part of some lands. \n\"Brothers - After some time it appeared that a number of people in your nations were dissatisfied with the treaties of Fort McIntosh & Miami. Therefore the Great Council of the U.S. appointed Gov Hlair their commissioner with full powers for the purpose of removing all causes of controversy, regulating trade & settling boundaries between the Indian Nations in the Northern department of the U.S. - He accordingly sent messages inviting all the Nations concerned to enact him a Council Fire which he kindles at the falls of Muskingum. While he was waiting for them, some mischief happened at the place, & the fires was put out. So he kindled a Council fire at For Harwar, where near six hundred Indians of different Nations, attiuded the Six Nations then renewed & confirmed the treaty of Fort Stanwix; & the Wyandots & Deawares renewed & confirmed the treaty of For McIntosh.

We have also the Speeches of many Chiefs who attended them & who voluntarily declared their Satisfaction with the terms of those treaties.\n\"Brothers - After making all these treaties, & after hearing the Chiefs freely express their satisfaction with them, the U. S. expected to enjoy peace, & quietly to hold the lands ceded by them.  Accordingly large tracts have been sold & settled, as before mentioned.  And now Brothers, we answer explicitly, that for the reasons here stated to you, it is impossible to make the river Ohio the boundary between your people & the people of the U. S.-\n\"Brothers - You are men of understanding, & if you consider the customs of white people, the great expences which attend their settling in a new Country, the nature of their improvements in building houses & barns, & clearing & fencing their lands, how valuable the lands are thus rendered, & then how dear they are to them; you will see that is is now impracticable to remove our people from the northern side of the Ohio.  Your Brothers, the English, know the nature of white people, & they know, that under the circumstances which we have mentioned, the U. S. cannot make the Ohio the boundary between you & us.\n\"Brothers - You seem to consider all the lands in dispute on your side of the Ohio, as claimed by the U. S., but suffer us to remind you, that a large tract was sold by the Wyandot & Delaware nations to the State of Pennsylvania.  This tract is East of a line drawn from the mouth of Beaver Creek at the Ohio, due north to Lake Erie.  This line is the western boundary of Pennsylvania, as claimed under the charger given by the King of England to your antient friend William Penn.- Of this sale made by the Wyandot & Delaware Nations to the State of Pennsylvania we have never heard any complaint.\n\"Brothers - We are on this occasion obliged to make a long speech.  We again desire you to hear us patiently, the business is of the highest importance; & a great many words are necessary fully to explain it; for we desire you may perfectly understand us:  And there is no danger of your forgetting what we say, because we will give you our speech in writing.\n\"Brothers - We have explicitly declared to you, that we cannot now make the Ohio river the boundary between us.  This agrees with our speech to your Deputies at Niagara, \"that \"in order to establish a just & permanent peace, some concessions would be necessary on your \"part as well as on ours.\"-\n\"Brothers - The concessions which we think necessary on your part are, that you yield up &  finally relinquish to the U. S. some of the Lands on your side of the river Ohio.  The U. S. wish to have confirmed all the lands ceded to them by the Treaty of Fort Harmar; & also a small tract of land at the Rapids of the Ohio, claimed by Gen. Clarke for the use of himself & his warriors:  And in consideration there of, the U. S. would give such a large sum in money or goods as was never given at one time, for any quantity of Indian lands, since the white people first set their feet on this Island.  And because those lands did every year furnish you with Skins & furs, with which you bought clothing & other necessaries, the U.

S. now listen to another, of a claim which has probably more disturbed your minds than any other whatever.\n\"Brothers - The Commissioners of the U. S. have formerly set up a claim to your whole Country Southward of the Great Lakes, as the property of the U. S.: grounding this claim on the treaty of peace with your father the King of G. B., who declared as we have before mentioned, the middle of those Lakes & the waters which unite them to be the boundaries of the U. S.-\n\"Brothers - We are determined that our whole conduct shall be marked with openness & sincerity.  We there fore frankly tell you, that we think those Commissioners put an erroneous construction on that part of our treaty with the King.  As he had not purchased the Country of you, of course he could not give it away.  He only relinquished to the U. S. his claim to it.  That claim was founded on a right acquired by treaty with other white nations, to exclude them from purchasing or settling in any part of your Country:  & it is this right which the King granted to the U. S. - Before that grant the King alone had a right to purchase of the Indian Nations any of the lands between the Great Lakes, the Ohio & the Mississipi, excepting the part within the charter boundary of Pennsylvania; & the King by the treaty of peace, having granted this right to the U. S., they alone have now the right of purchasing.  So that now, neither the King nor any of his people, have any right to interfere with the U. S. in respect to any pat of those lands.  All your Brothers the English, know this to be true: & it agrees with the declaration of Lord Dorchester to your Deputies two years ago at Quebec.-\n\"Brothers - We now concede this great point. We by the express authority of the President of the U. S. acknowledge the property or right of Soil, of the great Country above described to be in the Indian Nations, so long as they desire to occupy the same.  We only claim particular tracts in it, as before mentioned & the general right granted by the King, as above stated, & which is well known to the English and Americans, & called the right of pre-emption, or the right or purchasing of the Indian Nations, disposed to sell their lands, to the exclusion of of all other white people whatever.-\n\"Brothers - We have now opened our hearts to you.  We are happy in having an opportunity of doing it: tho' we should have been more happy to have done it in the full Council of your Nations.  We expect soon to have this satisfaction;  & that your next deputation will take us by the hand & lead us to the Treaty when we meet & converse with each other freely we may more easily remove any difficulties which may come in the way of peace.\"\n\n                      At Capt.

While he was waiting for them some mischief happened at that place & the fire was put out.  So he kindled a Council fire at Fort Marmar, where near Six hundred Indians of different Nations attended.  The Six Nations then renewed & confirmed the Treaty of Fort Stanwix; & the Wyandots & Delawares renewed & confirmed the Treat of Fort McIntosh.  Some Ottawas, Chippewas, Pattawatamies & Sacs were also parties to the treaty of Fort Harmar.-\n\"Now Brothers, these are your words; & it is necessary for us to make a short reply to them.-\n\"Brothers - A General Council of all the Indian Confederacy was held, as you well know in the fall of the year 1788 at this place:  And that General Council was invited by your Commission Gov. St. Clair, to meet him for the purpose of holding a treaty with regard to the lands mentioned by you to have been ceded by the treaties of Fort Stanwix & Fort McIntosh.-\n\"Brothers - We are in possession of the Speeches & letters that passed on that occasion between those deputed by us, the confederated Indians & Gov. St. Clair, the Commissioner of the U. S.  These papers prove that your said Commissioner, in the beginning of the year 1789, after having been informed by the General Council of the preceeding fall, that no bargain or Sale of any part of these Indian lands, would be considered as valid or binding, unless agreed to by a General Council, nevertheless, persisted in collecting together a few Chiefs of two or three nations only, & with them held a Treaty for the Cession of an immense Country, in which they were no more interested, than as a branch of the General Confederacy, & who were in no manner authorized to make any grant or cession whatever.-\n\"Brothers - How then was it possible for you to expect to enjoy peace & quietly to hold these lands, when your Commissioner was informed long before he held the treaty of Fort Harmer, that the consent of a General Council was absolutely necessary to convey any part of these lands to the U. S.?   The part of these lands which the U. S. now wish us to relinquish, & which you say you are settled, have been sold by the U. S. since that time.-\n\"Brothers - You say, \"The U.

We desire you to consider, Brothers, that our only demand, is the peaceable possession of a small part of our once great Country.  Look back & view the lands from whence we have been driven to this spot.  We can retreat no further; because the Country behind hardly affords food for its present inhabitants.  And we have therefore resolved to leave our bones in this small space to which we are now confined.\n\"Brothers - We shall be persuaded that you mean to do us justice, if you agree that the Ohio shall remain the boundary line between us:  If you will not consent thereto, our meeting will be altogether unnecessary:   This is the great point which we hoped would have been explained before you left your homes; as our message last fall was principally directed to obtain that information.\"-\nDone in General Council, at the foot of the Miamis Rapids, the 13th day of August 1793-\nNations [underline]\nWyandots-                                 Chippewas-                      Mohickens-\nSeven Nations of Canada          Serrikas of the Glaize        Messasaques-   \nDelawares-                                Pattawatamies-                  Creeks-\nShawanoes-                              Counoys-                           Cherokees-\nMiamis-                                     Munsces-\nOttawas-                                   Nantikokus-"},{"pageid":55996,"pagefilename":"4069215e317f6aeb224b241a05afaa70.jpg","transcription":"10\nTo the foregoing answer of the Indian Nations, the Commissioners immediately made the following reply, I delivered it to the two Wyandot runners who brought the answer.-\n\n    \"To the Chiefs & Warriors of the Indian Nations assembled at the foot of the Mismis Rapids.\"\n    \" Brothers, we have just recd your answer, dated the 13th inst. to our speech of the 31st of last month, which we delivered to your Deputies at this place.  You say it was interpreted to all your Nations; & we presume it was fully understood.  We therein explicitly declared to you, that it was now impossible to make the river Ohio the boundary between your lands & the lands of the U. S.  Your answer amounts to a declaration that you will agree to no other boundary than the Ohio.  The negociation is therefore at an end.  We sincerely regret that peace [underline] is not the result, but knowing the upright & liberal views of the U. S., which as far as you gave us an opportunity, we have explained to you, we trust that impartial judges will not attribute the continuance of the war to them.\"\n    Done at Capt.

I suppose they would be willing to take care of the stock for priveledge of the house and horse.  Has Robbie got a horse?  It would not be necessary to give him terms for the use of the farm next year at present.  You might take more time to think of that.  You would want to reserve the priveledge of coming back any time in the winter and if you should return before spring you would want some of the rooms.  You would know best what rooms to reserve in that case.  I think it very probable that you would do better to rent the farm to Robbie next summer than to try to work it, but it will be time enough by & by to talk of that."]},{"pageid":37232,"pagefilename":"41bef743d2b31200b9215f2d4f765264.jpg","transcription":["I am sorry to learn that Mary does not gain faster.

She tries to be careful about taking cold &c.\nWhat progress is being made with the cofiant?  I think that notice on the cover of the cenhadwr ought to be taken off and another inserted stating about when it will be ready &c.

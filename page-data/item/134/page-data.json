Tell Jenny that I am very glad to hear that her sketch of an eye is better, I should think from her description that she must look truly beautiful. A purple eye! How pretty! I had a very pleasant visit from Cousin Thomas, although a very short one. If he had come five minutes later I should have lost his visit almost if not entirely, as I was just on the point of taking my bath which if I had taken would have made me unable to talk much if any for an hour or two and he only staid about an hour and a half.

But I will tell you what else I saw; I saw four men walking along the plank sidewalk, and two ladies; and then I saw four sleighs and two dogs!

It was the first time I had been in there, although I have been at the Water Cure so long. I guess I staid in there half an hour; it does seem so good to go any where out of my own room. I saw a good many new things; at least, they looked strange and new to me, but if I should try to tell you about them perhaps you would laugh to think I was so simple and childish.

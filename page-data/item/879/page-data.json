For should I become involved or die involved, my creditors could come upon my portion of the property for my debts? and as soon as I can hear from home, and obtain the necessary information particularising the property, the deed will be forwarded to mother to be placed on record, in the proper office.  I wish I had 30? times as much to give her.  I would die just that much the better contented.  For I have a profession that has not failed to yield me a support as yet, and when it does I have a pair of hands which are as able to work, as they were three years ago.  We have invested some means in loosing operations in the way of mining, but the one we are engaged in at present I hope will more than remunerate us for what we have lost, though all mining operations are more or less uncertain.

It found us all enjoying most excellent health, which has been our good fortune as a general thing ever since we came to the country.  We returned to this place nearly 3 months ago but have not thus far been near so fortunate as we were on the Yuba River & in fact we have been sinking money more or less ever since we came down here the last time.  We have shares now in a water & mining company which will soon be in operation, we completed our part of the work yesterday we take the water from this place, in a ditch or canal, to the next mining town below, a distance of nearly 7 miles.  If the Diggins there are as rich as it is supposed they are it will be as profitable an investment as we could have made, on the same amount of capital for besides getting water for our own mining operations, each shareholder will have more or less water to sell to other miners.  We expect to move down as soon as the water gets there; so that we can go to mining.  We have spent a good deal of time in prospecting for Quartz veins & the company discovered one some weeks ago, that is supposed\n[written along left margin]\nof any proffits accruing, & in such case whatever it might be I told mother & sister to receive it & appropriate it to their use & seeing the advertisement, I casually mentioned the matter in a letter home for I thought it even more likely that they would also see the advertisement than that I should & I know that if they did unless they knew something about, the cause they might be uneasy & think strange after what had passed on the subject\n[written along top margin]\nI am sorry that the matter has been so misconstrued and am still more surprised to think you should think that I did it out of any ill will towards you for nothing was farther from my mind.  I cant see that I have done any thing in the matter that is not compatible with strict principles of honor.  I remarked that I supposed it was your choice for the land to be sold in that way, from the fact that I supposed it had probably depreciated in value & never intimated that it was in consequence of any pecuniary embarrassment or any thing of the kind, and as to doing it with the intention of making public your business matters, as you supposed, I never dreamed of any such thing For I suppose they know as much as they do from anything I may have told? them"},{"pageid":55586,"pagefilename":"f2199effae35da4e31788e3cb405e154.jpg","transcription":"to be rich, But whether it will pay for working at the present prices of machinery labour &c or not is yet to be decided and in fact that is the case with nearly every species of mining, you have to risk a good deal in order to make any thing of consequence.  Gold mining from beginning to end is a perfect gambling business, if you loose at all you are very apt to loose all you invest & if you make any thing it is apt to be something worth having; a miner may be rich to day and in a few weeks he may not be worth a dollar and work like a negro all the time.  I have not done any thing at my profession since we left Washington; for it is rather inconvenient to attend to the Practice of Physic & dig in the earth at the same time; we will continue, mining as long as we remain in the country.\nWe reced a letter from Mother yesterday, they had not heard of the death of Corydon Oliver; poor fellow he struggled hard in this country, to indemnify himself for his trip and after going through all that he did it seems hard for him to be cut off when so near the goal to which he was anxiously hastening.  The health of this country generally, is very good & the the climate surpasses any I ever experienced.  If every thing else in this country equaled the climate I should be conted to remain here as long as I live.\nBut so long as the gold mines are here, just so long will society be corrupt.  I was perfectly astounded when I heard of the affair between yourself & Stille, for I thought, he above all others would be the last man to injure you in any way, & ?less be guilty of the charges alleged against him; it appears that we know no one untill we have tried them fully & even\n[written along left margin]\nI feel convinced that you will think differently of the matter after the explanations above made and that this will be the last misunderstanding of the kind that will ever occur between us.

But it is almost proverbial for the Californians to entertain a very poor opinion of human nature & in reality they have sufficient cause for men in this country who stood fair in the States?; will steal, swindle & in short do any thing for a little gold dust.  I have never seen or heard of Stille in this country but if he ever should approach me, I shall most certainly give him cause to remember me.  I think if he has come to this country, that he has taken up his quarters in San Francisco or Sacramento City where he can better carry on his villainous schemes.\nI recd a letter a short time ago from Mr Chapman, he was well and wished to be remembered to you, both, he is also mining & has done tolerably well only & expects to remain for 12 months longer.  I shall return to the States this fall if I live, as soon as the sickly season is over on the Isthmus which will be probably some time in November.\nJack & Frank talk of remaining a little longer, though they are not determined.

Aunt Sophia, I hardly know how to thank you for the kind admonitions, contained in your letter, but you may rest assured that they will not soon be forgotten; on the contrary we will treasure them up and try to profit by them, for there is not place in the world, where good advice from a friend, is more needed than it is here.  There is no restraint whatever upon the actions of men & the greatest wonder wonder is that affairs are not worse than they are.  As a sample of the way things are carried on I will give you a specimen of what I saw on last Sunday afternoon, Sunday you must know is the principle business day of the week.  On one square in the main business part of the city -- a minister mounted an empty goods box to preach a sermon to the crowd, as he said he could not get a congregation large enough to preach to at the church which was recently erected & while he was preaching 3 large gambling houses with splendid bands of music were in full blast within a few doors & the gingling of the specie on the monte tables & the sound of the music formed a strange contrast when compared with the voice of the minister preaching to the motley crowd in the open street while from numerous waggons loaded with goods men were auctioneering off the remnants of their stock.  The next thing worthy of note was a crowd rushing out of one of the gaming houses pell mell some drunk & some sober, some bloody and others with their coats off ready for a fight, which had been commenced in the house and as usual ends in the street.  Such scenes as these and many others are nothing unusual; of a Sunday more especially, but you can have no proper conception of these things unless you were here to see for yourself & that of course would be the last thing you would think of.\nJack & Frank wish to be remembered most affectionately to you both & say they will write soon.

I think uncle Harvey, if I know myself as I believe I do that you laboring under a false impression in regard, to the reference, made to the sale of the Columbia Property, in one of my letters home & I think you will certainly be of a different opinion when the matter is explained, for I am not in the habit of doing things underhandedly or without an assignable cause or reason, and as to my being ungenerous or ungrateful to you or any one else for any favours or assistance, I may have recived & more especially as it regards yourself, for you ought to know me well enough, to know that I shall allways (let my circumstances in life be what they may) consider myself largely indebted to you in point of gratitude at least.  I will here give you the reason why I did it & hope it will be satisfactory.  When I was starting to California last spring after I had told mother & sister the actual state of my affairs, they asked me as well as I can recollect, if I had any thing left in Cincinnati & I told them I had not but that some time during the fall or winter previous you had offered me 60 or 100$ for my services or interest of 20 per cent on the proffits & that I told you, (which you probably recollect) that I thought you would not be doing justice to yourself to give that much & so the matter rested.  I then told them that when you sold the lots, if they paid a proffit amounting to anything of consequence over & above expenses & if your other land speculations proved very profitable & you saw proper to allow me any thing on it you could do so, but that of course was to be discretionary with you for I did not consider you indebted to me at all.  But in the event of my death before my return & in case I should leave no effects, you could allow me something, if you saw proper in case \n[written along left margin]\nWhen you write direct to Sacramento City as before and we will get the letter from there by Express."},{"pageid":55594,"pagefilename":"867ca6bda20cc2be6a9f51a15c15b168.jpg","transcription":"Crescent City Hotel,\nSacramento City, California, August 27th 1850\nDear Aunt,\nI hardly know whether I ought to write to you or Uncle Harvey at all or not, as I have written to both of you several times since I left the Queen City & have never recd the first scratch of a pen from any of you & in fact I have not reced a line even from home.

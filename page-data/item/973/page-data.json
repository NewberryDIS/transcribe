And Whereas, notwithstanding the repeated Instructions which have been from Time to Time given by our late Royal Grandfather to the Governors of our several Colonies upon this Head, the said Indians have made, and do still continue to make, great complaints, that Settlements have been made, and Possession taken of Lands, the Property of which, they have by Treaties reserved to themselves, by Persons claiming the said Lands under Pretence of Deeds of Sale, and Conveyance, illegally, fraudulently, and surreptitiously obtained of the said Indians; and whereas it has likewise been represented unto us, that some of our Governors, or other chief Officers of our said Colonies, regardless of the Duty they owe to us, and of the Welfare and Security of our Colonies, have countenanced such unjust Claims and Pretentions, by passing Grants of the Lands so pretended, to have been purchased of the Indians.

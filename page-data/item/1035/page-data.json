Kearney.\n              To go into the history of all the rascalities practised in this country by the employees of the Quartermaster's department would require more time and space than I can devote now to the subject, and I shall only mention, the most glaring irregularities, and those that I think can be remedied in a great degree by the proper attention on the part of the different Quartermasters and the Commanding offices of Posts, and I do not presume to dictate what course should be pursued by other commanding officers than myself.\n                The class of men employed now by the Quartermasters Department is certainly, the worst I ever came in contact with, and the amount of pillaging and open robbery committed by them"},{"pageid":69388,"pagefilename":"8339b03eff653a59096de8300aa00f08.jpg","transcription":"is almost incredible.  A few of the many cases perfectly established, - I will mention to shew to what a desperate state things have arrived:  One man employed here as superintendent of the Mai line deliberately took several hundred dollars worth of provisions - drawn for employees on the line - and sold them to a Ranchman;  another man employed at the Saw Mill ran away with sixteen mules, a wagon master took the corn issued for his train, and sold it to a Ranchman for whiskey; another man employed to Carry the mail deserted his mail, and ran away with the whole of the ambulance team Another man employed in the responsible position of yard Master deliberately stole a saddle from a citizen, and I have every reason to believe that he stole a pistol from another citizen, both of the stolen articles were found in his possession.  Another wagon master stated that two mules were shot by Indians, and died, that a steer was also shot by Indians, when it has been discovered that the mules have disappeared, doubtless stolen, and that the Steer was butchered and eaten by the Quartermaster's men.  Quite a number of these villains have been caught purchasing arms from soldiers &c, &c.

I found many of them here in the employ of General Dandy when I arrived here, and they were retained by Colonel Camp, and then turned over to the present Post Quartermaster major Grines, who will I feel satisfied to all in his power to rid the service of these bad characters.  He has diminished the number of his employees somewhat, but I think the list might be made much smaller still.\n    It is impossible to punish these characters here, although there is a United States Commissioner here, there is no deputy Marshal to take charge of prisoners and carry them to the Territorial Capital at Yankton, and all he (The Commissioner) can do is to request me to keep them in confinement.   If they are simply discharged from the employ of the Quartermaster here, they turn up as teamsters employed by some other Post by some Quartermaster who hires them without even asking anything of their previous history"},{"pageid":69390,"pagefilename":"1e9d5ed780d0f825ea49b67c8d9476a2.jpg","transcription":"or character.  One man a Wagon master is caught today purchasing arms of a soldier, and I find that he has spent a good portion of his time in the Guard house at Fort Sanders for thieving.  The man who ran away with the sixteen mules, a week or two since was employed by the Quartermaster here without recommendation from any one, and I think he had only been employed a few days when he ran away.  And if I should order the discharge of the whole batch of these creatures, I would be obliged to detail soldiers to do the labor, and there is now a citizen employee borne one the rolls of Quartermasters men at this Post for every Soldier for duty at the Post.  And here I beg to remark that I am never consulted in any way as to who shall be employed, or the number to be employed.  At this Post there are five [underline] clerks employed, besides a storekeeper with an assistant, and Master of transportation, eleven wagon masters, and various other employees in all amounting to nearly three hundred men     There are two little boys employed as messengers in the Quartermaster's Office at $45 per month and a ration, when either of the little fellows ought to be glad (and doubtless would be) to receive $10 per month.

If we run a Saw Mill, we must have the requisite number of men for that, but I suspect if we take the price at which lumber will be furnished from Denver, and multiply it by three we will have about the price of the cost of the lumber from our Saw Mill, when we calculate all the stealing of the men employed at the"},{"pageid":69393,"pagefilename":"94aeeed2a8428aec5941469144c5680c.jpg","transcription":"mill, the expense of the teams that haul lumber &c.\n\n    There are many other matters connected with the Quartermaster's Department which I cannot but notice, although it may be considered as interfering with what is not my business:\n    A man came here not long since with a team of twelve wagons from the end of the Railroad, he was twenty six [underlined 2 words] days in coming up, and I doubt if he will not be double that time going back.  He stated that he was employed at either $9 or $10 per day for each train and his mules were to be fed by the Quartermaster.

Oregon is generally supposed to be a part of the Indian country named in the act of Congress of June 30, 1834 but Such is not the case.  Great Britian and the United States made a treaty in 1818, by which the Northern boundary of the former was extended west on the 49th parallel of North latitude to the Stony Mountains, and the Territory beyond these was described as country to be held in the joint occupation of the two powers.  The Rocky Mountains then was the Western Boundary of the United States for legislative purposes and so continued until 1840.  The act of 1834, shows in terms that it was intended for a country over which the general Government had absolute and exclusive jurisdiction, Congress by express enactments in 1850, extended said act to this Territory for the reason as must be supposed that it was not in force here before that time.  The act of 1834 then, has no vitality here because Oregon is Indian Country, but by virtue of the act of 1850, which gives it effect here so far as its provisions may be applicable, is that provision prohibiting the sale of liquor to the Indian applicable very much of the act of 1834, is [strike] is clearly unsuited to the present condition of the country, all those provisions which tend to prevent emigration, the free occupation"},{"pageid":69424,"pagefilename":"fb0b4658cc5afb6e3701c6bda9c94509.jpg","transcription":"and use of the country by whites, must be considered repealed, whatever militates against the true interest of a white population is inapplicable.  References can be made to no law which in express words or by implication repeals the provisions in question, and no good reason can be assigned why it should not be held applicable to our condition.  If required in a country wholly inhabited by Indians, how much greater the necessity for its enforcement here, where defenceless white persons, women and children, are exposed to the violence of drunken Savages.  Selling liquor to Indians is not necessary to the welfare or prosperity of the people here, on the contrary such a prohibition is a blessing to the Indians, and highly promotive of the safety, peace and good order of the white community.\n\n                             __________________Motion overruled ____________________\n\nSalem: December 7th 1853"},{"pageid":69425,"pagefilename":"a323884b7a0507f7e84f8a7a0c1e1a31.jpg","transcription":"Copy\nOleny Justice_____  I concur with the Cheif Justice that no part of Oregon is Indian Country as defined by the act of 1834, and that none of the provisions of that act were put in force here by the law establishing Territorial Government.  It was a local Statute, and no more extended here by the last clause of Section 14, of our Organic act, than are the local laws of the District of Columbia.  That clause extended over us the general laws of the united States, under which we possessed the right to import and sell to all classes of customers goods of every description, spirits and wines included.  I arrive at the same conclusion with the Cheif Justice that up to June 5, 1850, there were no restrictions or regulations (touching the sale of Spirits or other commodities to Indians) on that day Congress enacted \"That the law regulating trade and intercourse with the Indians [strike s] tribes east of the Rocky Mountains, or such provisions of the same as may be applicable, be extended over the Indian tribes in the Territory of Oregon\" ---- the law refered to is the act of 1834.  By omitting to declare which of its provisions if any, are applicable; Congress has devolved this task upon the Courts, no rule being given by which to determine which are, and which are not applicable, our first and perhaps most difficult duty, is to fix upon Such a rule.

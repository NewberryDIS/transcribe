He then repeated a form of thanksgiving and prayer, handed down from generation to generation.  This form was not to be altered or laid aside.

They ate only once in twenty four hours, a little after dark.  The hunters also in the chief town commenced hunting at the same time.  The first buck shot, was for sacrifice.  The chief hunter, without touching this buck in any other pace, took hold of his tongue, - cut off a piece from the end of the right side, - wrapped it in old leaves of the last year, and put it up for sacrifice.

Third, the washings, introduced here properly belong to the latter feast.  \nThere was another method of celebrating the feast of first fruits, more modern than either of the foregoing and yet more ancient than the present.

As this moon appeared when the leaves began to turn yellow and fall, it may be considered as the October new moon, including the latter part of september and the forpart of October.  This they call their great new moon, not only because the earth was created that season of the year, so that it was actually the first new moon, and thus literally began the year, but also because they commenced their year with this new moon, as far as the new moons, and new moon feasts were concerned.  \nThe seven prime counsellors, who ordered all the national feasts, were very particular in determining the time when this new moon would appear.  They counted the nights from the new moon before, and also watched the waning of the old moon.  But in case the moon could not be seen, and some doubt remained, as to the time of its appearance, the priest consulted his Divining stone to determine the point.\nHaving ascertained the time when the new moon would appear, the seven counsellors made arrangements for the feast.  Seven nights previous, they called an assembly at the council house.  They then directed all the hunters in the town to devote the six intervening days to hunting.  They also appointed six honorable women to cook, and prepare victuals, and seven men to prepare tables, & order the feast.  \nThe day the new moon was to appear, the hunters returned with their meat barbicued, and deposited it in the storehouse.

In all cases the tongue must be sacrificed before the priest could taste of the meat of the buck from which it was taken.  \nOn this evening also the whole nation assembled  Each family brought seven or more ears of corn, a parcel of beans, dried pumpkin and some of every kind of produce they had raised, and delivered to the priest for his support, or rather it was said, to feed his friends, who should from time to time call on him.  Each family also brought some of all their produce for the priest and deposited it in the storehouse.  This night none but infants might sleep.  The women devoted a part of the night to a religious dance.  \nEarly the next morning, before sunrise, all were ordered to the river.  While on the bank, the priest prayed and went through certain ceremonies (as in more modern times) and then ordered all to wash.  This they did as usual, by wading in and plunging entirely seven times.  They had their clothes on.  Infants and children were all plunged seven times.  \nOn coming out of the water, each passed by a stool, on which the priest had placed his Divining stone, and as they passed held the palm of the hand toward the stone and looked into it.  Now those who were to live till the first spring new moon, could see themselves, it is said standing erect in the stone; but such as were to die before that time, would see themselves lying down in the stone.  These went one side by themselves.  \nThe company then dispersed to various houses in the town and changed their wet clothes for such as were clean and dry, and then repaired again to the council house.  \nThe great men bathed after the common people had left the river, in the same manner the others had done.\nThe victuals having been prepared, was placed in order, as at the feast of green fruits, and all ate about 9 o'clock as at the other feasts."},{"pageid":70574,"pagefilename":"16bfc221e40ad05b8a6a750f5296123c.jpg","transcription":"319 penciled at top of page - also number 23\nSuch, however, as, according to the oracle, were to die before the first spring new moon, fasted all this day.

He then spread the cloth one of them had given him, - set the divining stone upon it, and prayed for instruction relative to this man's life.  The man then holding the palm of his right hand toward the stone, looked into it.  Now if his life was good, he saw himself erect, in his natural colour; but if not, his form, either appeared, and immediately vanished, or appeared in the reclining posture, or with a blue countenance.  In this case, his cause was referred to the next new moon, in four weeks, and if the omens were then had, he was soon to die.  But if, on this second trial, any one appeared erect and natural, he was ordered to go to the river, and plunge seven times, with his head toward the east.\nOn this night also none but infants might sleep.

The signification of this word, is not easily ascertained.  It implies that communion the Indians enter into on certain occasions.  Thus, when two young men conceived a peculiar fondness for each other, they entered into a state of perpetual brotherhood, if I may so call this relation, which cannot be expressed by any word in our language.  They put on their best clothing, and met by mutual agreement, at a time & place appointed.  Without much conversation, one took off a certain garment and gave to his friend.  In this he was immediately imitated by the other.  Another garment was then exchanged, and another, until there was an entire inter change of clothing.  Thus each one gave himself to the other and was clothed by the other, & were of course one.  This relation embraced all that is implied in peace, reconciliation, friendship, and brotherhood, and much more than either or all of those terms.  When two were thus giving themselves to each other, and entering into that closest connexion, it was said of them A na to no ka, and the relation thus formed was termed A to hu no.  So the feast under consideration was termed A to hu no and may we not suppose that this word, whatever its precise meaning may be, is designed to express an idea something similar to expiation, reconciliation or atonement.  When the two parties concerned, vir. God and his people, become reconciled, and mutually, through the infinite, condescension of God, give themselves to each other, and become one (in Christ)\nThe nature and design of this feast may also be inferred from the name given the great priest at the time, or which"},{"pageid":70576,"pagefilename":"701905a4245e248c29f65720799c22b0.jpg","transcription":"322 penciled at top of page - also 26\nofficiating, vis.

Soon after the people had retired from that feast, the seven prime counsellors, (i.e. the seven counsellors of the great priest above mentioned) convened an assembly at the council house.

Having coals placed one side of the pot, on the altar, he stood west of the fire, with his face towards it, and of course towards the east, his right hand man stood by his side, and his seven counsellors in the semicircle behind them.  The priest then held up the deer's tongue between the thumb and finger of his right hand, and prayed.  He then put the deer's tongue on the coals, and sprinkled on old tobacco.  His right hand man and seven counsellors united with him in watching the meat.  As many times as the meat popped, so many deaths would occur during the year.  In case there was to be much sickness among the people, the smoke of the sacrifice would form a bluish cloud over the fire, and not rise directly; otherwise, it would ascend immediately toward heaven.  The priest also consulted his U lu sa ta, or Divining stone.  The hunters, as they came in from hunting gave him the skin of a buck, of a doe and of a fawn.  These he spread west of the fire with the heads towards it, and of course towards the east, having the flesh side up.  He then took a little bunch of weeds, and dipped it in fresh blood, either of a deer, or of fowls, and drew a streak of blood on the skins from the head to the tail.  On this streak of blood on the buck skin, he set his U lu sa ta, in the middle of the skin.  He also placed on the same skin seven strands of beads one for each clan.  Now when they came to examine the Divining stone, if it was to be sickly, it would assume a bluish, smoky appearance, but if not it would exhibit a bright, dazzling appearance, without smoke.  The priest also enquired by the beads.  This, however, is probably of modern origin.

Thus he proceeded to enquire with the seven strands of beads.  \nThe most ancient method of divining at this seems to have been the following.  The priest folded seven deer skins, and placed them on a stool, and sat his U lu sa ta on them, and prayed.  Now if it was to be healthy, a bright blaze, without smoke appeared in the stone.  But if the year was to be sickly, a smoky appearance would be observed in it, and just as many as were to die with the sickness appeared in the right side of it.\nNutrawi\nThe meat which had been distributed before noon, had been cooked, and was now called for by the great speaker.

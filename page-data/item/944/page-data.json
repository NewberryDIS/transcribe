This cow-plough, though evidently superior to any contrivance for picking up or catching the cow, does not always do it's work.  Not far from the town of Jackson, we came up with one of these poor animals that happened to be lying on the rails.  On this occasion the plough went over it, & so did the first two or three carriages; til at last the unhappy brute got fast fixed among the springs & wheels of the car I was in.  The train was stopped & the cow taken out, which though horribly mangled, proved to be still alive.  The conductor called out for the loan of a pistol to enable him to put it out of its misery.  In an instant, almost from every window on that side the train a hand was extended offering the desired instrument.

It seems a greater invasion than that of the Roman Empire by their Fathers.  That overthrew the Empire, & for a time disorganized society, however it did not extend the language of the Fatherland into Italy, Spain, or France.  But here is a continuous stream of between 200,000 & 300,000 every year, coming, not with sword & torch, to slay & to burn, or to perish themselves, but with the ax & the plough, to clear away the forest, & to cultivate the soil.

It gives them a dignity & a bearing they wd not otherwise possess.

These are good effects which the American system has upon those also who are most humbly placed.

A prayer was then offered, but as a preliminary to it the subjects it was proposed to make mention of in the prayer were announced with a few brief & pointed comments.

There seemed a great deal more smoke than flames, which streamed off down the wind like large bodies of cloud.

The Prairie was once covered with trees, because when fire is kept off by cultivations, & the earth loosened by the plough, so as to admit light & air to a greater depth than before, young trees at once appear.  Of course the parent trees must at some time or other have grown on the spot.  unclear the seeds that were sufficiently near the undisturbed surface to germinate, had germinated, & the young plants that issued from them had been destroyed by fire.

Payne   Charleston S.C. \nalong top right of page Carried  Dec. 15 1834 \nDear Sir\nYesterday I had the pleasure of receiving yours of the 8th unclear- Inst. and should rejoice to comply fully with your request, were it in my power but my information relative to Indian antiquities is not sufficient to justify me in attempting to give any thing like a connected view of them. And though I have written many things from the lips of the old men which were to me interesting, yet these sketches are imperfect and detached, and could not, without some time, be prepared for inspection. The most therefore that I can do at the present is to furnish you with a few unclear lines of the antiquities of the Cherokees. \nThey consider themselves, and the other Indians in North America as the real, or peculiar people, and the people especially beloved of God. \nThey say they came from beyond the sea; but concerning their history previous to their coming to this continent I have obtained no information, except they say their fathers had sacred fire which God handed down to them from above. \nThey speak of passing through a wilderness long ago, when they carried a certain building which they set up whenever they halted, and in, or about which, the priests sat. (on this continent.) \nThey say they kept their holy fire till their enemies came upon them, destroyed their building in which it was kept,  symbol for \"and\" drove them away. After this, to supply the place of the holy fire, they made new fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together till they took fire. This new fire they used in their hunting, and war expeditions, and on some other occasions. \nNew Cherokees appear to have commenced their year with the blooming of peach trees, or about that time, that is, in March; yet their annual New moons commenced with the new moon in September. The Inuks, however, in order to unite all their religious festivals in one, make their newmoons commence with the feast of first fruits."},{"pageid":70399,"pagefilename":"07fedc1fbae9a5ef392e86628fb40e27.jpg","transcription":"The ancient government of the Cherokees was a"},{"pageid":70400,"pagefilename":"6b28986ed00d4524eb8c7cf4047cfd59.jpg","transcription":"The Cherokees are divided into seven families, or clans. This I believe is the case with the other tribes also. The individuals in these families were supposed to be too nearly related to admit of intermarriages, and therefore such marriages were punished with death. All the members of one family, i.e. one clan, associated together as parents and children, or as brother & sister, or near relatives.\nThomas Smith\nIt is said that anciently young people could not marry without the consent of the parents of both parties, and also the approbation of the priest who was to officiate. They were married for life. The marriage of a priest was attended with peculiar ceremonies. His wife must be a person approved by his seven counsellors, she must be a virgin, who had never had a husband, and of unblemished character. Great honour was attached to her character, and in some respects she filled the place of her husband on his disease, till the consecration of his successor, though, in that case, his official duties, generally, were performed by his right hand man.\n[Unclear]\n[T.?] Smith\nOn the death of the high priest, his assistant, or right hand man, appointed the time for the consecration of his successor, and dispatched his messenger to notify the priest through the nation, giving him a string of wild [hemp?] braided, and having as many knots tied in it as there were nights previous to the meeting. This messenger went personally to all the towns lying in a direct [unclear], leaving other towns to be notified at his request. [Unclear] cut a knot from his string every morning, till the priests being assembled at the time appointed, sent each his messenger to the candidate for office, requesting him to accept the appointment, supposing he would need encouragement and persuasion to bring him forward. [On?] the return of this messengers, and being assured [of?] the willingness of the candidate to comply with this request, the priests all [repaired?] in due order to his house. I have not understood whether -- crossed out the candidate was washed, [[but this was probably the case, as it is said -- crossed out] there must not be the [last?] filth about about him, when his official robe was put on him. Seeing that his body was pure from all filth, the priests dressed him in the garments peculiar to his office. These consecration garments were were made in the same fashion"},{"pageid":70401,"pagefilename":"1595f53f8d25f79c2fe132106130cd51.jpg","transcription":"6/9 with those constituting his white dress, only these were of deer skin painted yellow. The cap was like the white cap only painted yellow; and ornamented with feathers painted yellow. The assistant principal priest then took the candidate and carried him to the council house, being perceived by half the company, singing as they went and followed by the other half; and halting three times on the way. On arriving at the council house, the assist-ant first first seated the candidate on the middle white seat, which the other priests seated themselves in due order, on white seats in the form of a semicircle, the most distinguished sitting nearest the candidate. The assistant principal priest then took an ointment made of chalk (or white clay) and deer's tallow, on the forefinger of his right hand, and approaching the candidate, and putting his finger on his head, drew it down over his forehead, nose and chin to his breast, making a white mark. He then drew it from the top of his head to his back then putting his finger (with the ointment) on the theessed [?]nail of his right hand, drew it up his arm to his shoulder, and from there to his breast touching the end of the first mark, and then down his leg to the great toe nail of his right foot.The other ceremonie prayers he [??] omit.\nWhen any other priest, counsellor or messenger died, the high priest took measures to have his successor consecrated in due form. Thomas Smith [underlined, out of line]\nI have said above that the initiating dress of the high priest resembled his white dress generally except in colour. The high priest, (as well as all the other priests,) had a white dress in which he gen-erally officiated. It was made of deer skin, and chalked or otherwise made as perfectly white as possible. The shirt came down about half way of the thigh. The breeches were made as follows [vir?]. There were two aprons one before + one behind fastened above the hips with a girdle, and extending down about half way to the knees. These aprons were fastened together at each side, and the middle drawn up between their legs, so as to answer all the purposes of short breeches.

But sometimes they let it hang down, They generally had the rim of their ears bow and strung with jewels. \n2. Ornaments for the neck, the men wore a band of panther's skin, with the hair on, and having small bells fastened to it. They had also strings put over their necks, to which were attached various ornaments, exchanged in later years for round pieces of silver like a full moon, or semicircular pieces like a new moon. These hung down to the breast. \nThe women had beads made of horn or turkey bond, seriously wrought, and strung on a long thread, so as to go many times round the neck, each folding hanging to er then the other, in such a manner that the breast was frequently nearly covered with beads. \n3. Dress for the body. The men wore a leather shirt, with sleeves coming down to the hips. Their breeches were like those of the priests, only made of deer skin dressed in the usual way, their coats came down about to the knees. Their blankets were of leather, a belted round them. \nThe women wore a short gown, of deerskin, fastened in the bosom with sashes or broaches, made of bone. They had also a certain kind of handkerchief, to which was fastened a small bell, in such a manner as to hand down in the bosom. \n4. Dress + ornaments for the arms legs and feet.

After this, all who retain the position in the army were supposed to be bold,  unclear, and efficient warriors, and therefore they generallly engaged with great confidence and fierceness in the fight. During the contest, the priest stood back unless he saw some of the warriors giving back, and in that case, he went forward with great fury, and either conquered or died. \nThe confict being ended, they set their faces towards home, but not hastily, or disorderly. before arriving at the town from whence they started, a messenger was sent forward to give notice of their approach, and of their intention to be at a certain place at a given time. To that place, therefore, the people repeaired at the specified time. As the warriors approached, two men, followed by the women, advanced toward them commencing a hymn, or song, in honour of their valiant & warlike deeds. But though the two men commenced this song, yet the women immediately caught it, and went forward? shouting the praises of the warriors. Each warrior delivered his spoil to his wife, or nearest female relative, who took it home, while the warriors continued their march to the council house. There they were met by the resident priests and the people to express their joy in a dance, which continued during the night. After this was over, and the soldiers had returned home, they could  unclear with their wives as usual, but not before. Therefore no female prisoners are ever defiled by Indian warriors. The priest for the wars had a peculiar dress. His cape was red, as was also his seat in council. Silversmith Hottle? What musical instruments were used in war (if any) I have not understood. It is said that the priests anciently had trumpets made of long necked gourds, for their own use exclusively. The people used at dances, a kettle drum and a pipe, made of cane, three or four inches long. They had also a flute made of cane, perhaps  unclear long, blown, as the pipe, at the end.\nDear Sir, I would now gladly proceed to give you some account of the feast of first fruits and other religious festivals, but in that case, the mail would pass, & I fear, I could have no opportunity to forward my communication in time to meet you in Charleston.

And though I have written many things from the lips of the old men which were to me interesting, yet these sketches are imperfect and detached, and could not, without some time, be prepared for inspection. The most therefore that I can do at the present is to furnish you with a few unclear lines of the antiquities of the Cherokees. \nThey consider themselves, and the other Indians in North America as the real, or peculiar people, and the people especially beloved of God. \nThey say they came from beyond the sea; but concerning their history previous to their coming to this continent I have obtained no information, except they say their fathers had sacred fire which God handed down to them from above. \nThey speak of passing through a wilderness long ago, when they carried a certain building which they set up whenever they halted, and in, or about which, the priests sat. (on this continent.) \nThey say they kept their holy fire till their enemies came upon them, destroyed their building in which it was kept,  symbol for \"and\" drove them away. After this, to supply the place of the holy fire, they made new fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together till they took fire. This new fire they used in their hunting, and war expeditions, and on some other occasions. \nNew Cherokees appear to have commenced their year with the blooming of peach trees, or about that time, that is, in March; yet their annual New moons commenced with the new moon in September. The Inuks, however, in order to unite all their religious festivals in one, make their newmoons commence with the feast of first fruits."},{"pageid":70399,"pagefilename":"07fedc1fbae9a5ef392e86628fb40e27.jpg","transcription":"The ancient government of the Cherokees was a"},{"pageid":70400,"pagefilename":"6b28986ed00d4524eb8c7cf4047cfd59.jpg","transcription":"The Cherokees are divided into seven families, or clans. This I believe is the case with the other tribes also. The individuals in these families were supposed to be too nearly related to admit of intermarriages, and therefore such marriages were punished with death. All the members of one family, i.e. one clan, associated together as parents and children, or as brother & sister, or near relatives.\nThomas Smith\nIt is said that anciently young people could not marry without the consent of the parents of both parties, and also the approbation of the priest who was to officiate. They were married for life. The marriage of a priest was attended with peculiar ceremonies. His wife must be a person approved by his seven counsellors, she must be a virgin, who had never had a husband, and of unblemished character. Great honour was attached to her character, and in some respects she filled the place of her husband on his disease, till the consecration of his successor, though, in that case, his official duties, generally, were performed by his right hand man.\n[Unclear]\n[T.?] Smith\nOn the death of the high priest, his assistant, or right hand man, appointed the time for the consecration of his successor, and dispatched his messenger to notify the priest through the nation, giving him a string of wild [hemp?] braided, and having as many knots tied in it as there were nights previous to the meeting. This messenger went personally to all the towns lying in a direct [unclear], leaving other towns to be notified at his request.

On arriving at the council house, the assist-ant first first seated the candidate on the middle white seat, which the other priests seated themselves in due order, on white seats in the form of a semicircle, the most distinguished sitting nearest the candidate. The assistant principal priest then took an ointment made of chalk (or white clay) and deer's tallow, on the forefinger of his right hand, and approaching the candidate, and putting his finger on his head, drew it down over his forehead, nose and chin to his breast, making a white mark.

The old? Cherokees taught that God created man of red earth, and made the woman of one of man's ribs. God soon taught mankind to build high places, on which to erect places of worship, and unclear, and offer sacrifices. There the priests called the people together, and on some occasions continued their preaching the whole day; while the audience? remained perfectly silent. The priest enjoined perfect obedience to God, and forbid all idle & foolish talk, all lewdness, and polygamy. He taught children to be industrious and obedient to their parents. He enjoined obedience to God in secret, as well as in public, because God always saw them & was with them. He also delivered predictions of future events.

God then sent a messenger to a certain man, commanding him to warn the people to turn from their sins, or he would bring a flood to destroy them. This man obeyed, but to no effect. The messenger was sent again & again, but the people would not hear. Then God directed this man to build a house sufficiently large to accommodate his own family, and some of all the different kinds of animals. This being done the animals came to him & he took them in and shut the doors. The rain then commenced and continued forty days and forty nights.

Not long after the flood, the people determined to put up a building which would reach to heaven.

This messenger went personally to all the towns situated in a direct course, and the other towns were notified at his request. He cut a knot from his string every morning, till the priests being assembled at the time appointed, sent their messengers to the candidate, urging him to accept the office, supposing that his modesty would render persuasion necessary in order to bring him forward to so distinguished an office.

During the day they were mostly in a company, unclear or near the townhouse watching each other to see that no one violated the rules of the play. These rules were as follows. 1. No one of the players must go near his wife, or any other woman during the seven days of the dance, nor for four days after the play. Some were scratched, the better to fit them for the play. These must not associate with their wives for twenty four days after being scratched. 2. They must eat no meat, nor any thing hot or salt.

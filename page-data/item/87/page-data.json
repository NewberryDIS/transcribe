As we neared Church St. (where we board) we passed a decrepit old negro leaning on two crutches and helping himself along as best he could. \"See that poor old man,\" said I. \"He's given the strength of his years to the white folks\" was Miss Jencks answer. I wanted to follow him to his home and see if he was comfortable there, but thought perhaps I could do nothing to make him more so, if he wasn't. So I hesitated till it was too late, and then was sorry I hadn't.\nYou ask about my room it is not in the garret though I suppose in the proper place for it and is up three flights of stairs, pretty long ones, so we try to save ourselves a frequent ascent.

The house is a large square brown brick building with about 6 ft. of ground, brick laid, between us and the St. shut in by a neat brown picket fence, which curves to meet the house on each side of the front door giving open sesame to the passersby. We usually enter by a side gate along a passage also brick laid by the side of the house through a back entry which has one door leading into the front hall, one into the dining room, and from the opposite side one into the kitchen. The floor of this entrance way is brick so is the back yd. in about the middle of which is the pump of the cistern.

Thank you much for your letter which I received last Saturday night.  It was dated Oct 27.  I think we can appreciate, in a measure your letters.  They are more than common messages of love, for they are written in sickness, in weakness, when the use of the pen must cause some exertion -- We have reason to thank the Lord, that though he has brought you so low in weak and apparently so near the brink of the \"dark river\" he has yet spared your lives.  And he will, I trust strengthen you and once more, let you bathe in the river of health.  Dear ones all, how often the wish comes to us, that we could be with you and could comfort you and assist you a little -- I hope you have received that box ere this, I suppose Mary will tell you when it was sent.  It will do you no good for me to write surmises of how you are, and what you are doing, for you already know all about that.  But you have, I suppose no Oracle, who tells you how your home friends are occupied so perhaps a little news of them would be as acceptable as any thing I could write.  I say home friends which seems most like home to you, Remsen, or Kansas?  The Mountain Parsonage or your \"Snug House\"?  The \"home is where the heart is.\"  And though perhaps you each have your dearest friend by your side,sharing in  all your troubles, still do not your thoughts sometimes travel here?  Are not your hears or the love of your hearts often with us?  Why what is the matter with me?  I am asking you questions, instead of telling you of us.  Well, we often let our thoughts travel to you and sometimes suffer our imagination to picture your forms and home but we do not like to have it bring your sufferings before our eyes.

We hear frequently from Jennie and occasionly from Elisabeth.  They both seem to be well and happy, and anxiously inquiring for you.  Jennie says she has written to you twice and hopes to get  her reward sometime.  I do not know as she said she had written to you Sarah, but to one or both of you I guess.

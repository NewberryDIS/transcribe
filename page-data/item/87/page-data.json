They are more than common messages of love, for they are written in sickness, in weakness, when the use of the pen must cause some exertion -- We have reason to thank the Lord, that though he has brought you so low in weak and apparently so near the brink of the \"dark river\" he has yet spared your lives.

It will do you no good for me to write surmises up how you are, and what you are doing, for you already know all about that.  But you have, I suppose no Oracle, who tells you how your home friends are occupied so perhaps a little more of them would be as acceptable as any thing I could write.

Well, we often let our thoughts travel to you and sometimes suffer our imagination to picture your forms and home but we do not like to have it bring your sufferings before our eyes.

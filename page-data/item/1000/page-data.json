In fact few, if any, depredations have been committed since the successful campaign against Victoria's Band, that can with certainty be traced to Indians and in case they should again make their appearance, in this section of the country, which is hardly probable, the citizens are sufficiently numerous and strong enough to quickly destroy or drive them out of the state.\n\n  This post, it is presumed, is at present occupied mainly for the reason that it affords shelter for troops and here they will necessarily have to remain at least until assignment can be made for their location elsewhere.  Still it is evident that the transportation for supplies for so large a garrison, as is now held here, has become a useless and unprofitable expenditure of public money, and also it is true that Concho like other posts surrounded by a numerous population affords means which go to the support of some worthy people, yet it is a fact that it mainly contributes to the profit of a multitude of disreputable persons who pandering to the worst propensities of the soldiers, vulturelike prey upon their earnings almost as a sole means of existence.\n\n  If this post is occupied for any great length of time extensive repairs will necessarily be required.   The money which would be thus expended would, I think, be put to much better use in making the troops comfortable at points where their services are more needed.   If however it has been decided to retain Concho with its present permanent garrison for another year I recommend, after full consideration of the subject that the sub-posts at Grierson's spring and Head of North Concho be retained and occupied at present until say June 1st inst. and that without delay a suitable point near the line of the railroad be selected and occupied by 2 companies (1 of Cavalry and one of Infantry) that when those 2 companies are sufficiently well established that those at the old sub-posts be withdrawn to Concho and the new Sub-post be then increased"},{"pageid":65333,"pagefilename":"87aa63f0cfeba2957accc630b2c0f6b8.jpg","transcription":"by 2 more companies from Concho (1 of Cavalry and 1 of Infantry) and that thereafter as long as Concho remains the permanent station of the 8 companies that they and the 2 Majors now here alternated between this post and the new sub-post.

The entire command could be kept in good condition and by making use of the then surplus material. no longer required here which could be utilized and made available, the troops could be soon comfortably stationed at the new sub-post and all this with proper management accomplished mainly by the labor of the troops and at comparatively little expense or outlay of money.\n\n  There is no suitable place or site immediately in the line of the railroad for such sub-post or station for troops.

From 40 to 50 miles west of Big springs in the vicinity of Odessa, sufficient water can be obtained by digging wells, but the surrounding country is dismal and uninviting.  At the Sand hills water can always be obtained by digging, but otherwise that region is a desert.  The best and only suitable place for a sub-post in that whole section of country is on Deep creek, called by some Calvert's Creek.  that stream affords an abundant supply of water and is alive with perch, bass and blue catfish, there is also plenty of wood and excellent grazing in the immediate vicinity.   This is about 110 miles northwest of this post, and 25 miles above Colorado city on the north side of the Colorado river.  There is a good road from there to Colorado city, over which supplies for the command would be readily hauled from the railroad by post or government transportation.

If this site or any other is selected, I advise that if possible the government get possession of the land without delay or if this is impracticable, I will, if decided best, find some officer or officers to file claims on enough to properly protect the interests of the government.

Col. Leavenworth warned me against going without taking at least two Regiments of Troops and a Battery of Artillery, that if I went with a smaller force I would certainly be killed and my command destroyed, notwithstanding this warning and without waiting for orders I left Ft. Gibson on the first of June with a detachment of ten men, and upon arrival at Ft. Arbuckle,organized a force of about 200 Cavalry and 30 Infantry and proceeded west exploring the country thouroughly beyond the north fork of Red River, passing around the Witchita mountains and returning via Ft. Cobb and the valley in the Washita to Arbuckle, without meeting a hostile Indian and thence to Ft. Gibson in a north easterly direction, without regard to roads, arriving at the latter point on the 13th of July - In my official report of this expedition to Department HdQrs daled July 14 - 1868, I stated the following facts in regard to Indian affairs at that time.\n\"The valley of the Washita river from a point five miles below Ft. Cobb, to some distance this side of the Chickasaw line is a wide and apparently fertile, but has no good water in it, it is in that section that Col. Leavenworth established his agency for the Comanche and Kiowa tribes and Major Shanklin, agent for two affiliated bands, has also gathered his Indians there. The Witchitas, Wacoes, To-woc-caroes, Kee-Chics, Caddos, and Au-a-dagh-cap. Col. Leavenworth's agency seems very injudiciously located in the brush on a hill-side, five miles south of the Washita with not water enough near him for drinking purposes of the people alone and where, if the Indians settle around him as is intended, they must drive their stock five miles to water. This agency too, instead of being west or south-west of the section occupied by the reserve Indians, Witchitas and affiliated bands (namely within the boundaries of  the Kiowa and Comanche reserve,) as defined in the treaty of 1867 is in their midst. Major Shanklin's agency being still farther up to the Washita, I believe that this location of their agency was the first cause of the discontent among Comanches and Kiowas, their want of confidence in their agent Leavenworth and his uncertain, vacillating conduct  towards them, together with the failure on the part of the contractors  to furnish and of the agents to deliver the annuities and the promised supplies, increased the disaffection and finally"},{"pageid":65337,"pagefilename":"bcbbc11b5139265b49b92c4818c23e04.jpg","transcription":"many of them returned to the plains.

The largest band called the Qua-ah-da-de-chatz-ken-ma (antelope eaters or users) have never come into treat for peace, but remain hostile inhabiting the Staked Plain regions and preying upon northern Mexico and Texas. The Fam-pa-ri-kos (Root-diggers) were included in the last treaty but never kept really quiet; from their band marauding parties were often sent to Texas and children as well as horses brought back. They were encamped around Col. Leavenworth for a time and soon discovered that while they remained quiet, they got very little, but by intimidating the vulnerable agent, they could obtain abundant supplies. Upon this principle they acted until the subsistence stores gave out, then after an unusual demonstration, in which no one was hurt - , however, they also moved north and are with or near the Kiowas.

The same Indians complain that the agents neglect them and give the main portion of the presents and supplies to the less worthy, faithless bands, and I am satisfied that such is the facts.\nBefore reaching Ft. Arbuckle I had met the agents Col Leavenworth and Major Shanklin and special Subsistence agent Caldwell, En- route to Ft. Cobb and while in that neighborhood I met all the traders, interpreters and other whiles living there and the chiefs of all the tribes remaining in that section. I conversed at length with all and altho' it was impossible to whether positive proof of special improper acts on the part of the Indian agents the information I received from all parties left no doubt in my mind that Col Leavenworth encouraged the wilder Indians in their maraudings by secretly giving large presents to obtain the captive children whom he nominally demanded, and by increasing the supplies whenever they threatened him or his goods. He also, as has already been reported by Captain Walsh sent to Ft. Arbuckle in great haste for troops to protect him and when asked by the Indians, why the troops were there, he disclaimed all knowledge of the cause.\nI believe that the Witchitas, Wakoes, Caddos, Peneteghkas, Comanches,&c who really deserve credit and encouragement for remaining faithful and endeavoring to become gradually self-sustaining by raising corn and stock, have been constantly neglected, their goods and supplies given to the wild tribes.  All the chiefs met me in an apparently friendly spirit, expressed a universal desire for peace and seemed to think that there would be no trouble if their people regularly received their annuities and supplies which the government by its treaties with them is pledged to deliver.\nIn August I was obliged to apply for a leave of absence on account of serious illness in my family whom I took north leaving Ft.

Scott to Ft. Riley, bearing east to avoid the Salt Plains and cross the Arkansas near the mouth of the Little Arkansas.  It might be necessary on account of the length of the route, and to look out for the Indians in the neighborhood of the Salt Plains to have a post in the Territory, near the southern line of Kansas.\n\n   I found that Generals Sheridan and Hazen agreed with me as to the expediency of such a route and proposed soon to open it from Ft. Harker for the transportation of both Army and Indian supplies.  The only protection needed on this route, will be the Post which will have to be established on the Cheyenne and Arapahoe reserve.  My reasons for believing the location described to be the best for a military Post being thus fully given.  I gave them what seemed to me to be equally good reasons for erecting the Agency and locating the Comanches, Kiowas and Apaches to the same vicinity.  I called their attention to the fact that the treaty made with those tribes (every portion of which relating to the obligations of the Government, should be strictly adhered to, if the Indians are held to the same) - expressly provides that the necessary buildings for a permanent agent for them shall be as near as possible to the Geographical centre of the reservation, being convenient to wood and water.   The point I recommended was as near the centre of said reserve, had near it the best wood, water and arable land in that reserve and is in every way adapted to the wants of the agents and of the Indians themselves.   \n\n[following paragraph circled and \"Omit\" written in margin:]   It appeared to me that to locate the agency here, gather the Indians around it, place a force of Cavalry at a military post established near the agency to be used for military purposes alone it would be difficult for a marauding party to reach the boundaries of their reserve without being overtaken by troops, properly handled.  On the other hand no point in the Washita valley can be selected which has either good water or grass and which is not at the extreme northern boundary of the reservation.  By some it was thought that the Mountain region, would be a locality tending to facilitate raids into Texas, by the Indians placed there, but to me it seemed that the very establishment of their families so far south should prevent the Indians from endangering them by expeditions to Texas.  I thought that there would be more ground to fear that trouble would arise through the union of the Indians of the Cheyenne &  Arapahoe reserve with those of the  Comanche & Kiowa reserve than from any other source and I judge the true policy to be to keep the two well separate, rather than by inviting and encouraging the latter to cross their northern boundary which would practically be done by the establishment of their agency upon the Washita."},{"pageid":65343,"pagefilename":"2d5dd84a47e2886e7443840300a5c4b4.jpg","transcription":"\"nor like the Brazos country where we used to live,\n\"the grass is not good here and the water is not good,\n\"we would like to live around the mountains, one days\n\"ride to the south from here.

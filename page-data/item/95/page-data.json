Having no agents of any kind, and depending entirely on our Floral Guide to introduce our goods, all our business is done by correspondence, directly with our customers, and feeling confident that you will again trust us with your order, we hand you herewith an Order Sheet and Envelope addressed, which please place inside the Floral Guide till required, if not ready to forward your order to-day.\nYou will notice that bound with the Floral Guide is the January number of Vick's Illustrated Monthly Magazine. This is sent as a sample copy, hoping that you may see something in this number that will induce you to send us an invitation for the Magazine to make you a monthly visit. It is intended to be a guide and assistant to those engaged in Floriculture, Horticulture and Agriculture; each number contains 32 pages of reading matter, profusely illustrated, and a colored plate of flowers. These plates are often used as studies by artists and amateurs. The subscription price is only $1.25 per year, and each subscriber is presented with a beautiful colored plate of Roses and Pansies, 11 1-2x14 1-2 inches, and every person sending us a club of 4 names for the Magazine with $5.00, will receive an elegant Portfolio of Rare and Beautiful Flowers. Illustrations and full descriptions of these plates can be seen in the January Magazine.\nHoping we may be favored with your orders for Flowers and Vegetable Seeds, Plants, Bulbs, Potatoes, &c., &c. and awaiting your kind commands,\nWe remain,\nYours, &c.,\nJames Vick Sudsman."},{"pageid":24196,"pagefilename":"68bbf49310362096b63ff5a9860b6819.jpg","transcription":"Anna L.

The Winter and previous Spring month had been of the harshest and most inclement weather, that we had been compelled to endure for many years; but on that day it seemed as if nature had exhausted her resources to contribute towards making all lovely, and smiling: for the sky was the color of the most beautiful cerulean blue, the sun darted forth his brightest rays, and the balmy Spring zephyrs, reminding one of the air of the southern climes, came floating along doubly dear to us all on account of being such a contrast, to what we had suffered, from our previous cold, wet, and gloomy season.

After satisfying ourselves with a fine breakfast, we sauntered out to view the Falls, and its surroundings: the Captain had been there before, but to me it was entirely new and Oh! what a treat nature had in store for me, as she poured that vast and wonderful mass of water, out of her bountiful lap; it almost stunned my eyes.

The parade ground was beautifully laid out also the grounds of the Arsenal of the fort. Speaking of the Arsenal recalls to my mind a tradegy which took place on its grounds, it was as follows: The Officer in command of the Arsenal had occasion to punish a soldier: the man swore vengeance, but no significance was attached to what he said, the soldier was afterwards discharged from the United States service.

My husband during his march met a boy about ten years of age, who was endeavoring to wend his way to some near settlement, for protection. The following detail was his sad story; his father had emigrated from the West; he had managed through hard labor to build a log house for himself and family, and surround himself with a few necessaries for tilling the land: the family consisted of father, mother, two sons, and an infant. While engaged in sweet conversation one morning after breakfast, the forms of several Indians darkened their door: the family saw at a glance that the savages were in their war paint; but these white people knew that the only discreet way to act was to conceal their fears, though from the first entrance of the Red Skins, they had not the slighest hope for their lives.

Having sojourned there for about three days we again took up our line of march for our camp on the prairies; this time our style of travelling was rather slower than by railroad as we were compelled to make use of an ambulance drawn by four mules. It was quite comfortable and the average distance of the journey that we travelled was about twenty miles in a day. After the first day out we found ourselves afloat on the wide prairies of Kansas. On the first night was discovered quite a comfortable place for us to take quarters in, and we came across a good sized store which supplied the new settlers for many miles in all directions, with a great deal of the requirements for living in a little comfort, and at that place I purchased tin candlesticks, coffee-pot and a number of small articles which"},{"pageid":56613,"pagefilename":"49efab9ad4e9583af79cbf4557620755.jpg","transcription":"14\nwere stern necessities in camp-life: I was not posted, but the Captain had been there before and as a matter of course I submitted to his judgement.

I was told by the scout that I was the first white lady who had traveled, over that part of the Plains which is a name for the Prairies of Kansas: so the scout thought he would compliment me; and he named one of the hightest mounds or small mountains after me.  This little camp before my arrival at it, had been garrisoned by two companies of soldiers: the one of Captain Van De Wieles was a company of cavalry and the other of Major Parker's was a company of Infantry, and the Major of this Infantry being higher in rank than my husband, was on that account called the commanding officer.

One tent was used by us as a sleeping apartment and the other as an office and sitting room: we also had a board floor which was quite a luxury for campaigners; our mess or eating arrangement was happily managed, as we all took our meals together; the all consisted of Captain V. myself, Major Parker, Lieutenant Umbstater, and an army surgeon,"},{"pageid":56617,"pagefilename":"2abe85f01049cc816a55ff11f8e19d74.jpg","transcription":"18\nYes! there were four officers and I was the only lady, so I received a great deal of attention, as they considered that I was very brave, to come out to such a dangerous place, and I can assure you that they fully appreciated my courage, not knowing but that the camp might be attacked by Indians at any time as such afterwards proved to be the case.

About two and a half miles from the Fort in one direction was a place called Junction City, where considerable business was carried on; a bank was there and all kinds of stores; and about five mules in another direction, was the small town of Ogden, and there the Army Officers found to their delight was  a large brewery where they could buy good fresh lager beer. The officers and their wives were constantly in the habit of making horse-back excursions to over or other of these places and they enjoyed these excursions very much, as it afforded them a very pleasant pastime; as well as a healthy exercise."},{"pageid":56627,"pagefilename":"4c408afa1ed3bd655831a890f05c55f8.jpg","transcription":"28\nOn one particular occassion a large party consisting of Major Van De Wiele, myself, also Doctor George M.

This tribe was peaceful and party civilized; but still they thought of \"Old Lang Syne\" and then practiced for amusement what in their early days was stern reality. Well! they were all painted in their hideous war style: they made themselves look perfectly fiendish, with their red, yellow and black streaks drawn across their faces. A large fire was kindled, and while it was in full blaze, the half civilized Red Men commenced their war dance. The old squaws with their round wooden frames covered with the skins of some animals, began a monotonous drawl of y-a-w, y-a-w, which together with the noise  they made on their tom-tom which was the name they gave to their rough drums, composed the music for their dancing.

Major Van De Wiele's troop of cavalry was stationed about a quarter of a mile from the town of Sheridan, in order to protect the people in it from the raids of the Indians; and on account of the rough class of the people, there was constant firing of guns, and pistols, quarreling, and fighting, going on both by day and night.

I also had with me a most beautiful youn shepherd dog as frolicksome as a kitten, and one peculiarity my dog Prince had, was to walk into my tent early in the morning; pull my shoes and stockings off the chairs, and carry them to different parts of the camp, where they would be found and brought back by the soldiers.

Our camp was broken up and we went with the troop, to a camp where several other companies were being massed together for a general scouting expedition: at this camp the land was very similar to that camp which we had left; it was quite barren as the trees were all at the borders of the streams and there I remained for two days; and then the troops proceeded on their way.  Major Van De Wilele with an escort took me to a camp near to Fort Wallace, where another officer and his wife were stationed and I was forced again to be left alone with my servant as the Major had to rejoin his company.

They came straggling along, spread out over the land, like the tail of a peacock; the women called squaws who attended to all drudgery, were taking care of the children called papooses and also tending to the ponies, which were carrying their household goods, and the skins of animals which were used to cover their lodges besides the poles upon which these tepees were constructed: Their style of wagons were long poles fasten each side of a pony with some sort of foundation upon which they would lay all their worldly possessions: and while one end of the pole was fastened to the pony, the other end was trailing on the ground.

Little Raven who was the head Chief was very obese in condition, and he really was so fat that he looked as broad as he was long; but he was also smiling and social. I however felt some timidity at such an overwhelming number of Red Skins, and a guard was placed around my ambulance to prevent these noble red men from rushing up and being too profuse with their civilities, and they were so filthy, and dirty, that they certainly looked better, when viewed from a distance. Every thing however passed off pleasantly and peacefully; and after a journey of twelve days, over a beautiful country, we reached Fort Sill; and upon our arrival at that place, we received a most kind and hearty welcome. This place had not yet assumed the conditions of a regular fort, although there were quite a number of companies of Cavalry and Infantry there: the habitations were a line of houses or rather rooms, put up by the men of each officer's company or troop as one choses to term it: the outside material was logs, cut, and brought into the Post from the woods, which were very dense"},{"pageid":56654,"pagefilename":"eccca1abfb0116833e13bb3c109b1caa.jpg","transcription":"55\nand thick in that vicinity. Between these logs the space was chincked up with small pieces of wood together with mud which took the place of mortar, as that material could not be made on account of there being no hair on hand at the Post to mix it with; so there was constantly a necessity for replenishing this substitute for mortar, for as soon as it dried it would fall out in large pieces admitting the wind and rain: the roofs of these rooms were also composed of logs, but the separations between them were filled with earth, and thus the roofs were called dirt roofs; and so heavy was the dirt piled upon them to keep out the rain, that several at first caved in. When I arrived at the Fort, it was my good luck to obtain one room made in this primitive style, and the rest of my housekeeping had to be done in tents as I kept this room for my boudoir and parlor: the floors at first were only dirt floors, and carpets when put down would immediately mold, and trunks had to be set on logs which would raise them at least a foot from the ground; or if not placed in this position everything in the trunk would become damp and moldy.

At this time however the people felt comparatively safe in going a few miles from the Fort, without being accompanied by a very strong guard of soldiers; it was a beautiful morning in May when I was informed that a picnic was on the tapis, and I also received an invitation to attend; so having gathered together most all of my palatable eatables, the Major and myself got into the carriage, and proceeded with the rest of the party to the picnic-ground, which was about two miles from the post. Every thing was merry, and lively, and so as to put all the enjoyment possible into the affair, the brass band was ordered to go with us, by General Benjamin Grierson who was the Commanding Officer of the fort.

Many had come on horse-back, but all who could crowd under a cover did so; and the unlucky individual who was compelled to proceed home as an equestrian got a very severe drenching from a very heavy thunder-shower, and by the time we reached the Fort the water was running in streams.

However as time progressed, the people began to make some improvements for their comfort; supplies were coming from government, and the officers began to build more rooms, and for the better security of their lives and to keep out the rain, they were allowed by government to have canvas called paulins to cover their roofs with; for so deep they would be compelled to put the earth on the top to keep out the rain and sun; that there was danger at any time of the roofs caving in and killing those inside.

But this style of living was at length to come to an end, as government had ordered a new post to be built of stone, and work was already commenced up on it; and both officers and their wives and also the soldiers were anticipating with high hopes, of having good and comfortable quarters to live in before another year had passed over their heads. One very pleasant amusement that we indulged ourselves with was horse-back excursions, as far as a place called Medicine Bluff, where I and others would vary our amusements, by having our photographs, taken while on horse-back, there being at the Fort an excellent artist.

I will try to describe the manner in which the council was conducted: the Indians all sat around in a circle, and they had a long pipe, which they all smoked at different times: first the greatest Chief would take a few whiffs, then he would pass it to the next in rank and thus this passing of the pipe would continue till every one had taken his puffs of smoke, and I understood that they considered this pipe smoking a necessary preliminary to the opening of their council: After this form their talk began: the principal chief first arose, stating his grievances and saying what the Father in Washington ought to do for them: then the commanding officer would address them, having the interpreter for the Indians to translate it for them into their own language; next another chief would make his statement and so on till all the principal ones had been heard in their turn.

It then became a rule that every train which came to the fort had to be searched; and in this one, that was captured was hidden many gallons of whiskey, the discovery being made when searching it. The morning, that I started out on my journey it was raining slightly and a little while after commencing out travelling; it settled into a heavy rain which continued for nine days consecutively: imagine the condition of the road! it was beyond description; the nights were so dark that one could only discern the road or any object a few feet in advance. There were hills ditches and stumps of old trees to be rode over, and the second day out one old mule in front of the ambulance began to peg out: about every half mile and especially when we came to a  puddle of water, he would lie himself down in the puddle, in front of the other three mules and refuse to go on, and no persuasion from whip, or voices, could make him proceed until he"},{"pageid":56663,"pagefilename":"b923301b7bbbd9431060a7af8adeef7a.jpg","transcription":"64\nwas ready.

I expected that by the time I reached the bottom of the hollow, that not only myself but every thing else connected with the conveyance would be smashed into pieces; but strange to relate that all that was broken was the pole and the front spring of the ambulance. I there had to alight and plod up the muddy bank of earth; and the only way the conveyance could be raised; was by attaching ropes to it and placing mules on the top of the embankment, thus giving them a foothold on the ground by which means, they were enabled to pull it up.

There were very many Indians and also Negroes settled around it, and trying to farm and cultivate the land: the latter people had been slaves to the Cherokees and Seminoles before the emancipation of the colored race. The houses of Fort Arbuckle were old, broken down, and patched up affairs; scarcely tenantable for habitation. The next day I proceeded on my journey and shortly afterwards met Major Yard of our regiment who was accompanied by his bride and they were en route for Fort Sill: he had married a lady belonging to one of our old New York families; they had taken their bridal tour, and then proceeded to Fort Leavenworth where a detachment of recruits awaited to be placed under his command to go to Fort Sill The lady made many wry faces, at coming so far out of civilization, but her feelings must have gone down to zero when she settled down in a log-house at Fort Sill."},{"pageid":56665,"pagefilename":"270e040643a34dc80bc076e8edcee6c3.jpg","transcription":"66\nthe rain still continued, and dark nights prevailed, and one night about 9 P.M. after being settled in camp, the sentinel informed my husband, that his prisoner had escaped, it being so dark he could not see and the man had climbed out of the wagon in which he was confined: the supposition was however that the man had bribed the guard; for the very soldier from whom he had escaped was afterwards convicted of theft and found his abode in a prison cell: however, this man's wagons and animals were carried in safely to the town of Van Buren, and turned over to the sheriff.

We could not tell what was best to do; but atlength, the passengers of both stages confered together, and resolved that the only possible method, they could think of was to unhitch the horses from the stags, and then they themselves unite their muscular strength, to lift each stage on its desired side of the creek, and I being the only lady of the party was allowed as a compliment to keep my seat; but the fact of the matter was, the sleep had so benumbed my faculties, that I allowed myself to be a passive agent in the hands of others: and the male members of whom there were about six accomplished this feat of strength; the horses were afterwards led around through the woods to their respective stages and again we were travelling on our journey, so after two more days of riding, we arrived at Fort Sill at 9 o'clock in the evening\nChapter VI\nEntry into the log house -- Reception there -- Sickness-- Stampede of horses and other incidents. \nIt was in the evening of the last day of April 1870 that I found myself in my log house once more, but during my absence a"},{"pageid":56678,"pagefilename":"f344610591f6e254de29fd7ceb989e50.jpg","transcription":"79\nchange had taken place. As I have before stated, the roofs of the houses were covered with earth to prevent the rain from penetrating through, but the dirt piled on our log house had proven too heavy for its supports and what should I see in the middle of the parlor but a log about four feet square which while we were absent had to be placed there in order to prevent the roof from tumbling in; so one may imagine how safe these buildings were for dwellings. As soon as our arrival became known many old friends came rushing in to give us a welcome and we again settled down to frontier life. I forgot to mention that during my late visit to New York City I had the pleasure of attending a grand ball where I was introduced to the Grand Duke Alexis of Russia and in honor of whom this splendid ball was given. Mrs General Fremont appeared to be enjoying his society and at the time I saw him she was adjusting a boutonniere of roses on his coat. To return to our army life again, it was only five days after reaching Fort Sill, that I was taken down with malarial fever: at this time the garrison was in a fearful state as regarded sickness; there being over three hundred a day on the sick list, and it was of such a dangerous type, that it assumed the form of typhoid and many persons died from it: there was also at that time a scarcity of quinine at the post, and"},{"pageid":56679,"pagefilename":"a58ba5159a105920c7f02585bd15b079.jpg","transcription":"80\nthat was occassioned by a contract physician making an error in forming an application for medicine, for the fort: and the consequence was that his application had to be returned for correction; and on this account they were left without the proper supply of this article (quinine) which really is the only medicine which counteracts the malarial influence of that climate. I had a terrible siege of this disease; and day after day I found myself prostrated with the fever; it making such fearful inroads on my health, that in two weeks, I had lost twenty pounds. While looking from my window one day I saw great clouds of dust and also hundreds of horses running in all directions: my first idea was that the Indians, were surprising the Fort; but such was not the case; it was a stampede of the cavalry horses. It appeared that while the horses were grazing some silly soldier gave a great shout at some of the animals grazing near him; off they ran going like wild-fire and by this means the rest got started and in a few minutes seven or eight hundred horses were plunging around in every direction; some ran as far away as ten miles and a few were never recovered. The only living animal which received material injury, was a young Buffalo calf that was being raised as a pet: it had been captured only a few days previous by some troops, while"},{"pageid":56680,"pagefilename":"83b89a2847e85bcfada9065de2212919.jpg","transcription":"81\non an Indian scout, and at this time was picketed for security, on a plot of grass to graze.

The stampede of horses is often brought on from the slightest reason, and every precaution has to be taken to prevent a panic of these animals for which purpose during the day while grazing, they are universally hobbled and in the night unless in a stable they are tied securely, to a thick rope called a horse-line. The Indians were again beginning to get troublesome; heretofore it was understood that their present state was that of a quiescent nature; which for them meant a state of peace, and they were allowed ingress, and egress, in regard to the garrison, whever [sic] they saw fit: their regular camps were about five miles from our fort, and were under the superintendance, of the Indian Agent, who at that time was a good quaker.

During the Spring months, much enjoyment was experienced by me in taking horse-back rides; and Major Van De Wiele had several very fine horses of his own. One day I was riding with him and when some miles from the post; his horse which was a very powerful beast got the bit in his mouth and off he rushed as fast as his limbs could carry him, leaving me a long distance behind; in his John Gilpin ride my husband lost his cap, and had hard work to keep the saddle himself: all the officers ran out to see what had happened, but that sensible horse had merely wished to go home, and when the Major got in front of his dwelling, the horse stood perfectly still as much as to say dismount! which my husband did having been well shaken up During the Summer of 1870 at Fort Sill it was very warm and but little enjoyment could be had till after the sun went down; and then the climate was so damp that to remain out-doors, in the evening, was a sure precursor"},{"pageid":56682,"pagefilename":"4ebc63001253d73bb84600abbcec1779.jpg","transcription":"83\nof a fine fever that next day.

One night I was sitting by the open window about twelve o'clock and was preparing to retire; while unfastening my hair I happened to look up and spied a tall Indian with his head in the window and looking over my shoulder; being such a late hour the aspect was very unpleasant and startling, and a sharp scream from me told the fact, that he was seen so off he rushed: another time when I was ill with my husband sitting by and reading to me, some slight noise diverted my attention and all at once I saw"},{"pageid":56683,"pagefilename":"4ceaee7c90bf3712799258ae087651ca.jpg","transcription":"84\na tall powerful Indian, with bowie knife, and pistol, standing by our side; I was almost paralyzed as a shot or plunge of the knife from him could have made short work of both me and my husband; the Major got on the outside of the Indian, and then took him out of the house; and after that time all doors were kept secured, although the officers on account of the heat had been in the habit of living with every door open to get all the air possible. In the meantime while the troops were able to remain in garrison on account of the apparent peace of the Indians; the building of a new post had begun, and the soldiers did nearly all the work; only a small extra force of men, being employed by government: the houses were built of stone and were nicely planed; each one consisted of a large parlor, a large sleeping room with a wide hall, and back of that arrangement was a dining room and a kitchen and over those; two nice rooms for servants; so we found sufficient space in which we were enabled to keep house nicely, and two dwellings joined each other having a beautiful wide and long piazza which took in the length of both houses giving us abundance of room for a promenade and exercise.

It appeared that some Indians of one party of the Creek Nation, had been hung by the other party for horse-stealing: both sides were at this time struggling. for supremacy, and upon this hanging taking place, they used it as a grievance to go to war between themselves; one side numbered nine hundred, and the other side between three and four hundred.

Great sufferings were experienced by the officers and troops through the previous Fall and Winter in hunting for these very Indians. In Texas and the Indian Territory, there is often a climatic change, in the weather, which is called Northers: the winds come down from the high mountains, and in the space of about ten or fifteen minutes, the atmosphere changes from that of a summer temperature, to that of a freezing winter one, and the animal or man exposed to the change is apt to suffer greatly from the cold, so that it is necessary for one, to have an outfit of heavy clothing suitable for winter, as well as that of lighter material.

The ponies belonging to the Indians were taken from them and sold to the highest bidders; and the money obtained from the sale, was spent in purchasing cattle, to stock the farms, which had been laid out for them, on the Indian reservation: thus being dispossessed of their ponies, they could not in a large body steal away from the Reserve and go on with their slaughter and bloody deeds. they were also relieved of their fire-arms, and one may rest assured, that then there was no end to their general discontent During the following winter the aspect of affairs was more"},{"pageid":56725,"pagefilename":"568c3a5b7caff3d3c4e0caed35975c07.jpg","transcription":"126\nquiet than it had been for a long season, and the troops, had now some time to rest themselves: at length the Spring, opened and there took place a general change of Companies from one post to another; so it was in April 1875 that I with the Major and his troop set out en route for Fort Griffen in Texas. We had an easy journey of nine days at the end of which time we reached our destination: the country we had just passed over, was much more devoid of vegetation than that we had left behind in the Indian Territory. The principal feature of our journey was the Red River, being a mile wide and very treacherous, as it is full of quick-sand which makes it necessary to know the path in order to cross safely: when the river was high or swollen by rains it was extremely dangerous, and several old wagons were seen that had been swamped in the quick-sand, probably never to be drawn out: there was plenty of wild game on the road so our party fared well in the eating line. On arriving at at Fort Griffen great was my surprise at the general appearance of the place, and the contrast between it, and the Fort, I had left was very great indeed.

The town of Griffen was one of the most outlawed places that a person could imagine; they were shooting there all day long, and shooting, through all the hours of the night was a general occurrence, and scarcely a day passed without some one being killed, and very often the military had to be called upon, to help the civil authority to quell the disturbances.

The summer had passed and the work of the troops in the field was comparatively small when estimated with what they had been compelled to perform the previous summers: the reason of this was that the capture which had been made by Major Van De Wiele of the Kiowas and Comanches during the the previous year had really broken, the back-bone of the Indian war, in that vicinity; and the most rebellious and bloodthirsty Indian characters; who had been used to roaming over that portion of the plains were then prisoners in the old fort of St Augustine in the state of Florida at which place an officer of the army was trying to civilize"},{"pageid":56728,"pagefilename":"87c8b81d4d130daedb0e36576885135a.jpg","transcription":"129\nthem After their capture, they had been sent from Fort Sill to that country; in order to separate them from the Indians who evinced a disposition to remain quiet on the reservation.

Brussels sent some fine mantels the handsomest of which was of plain black Belgian marble ornamented with columns and mouldings of dark red marble; there were also nine more marble mantles, two of which were white statuary marble, of Louis the fourteenth style and they were very elegant; also a pair of marble vases five feet high of royal red marble in the Medici style, then there was the inlaid flooring, and wood carving; one of the finest pieces of carving, was an oaken pulpit with canopy, and it stood on one of the principal avenues of the building; the design was panels in the frame-work of the pulpit, containing scriptual scenes in relief; the canopy or sounding board, was surrounded, by graceful winged figures, and the mouldings were made of elaborately carved flower-work in relief. We now come to the laces; I found these in a large pavilion containing a collection of the finest kind. which to me and most ladies was one of the interesting departments of the exhibition; I will now mention a"},{"pageid":56747,"pagefilename":"7650977ae0211c5ad4452322b8930817.jpg","transcription":"148\na few specimens of these lovely laces, one was a parasol cover made of point de Venice valued at two hundred and five dollars; a handkerchief valued at one hundred and eleven dollars; a fan at eighty three dollars, and laces from half an inch to four inches wide at seventy six dollars a yard; these were mostly Valenciennes laces, there was also one piece of six inches in width at one hundred and five dollars per yard; a lace dress at one thousand two hundred and twenty five dollars and another at two thousand one hundred and seventy five dollars; and a black lace shawl, valued at one thousand, four hundred, and eight dollars, these were but a few of the numerous samples, put on exhibition, and were more like the work of a fairy, than that made by human hands. The specimens of tapestry were magnificent; one was about eight feet high and eight feet wide, representing the gods of Olympus and all their attributes after Audran; the ground work of these tapestries were interwoven with silver threads, and the pictures were in medallions; there was also a large one representing a hunting party, consisting of nineteen figures of ladies and gentlemen, some were in boats on the lake, and others on horseback on the shore; both were in brilliant colors and were quite artistic being woven by hand, and very valuable. There were other embroideries and also fine cotton,"},{"pageid":56748,"pagefilename":"1a9eb76ca9e4a5269de9315ce4bc6c66.jpg","transcription":"149\nand linen fabrics; one piece of table linen measured one hundred and twenty three inches in width. In this department was an embroidering machine, which was a wonderful ingenuous apparatus, and did its work excellently: it had a universal feed which by means of a crank could be made to run in any direction, and guide the materials to any pattern, and the simple turning of a screw changed the embroidery from a tapestry or tufted to a chain stitch. It could be made to sew on flat braid, or that which was turned and would embroider on fine tulle, as well as the heaviest cloth and leather: there was also an improvement to enable the workman, to place a ready made article of clothing, over the work, and plate of the machine and beautifully embroider it on one side; this machine with its contrivances was as much a curiosity as the sewing machine when it was first invented. After finishing up the main building, I wended my way to Machinery Hall which place on account of the many machines by steam, seemed almost like \"Bedlam let-loose\" the grand piece of work there, was the Corlies [Corliss] Engine, which kept the machinery, in every part of the building in motion: this was the motive power, and when it stopped or began all machines did the same; it was a stupendous work of art, but while most of its arms, and propelling powers were massive and ponderous, there were some parts, especially"},{"pageid":56749,"pagefilename":"d54c3da0675ff60acd1452a65fa75e01.jpg","transcription":"150\none rod or piston, which was no larger than a man's finger, and this comparatively minute portion, moved up and down as fast, and seemed to stand, the wear and tear, as well as the other gigantic proportions. The carding of wool was an interesting process; also the spooling of cotton; the weaving of carpets, and the making and printing of wall paper: the making and filling, of United States cartridges, by women and girls was also a pleasing sight. From Machinery Hall, I passed to Agricultural Hall, where I viewed specimens of all the foreign as well as our plants and flowers; there was the Palm of Arabia with its large shading leaves; the Spanish Dagger of Texas, with its sharp points and blades; the Muscal plant of Mexico from which the people of that state distill a drink sufficiently strong, to make crazy men of them, in a short time, and quantities of specimens of Cactus, all of which our arid plains are dotted over with in place of trees, and many other kinds  too numerous to mention. The Art Gallery and Annex were next visited; my eyes never tired of feasting on the rare painting and sculptuary, which met one's gaze no matter which way they would turn; so life-like and elegantly carved was the statuary that it scarcely seemed the work of human hands: one called the veiled lady, was a great piece of art, the veil was long but made in such a manner, that the eyes, and all the other features"},{"pageid":56750,"pagefilename":"225de163795d66e6c6f487d2901d81f3.jpg","transcription":"151\ncould be distinctly seen through it; another lovely piece was Cupid whispering in the ear, the Child's first grief represented, a little child in the act of drinking from a cup, the saucer having fallen from her hand laid in two pieces at her feet, while tears were rolling down her cheeks; another figure by the same name was holding a dead kitten. One of the finest pictures was the Wedding of the Prince of Wales which was lent to the United States by the Queen of England; this picture was guarded by a policeman all the time, and if a cane or parasol was pointed towards it, the peremtory order of (do not point) came from that policeman's lips. Another beautiful picture was The Offerings of Venice; it represented persons offering fruits, and flowers, and doing homage to the Queen; and Prometheus chained to the Rock was grand and large. In all the different departments much rare and splendid talent was exhibited; another object of interest was the Brewery, it contained a very high cupola which I reached in an elevator, and had a fine view of the city. After visiting the Menagerie, and all other points of interest I proceeded to go through Fairmount Park, and it is in a portion of this park that the exhibition was situated being a very fine park, and producing a favorable impression on all who visit it. Carpenter's Hall was the next part to examine, and this was the place where our first Congress"},{"pageid":56751,"pagefilename":"6fe8b36628eada3df68330716d8802b7.jpg","transcription":"152\nsigned the Declaration of Independence just one hundred years before: in it were the same chairs, that the signers occupied and also the pen that was used. I then went to Independence Hall where I found arranged the old curiosities, and among them an old cracked bell, which was rung at the Declaration of Independence. Having one more day to dispose of I made an excursion along the banks of the Schuylkill; it was a beautiful little river, and boats were constantly plying their way backwards and forwards with visitors: the great point of interest was the Wissahicken Falls, and there is also a small river of the same name which runs into the Schuylkill; it is more like a creek, and is mostly used for rowing boats on, having very pretty banks on each side covered with grand old trees, and beautiful moss; it is a very pleasant and romantic spot and that location is used as a summer resort by the Philadelphians. On the way back to the city one of the deck hands was seen to wave his handkerchief, it was supposed by the pilot of our steamboat to be a signal of distress, and accordingly he steered his boat along the side of that one and stopped, offering assistance if there was any trouble; when to his surprise he was informed that the man was waving his handkerchief, to one of his female friends on the boat. The pilot was very angry and loudly denounced the man who would be so foolish and"},{"pageid":56752,"pagefilename":"2f54ec518f74910edc8af19336f1e352.jpg","transcription":"153\ngiddy, when he should have been attending to his business; and threatened to report him to the owner of the steamboat. It was now the last of September, and I prepared to return to New York City; I took the cars, and proceeded back to Long Branch, which at that time was quite deserted, as the ocean after the first part of September, becomes very boisterous, and rough, so that it is then almost impossible to bathe in it. Long Branch is a barren and sandy looking place, very little vegetation, except what has been cultivated through artificial means, and many of the grounds belonging to the hotels and private residences, are embellished by this artificial manner: at Long Branch I took a steamboat and proceeded to New York; the day was very windy and the waves on the ocean, dashed so high, that the steamboat almost stood on its side: on board the boat were several parties of western people, who had been visiting the Centennial Exposition, and they had never before been on the ocean. At first from the tenor of their comments, they were agreeably surprised, and thought it pleasant enough to sail on the ocean; but in about half an hour, their complexion took another hue and every one of them began to make their way as fast as possible, either for a place to lie down on, or something to which they could hold fast, as they were showing very"},{"pageid":56753,"pagefilename":"43001fe44d67426ce94c4a10805f2062.jpg","transcription":"154\ngreat symptoms of sea-sickness: in a few hours the wharf was reached, and they were really glad to set their feet on terra firma, as they had by this time changed their minds, as to the enjoyment experienced on rough water. During the Autumn and Winter of 1876 New York City was very lively; filled both with foreigners and people, from all parts of the Union, who had come to visit the Centennial Exposition, and surely: they could not return to their homes without visiting the city of Gotham: the hotels and boarding houses were so full and crowded at this time, that sufficient rooms could not be secured to supply the wants of the many travellers; and mattresses had to be placed in the corridors and halls to accommodate transient visitors. After the closing of the Exposition, a great variety of articles were brought to New York City from Philadelphia and placed on exhibition for sale during the month of December; for the foreigners did not care to carry them back to their homes, if they could dispose of them in this country. Accordingly a great deal of merchandise, and fancy articles were sold and very many were offered, at half the price charged for them at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. The month of December 1876 was drawing to a close, and celebrations for the Centennial Christmas were gotten up on a grand scale. I attended Christmas"},{"pageid":56754,"pagefilename":"af53072ff10129b7c338e1e0f0e864bf.jpg","transcription":"155\nservices, at old Trinity Church on Broadway opposite to Wall Street; there the vocal exercises consisted of a fine choir and choruses of many hundred voices: a brass band and two great organs, furnished the instrumental musical part of the programme. The performances were very grand, and much appreciated by those who were sufficiently lucky, to find space, within those sacred walls; as every inch of sitting or standing room was monopolized, besides hundreds had to leave not being able to gain entrance: great festivities were kept up during Christmas week and I enjoyed them exceedingly. On the thirty first of December 1876 at twelve o'clock at night, the bells tolled out the first one hundred years, of our grand, self-made and glorious Republic, and on the next change of the bells, was welcomed in the new-born year of 1877, and for a time my readers I bid you adieu hoping that the details found in this little volume will not be unacceptable as I know all to be real matter of facts and not in any instance a myth."}],"title":"Susie P.

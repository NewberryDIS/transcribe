And therefore (through divine assistance) I shall endeavour to give a particular & real account of this affair. Before I come to declare matter of fact I shall premise some things necessary to be understood for the better clearing of our ensuing discourse. \nThe Christian Indians in New England have their dwellings in sundry jurisdictions of the English colonies, & that at a considerable distance from each other, more particularly. \nI. Upon the island of Nantucket  & Martha's viniard(1), in which two islands there {are}[crossed out] inhabitants['ants' crossed out] many, hundreds of them that visibly profess the gospel(2). These Indians have felt very little of this war comparatively, for the English that dwell upon those islands have held a good correspondency with those Indians all the time of the war, as they did before the war began. The only sufferings of these Christian Indians was of their coming up in the summer during the war to work for the English in the Mas. Colony, whither many scores of them did usually repair to work; whereby they & their families were accommodated with necessary clothing, which is scarce & dear upon those islands. Besides several of these Indians belonging to the islands being at work at some of the English towns \n(1) This island was so named from Martin Prin[first and last name underlined] or Pring[underlined], its first discoverer.

Because the English were so jealous & filled with animosity against all Indians without exception, hereby they tasted but little of the effects of the war, & therefore they will not so properly fall under our consideration. \nII. Another considerable number of Christian Indians live within the jurisdiction of new Plymouth called the cape Indians; these also (through gods favor) have enjoyed much peace & quiet by their English neighbors, & several of them have served the English in the war, especially in the heat of the war, & did acquit themselves courageously & faithfully(1). Indeed at the beginning of the war the English of that colony were suspicious of them & slow to improve any of them in the war, though divers of those Christian Indians manifested themselves ready & willing to engage with the English against their enemies, & this is so much the more remarkable that those Indians proved so faithful to the English interest considering the war first began in the colony of Plymouth, by the rashness and folly of Philip Chief Sachem of the Indian in those parts, unto whom or to some of his people doubtless these praying Indians were allied by affinity or consanguinity. Therefore good reason it is to attribute it to the grace & favor of god, & to the ef- \n(1) The celebrated Church performed scarcely an expedition or exploit without the help of some of these Indians.

There were a few other Praying Indians, about 40 persons, that began to embrace the Christian religion who lived near to New Norwich in Connecticut Colony, who were taught by that worthy and Rev.d minister, Mr. James Fitch[underlined], pastor at Norwich, who had taken much pains to declare the gospel to the Indians in these parts. But the chief Sachem, Uncas, & his eldest son Orneko(1) not being encouragers of the cristian religion (though otherwise they & their people have joined with the English in the war & proved faithful, especially against their ancient & implacable enemies the Narragensets(underlined), I say this Sachem & people being generally averse to entertain Christian religion, or countenance any such as did among his people incline to it, hence it came to pass that those few in those parts that prayed to god are not distinguishable from the rest, and so nothing of remark is spoken of any of them, and hence will not be subjects of this discourse. \nIV.

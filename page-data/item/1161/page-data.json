Chief cause for mental distress: \nself-reproach, because if [crossed out] (although this is no new [underlined] thought for me) I must have unintentionally done much to make those dependent upon me unhappy. Also depression because it is too late to reprieve anything and not worth changing for the few remaining years of my life. Dr. merely corroborated my own opinion of myself (enforced by statement of abnormality) thereby adding to inferiority feeling.\nDr. told me I had never liked my mother. The inference is that my self-reproach at her death was due to this sub-conscious feeling. But self-reproach was merely for not being with her.

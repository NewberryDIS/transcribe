The day after I wrote to you from St Joseph we left that place and took a northern direction through Buckhannan & Andrew Co through as fine country as I ever saw in my life the country here is well improved and looks something like Kentucky in many particulars - you can see the negroes in the fields and the wells are deep and have windlasses - all old Kentuck' style.  The news here from the Peak is very good - and we are all in good Spirits - there are 17 of us Schuylerites in company and we think of going through together -\nYesterday (Sunday) we layed up in camp - Some of us passed our time reading, some writing some playing checkers & others were hunting, they killed 47 squirrels besides numerous rabbits, pigeons &c Charles cooked some lite? corn bread yesterday it weighed 4 1/2 lbs to the square inch.  Sofe? Manlorey? got up some of the same kind of bread only his was made of flour - Jim Doyle says it make first rate razor strops - We have two loaves of the bread you cooked for us yet - we have plenty"},{"pageid":55705,"pagefilename":"056d10011b4d846e8ab7f2b35358ddef.jpg","transcription":"of milk - I milk the cows for all the milk we can use we throw away some 2 gal every day - we live first rate and enjoy our selves very well - We expect to lay up a few days out on the Mos River and let the cattle rest & wait for grass - then we will leave for the plains - I should be very glad to hear from home but do not expect any news from there for some time yet.\nThe weather which has been very cold for some days past is now more pleasant - in fact it is quite warm and prospects for grass are very flattering.  I see a great many hand carts fitting out in St Joe for the peak - I trust that every man who travels that road and pulls his own cart & provisions may be richly rewarded for he will certainly deserve it - I believe I do not know any thing else that would be calculated to interest you - I only droped these few lines to let you know that \"I still live\"  You shall hear from me again at convenient points before we leave the settlements -\nTry and do the best you can for your selves untill I am able to assist you which I hope may be at no distant day.\nGive my best wishes to my friends & believe I remain yours as ever\nGeorge Smither\nP.S.

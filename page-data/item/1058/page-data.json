Carroll & yourself at the agency one week from that time, the 29th of this month, for the purpose of holding a conference on the subject of your mission. The people did not deem it expedient for them to take any step on the suggestion, because there was a constituted authority duly authorized by the whole Cherokee people to represent their interests and to attend to the public affairs of the nation;- and, I regret to say, that the shortness of the time you fined upon, made it impossible for the chiefs & the representatives of the Cherokee people to meet you: Carroll at the time & place you suggested. The great fatigue they had undergone in attending  the election so remotely from the place of holding the general council of the nation, and the agency House, - and the consequent privation which they experienced from the very unexpected & seemingly unnecessary delay in bringing the election to a close, by their exposure to rains, hunger, & in circumstances in connection with the fact that their crops of corn having not, as yet, been generally laid by,- which, when duly considered by the commissions, I cannot doubt will be properly appreciated. Permit me to assure, sir, that it would have given the chiefs and the representatives of the Cherokee people pleasure, had it been practicable for them to have met and taken their old friend & brother soldier, His excellency gov. Carroll,  by the right hand of friendship.- But, their peculiar situation as states, and the time & place suggested by you, would not allow them to do so. I regret this more especially, as the very reasonable request which I had made this you to Major Currey on the 7th instant, to change the place which he had designated for holding the election, so as to hold it either at Red Clay or at the Agency,- had not been complied with; because the convenience of the commissioners as well as the chiefs"},{"pageid":71315,"pagefilename":"630eaf09d9f37298305646850977b915.jpg","transcription":"chiefs & people of this nation, would all have been consulted & accommodated.\nI beg leave to remark in candor frankness, without intending any disrespect, that, from what had passed between us at the interview we had at the agency on your first arrival there, and from what has since taken place, and the course pursued, I feel somewhat disappointed and as if I had reasons to apprehend that I have been deceived regarding the frank, liberal & impartial step which I had been inclined to believe you would take in hinging before the nation the business entrusted to your Commission by the United States government.

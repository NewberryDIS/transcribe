Carroll & yourself at the agency one week from that time, the 29th of this month, for the purpose of holding a conference on the subject of your mission. The people did not deem it expedient for them to take any step on the suggestion, because there was a constituted authority duly authorized by the whole Cherokee people to represent their interests and to attend to the public affairs of the nation;- and, I regret to say, that the shortness of the time you fined upon, made it impossible for the chiefs & the representatives of the Cherokee people to meet you: Carroll at the time & place you suggested. The great fatigue they had undergone in attending  the election so remotely from the place of holding the general council of the nation, and the agency House, - and the consequent privation which they experienced from the very unexpected & seemingly unnecessary delay in bringing the election to a close, by their exposure to rains, hunger, & in circumstances in connection with the fact that their crops of corn having not, as yet, been generally laid by,- which, when duly considered by the commissions, I cannot doubt will be properly appreciated. Permit me to assure, sir, that it would have given the chiefs and the representatives of the Cherokee people pleasure, had it been practicable for them to have met and taken their old friend & brother soldier, His excellency gov. Carroll,  by the right hand of friendship.- But, their peculiar situation as states, and the time & place suggested by you, would not allow them to do so. I regret this more especially, as the very reasonable request which I had made this you to Major Currey on the 7th instant, to change the place which he had designated for holding the election, so as to hold it either at Red Clay or at the Agency,- had not been complied with; because the convenience of the commissioners as well as the chiefs"},{"pageid":71315,"pagefilename":"630eaf09d9f37298305646850977b915.jpg","transcription":"chiefs & people of this nation, would all have been consulted & accommodated.\nI beg leave to remark in candor frankness, without intending any disrespect, that, from what had passed between us at the interview we had at the agency on your first arrival there, and from what has since taken place, and the course pursued, I feel somewhat disappointed and as if I had reasons to apprehend that I have been deceived regarding the frank, liberal & impartial step which I had been inclined to believe you would take in hinging before the nation the business entrusted to your Commission by the United States government.

This was the signal to go ahead, and on we went, a few miles, and took the woods again, in the direction of head quarters. After awhile, we grazed again and then went on along an old path to Conesauga River about 3 miles from Spring Place. We had stoppd here but a few minutes, when we were informed that the Lawyers were in town! But they gave up the hunt + left the place. We were then marched into head quarters after night. On Sunday Morning, the 23rd, we were informed by Mr John A. Bell, that he had made a conditional arrangement for our release, - namely if we would give bond & security, without a trial, for our appearance at court, and desist from our operations until the termination of the case, the Colonel would set us at liberty. Believing that this was just about as fair play as we could expect under existing circumstances, we consented. After breakfast, bailiff Smyth, one of the Guard, served the warrants upon us, and we were ordered to go into the Colonel's room. He informed us that he had no personal feelings in the matter; that he was deeply concerned for the welfare of the Cherokee people; - that the Lawyers had gotten a great deal of our money, - that they had never done us any good, + did not care for us, so they got our money; - and that, so far as he was concerned + had the power, they should never have any more of our money. We signed the bonds and were set at liberty. As we were about starting, the Colonel offered to lend us money to bear our expenses home, if any of us were needy. We thanked him, told him we had money + departed. So endeth the chapter."},{"pageid":71334,"pagefilename":"89b459abba4542dfba6d280d12c5a0a1.jpg","transcription":"Now, what meaneth all this? If we had sinned against the laws of the State, was not the civil authority fully competent to bring us to justice? Had we ever defied or resisted a civil process? - No. - Why, then, should the civil authority be superceded by the military? And why were we marched off, in great military parade, about 56 miles from the county in which it is pretended we had rebelled? And, again, why keep us in lawless and false imprisonment 10 or 12 days, and trail & dodge about through the forests and swamps of the surrounding country, in order to deceive and triumph over the civil officers of the country? But this is not all. Is it fair & honorable that we should be compelled to give bonds for our appearance at court, previous to an investigation of the matter? Strange, indeed, that we should be compelled to submit to a government & then be denied the most common privileges of that government! We ask, again, what meaneth all this?\nHaving been for some time past, an eye witness of the strange manoeuvring and crooked course of certain dear creatures in this country, I will attempt an explanation of this marvellous affair. Be it known, then, that the Cherokees, under existing circumstances, are capable of committing three kinds of sins; namely, legal sins, party sins and policy sins; or, in other words, sins against the law, sins against the party, and sins against the darling policy. Sinners of the first class, in many instances, obtain forgiveness by submitting to the party or policy, but it seems there is no mercy for the two latter, neither in his Excellency at Milledgeville nor in his Majesty at the White House. Now, although it is very difficult for a Cherokee to breathe in this country without transgressing one or other of the many exterminating laws of 1831-2-3- or 4, yet, every body knows that we have not violated any law in this matter. What, then, is the conclusion of the whole matter? This great military outrage was committed upon our characters, our persons & our property, and upon the civil authorities of the country, too, at the instance and for the gratification of a few very conspicuous gentlemen of a certain party, and that, in subserviency to a beloved policy."},{"pageid":71335,"pagefilename":"01159d420757b7ea08a2620d6d2286e3.jpg","transcription":"But if we look at this extraordinary affair in another point of view, it will appear still more strange!

I am confident all this would have been done before now and the existing difficulties between them and the United States adjusted to the satisfaction of great advantage of the common people, had it not been for the improper inferference and undue influence exercised over them by a few persons who have very little Inidan blood in them, but who, by the means of of a little education and the wealth obtained under former treaties have been able so to manage affairs as to deprive the common Indians of their rights and to asume the whole power, wealth and authority of this nation into their own hands. The persons to whom I allude are the Reservees and old enrolled emigrants under the treaties of 1817 and 1819. Of the former class there are 342 who enter their names for reservations according to the provisions of those treaties; and agreed to become citizens of the United States and to continue to reside permanently on their reservations within the country they had ceded to the United States within the chartered limits of Georgia, North Carolina, Tenessee and Alabama; and of the latter who agreed to remove and receive pay for their improvemen, some of whom received commutation of transportation and subsistence to their newborns, there were ten hundred and twenty seven who never removed.

We must therefore leave it for mere important matters. Mr Schereshorn as you will perceive, has not yet exhibited satisfactory credentials to prove that he is endowed with full power to make a final Treaty. He admits that the Treaty already submitted may be considered as rejected by the people, but he has proposed no substitute although he persists in declaring that some Treaty upon the basis of that which he is aware has been rejected, is the only one which will be received.

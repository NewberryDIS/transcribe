I do not think we can do any better now than to get Mr. Hugh’s screw, if he has got it yet.   If you can get the screw and bar for 10 or 11 dollars, I do not know but it would be best to get the bar, too. I wish you could come home to help put them together, and to help a little in working the last of Cenhadwr. With my very small mechanical genius (my entire lack of unclear power rather), this accident will hinder me very much. I don’t know how much trouble it will be to get it to work. marked through “The box of our screw is 8 inches square.” Father thinks perhaps it will work without putting the box of the new screw into the upper horingoutue?; but put the upper piece of Mr. H.’ screw under the upper piece of our screw. The box of our screw is 7 7/8 inch by 8 7/8. The distance between the upright pieces is 3 feet 4 inch. and one eighth. Henry has got a string the length. We have got more than enough for the last form set but there has got to be some set again which will have to go in. - \nI wish you would get some twine in Whitesboro, if possible, to do up the Cenhadwr, cotton twine will answer if you can get no other.

The slightest intervention\nof supernatural power at any moment from the\ntime the villain Guiteau conceived his dastardly\npurpose until death closed the sad scene would\nhave averted the final catastrophe. All Christendom\nand millions of other people of different\nfaiths prayed fervently and frequently from the\nhouse the fatal shot was fired until death supervened \nthat God would interfere in behalf of this\ngreat and good man, with what effect, or rather\nlack of effect, it is now needless to mention.\nFrom thousands of pulpits will now emanate\nthe old Sophistry that :God moves in a\nmysterious way,\" etc.; that \"every cloud has a\nsilver lining,\" etc,; in other words, that for\nsome reason which he does not wish to reveal,\nGod has killed President Garfield, just as he did\nPresident Lincoln, and that in due time, when\nwe fully understand the matter, we shall be\nglad of it! We know of no blessing, however,\nbut we do know of an inexpressible amount of\nsuffering caused by the untimely death of \nLincoln, and it will be hard to make the people\nbelieve that the loss of Garfield was in any way\nnecessary to their prosperity.\nSuch teaching amounts practically to telling\nthe people that the murder of the President,\nunder the circumstances, was the proper thing,\nand that Guiteau, as the agent and servant of\nGod, did a commendable deed! If the removal\nof Gen. Garfield was in obedience to the special\ndesire of providence of God, Guiteau may well\nclaim, as he does, that he was inspired to commit\nthe damnable act. Are all murders, \natrocities, and catastrophes concocted in heaven?\nVery different is the aspect of this sad affair\nto one who recognizes the fact that God rules by\nimmutable laws which are not devised, modified,\nor suspended from hour to hour, but which are\nas old as time and as permanent as the \nuniverse. \"Nothing can be more wonderful than\nthe majestic, unbroken, sublime, and eternal\nprocession of causes and effects.\" H.D.G."},{"pageid":46064,"pagefilename":"6d1371f4e660c0903d0d2b6ea248d601.jpg","transcription":"James 5.16. 1\n[[-Has the Nations prayer been\nanswered?-]]\nI Explore this sophistry_\n1.

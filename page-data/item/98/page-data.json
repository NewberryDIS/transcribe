There have been instances of girls here becoming sick in consequence of receiving food from their friends or purchasing, and therefor they made a rule in relation to it, so it has been with the other requirments of this nature; they have formed them as the case required, for example, our dining hall has been rather noisy before sitting down to the table and after rising while we were going out, Miss Whitman requested the young ladies several times to be more quiet, but this had on effect; so a new regulation was added to the others, that we should not speak at all after entering the dining hall until we sit down nor at all after rising from table.

I suppose Lewis has seen my letters that I have sent home so he has no doubts as to my existance. I had not heard of John's promotion. I hope he still remembers his ancient friends. How is Henry's health now I hope he has not forgotten that his name is one of the \"letter-writing society\" if he is rather remiss in writing. I wish John would join our league, I should be most happy to number my eldest brother among my regular corespondents & Lewis too dont you think he would add his name? I received a letter from Robert last tuesday eve. and also one from Elizabeth and Mary, I had quite a feast that night as you may well suppose. I have not answered Roberts yet. I was writing to Mary & Elizabeth when the letters came so I answered theirs. I do not think I shall be able to get a cloak, I think I had better get a thick sack which will answer the purpose pretty well, I can make that myself, it is almost imposible to get anyone to sew for me unless I got to Northhampton or Springfield which will cost me about $1.00 to go and return. I think I must get me a thick dress this vacation. They have very cold winters here and I must prepare for it. I think I shall get me some corse yarn to knit me some over-socks to walk in that my ancles may not get wet and some cruel to knit something to wear on my neck and also ears, dont you think I had better?

He said that there was only one class of females in Ceylon? who ever learned to read, they were called the dancing girls and they read in order to learn the songs. They never married and were regarded as the wives of the gods. They frequently steal children and educate them for dancing girls. He mentioned, this as one instance, a young girl who had charge of a white babe carried it out one day and the babe went to sleep, she laid it down in the shade and steped the other side of the bushes to pick some berries, while she was gone the dancing girls found the child and stole it.

And now, said Dr. Pour, \"do you wish me to tell you what it is to be a missionary? it is to take that child and teach it who its mother is, and who is the thief.

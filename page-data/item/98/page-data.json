It is, as you know, more than three months since my last letter was written, how long seems the time! Why did I thus treat my friends and self? for I am the sufferer. Alas! I am ashamed to own that I should thus yield to disappointment. A strange infatuation hung over me, I shrunk from the pen as men do from the leprosy, but I hope the spell is at length broken.\nThank you, my sister, for writing to me, and especially for making your letter short. I should like to have heard more particularly of \"the old house at home\" and the treasures clustered there, but \nimage--Jennie to Sarah\nRobert is very much in need of those vests which I took home to mend. He says if he does not have them soon he will be obliged to wear his best one every day, this would be quite too bad as he has so many at home quite good enough for that purpose. I have repented more than once that I ever took them up. I hope you will ask mother to send them soon. If there is no earlier opportunity perhaps they can be sent with Mary Thomas next Saturday. I hope they will not be forgotten as indeed this is the most important business of my letter. It is snowing a little just now. We have not had much sleighing as yet. Ask Sarah if she succeeds in cultivating her self-esteem as Mr. Fowler advised. I find it quite a task. Tell mother that I found three more of her plates down here. I will send them up at the first opportunity. I have not baked any thing yet but I will try to soon. We have no cooking stove up now. How is Mary's head now? Does she succeed in taking any treatment? I am glad to hear that you have a girl. I hope she will prove just the one mother wants. I am glad that you are again taking packs?. I hope the next time I hear you will have tried the sitz-bath. Do Sissie and Eddie go to school every day. We have had some pretty hard weather for them to go through. Cousin Henry went to see Lizzie a short time since. She is doing very well.

The regulations of our school I have already learned to love, not not only as being necessary but as the best that could be formed for a school of this size and character. There have been instances of girls here becoming sick in consequence of receiving food from their friends or purchasing, and therefor they made a rule in relation to it, so it has been with the other requirments of this nature; they have formed them as the case required, for example, our dining hall has been rather noisy before sitting down to the table and after rising while we were going out, Miss Whitman requested the young ladies several times to be more quiet, but this had on effect; so a new regulation was added to the others, that we should not speak at all after entering the dining hall until we sit down nor at all after rising from table. I suppose I should say in connection with this that when we go to table we all stand back of our own chairs until the tardy bell strikes, which is a sign for us all to be in our places, and then Miss Whitman makes"},{"pageid":24743,"pagefilename":"f7dcba5bb869174d4745682b877b068f.jpg","transcription":"the first move, so you see we may not speak before the benediction is pronounced.

And now, said Dr. Pour, \"do you wish me to tell you what it is to be a missionary? it is to take that child and teach it who its mother is, and who is the thief.

There was a man who went through the cars just before we reached Buffalo who changed the checks of the baggage of those who were going beyond Buffalo - I did not have any checked and I do not know whether or no he gave an opportunity for persons to take places in the sleeping car, but I think not.

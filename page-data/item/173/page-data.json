What a vast difference there is in persons with regard to the objects which interest them in their walk.  I have thought of this a good deal when observing the motives which seem to lead the you ladies here to indulge in that exercise.  Is it not strange that people are not prompted more from a love for the beauties of Nature to wander forth at morn, at noon, and in the still evening to gaze and admire the works of our Creator, and in thus doing be led to adore and love HIm.

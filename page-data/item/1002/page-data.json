Such were General Sheridan's intentions when Gen'l. Hazel left him at Harker the 1st of October.     Gen'l. H. says that his post would have been re-established but for your report, on account of that, however, Gen'l. Sheridan did not intend his field orders Larned relating to the sending of troops here as establishing a post at this place, but meant to leave to the future the selection of the locality for the permanent post."},{"pageid":65536,"pagefilename":"0ef97385bd3d88eaef4ca1663f7b01ef.jpg","transcription":"General Hazen came therefore, not with the idea that the post would be placed wherever he chose to locate, but on the contrary prepared to place himself wherever the post should be placed by the District and Department Commander.  Since he has been here, however, every influence has been brought to bear upon him in favor of this [underline] place as the permanent post.\n   I know that Captain Walsh is decidedly [underline] of your opinion as to the new post, and Major Roy inclines to the same, altho' he has never seen either place himself, but otherwise he [strike] you must know that the whole Arbuckle [underline] influence is for this locality rather than yours, as I believe, chiefly, out of pure antagonism to you.   Statements have been circulated that Cache CK and Medicine Bluff Creek dry up [2 words underlined], and other similarly absurd rumors [strike] stories.  The traders, already fixed in this Valley lend their assistance, especially the Shirleys, of whom Gen'l. Hazen seems to think a great deal.   Then, too, a letter to Gen'l. Hazen from General Sherman, received yesterday says \"I want you to go to Fort Cobb, and to make provisions for all the Indians who come there to keep out of the war; and I prefer that no warlike proceedings be made from that quarter.  Both of the Agents, Boon and Wynkoop are ordered there also with the annuity goods..........   The only safety of the well disposed Indians now is in rendezvousing at Fort Cobb.

At his request the Arbuckle saw mill has been packed up and held in readiness to come here, he expects to start it as soon as he reaches that post, have it put up in some \"fine maple walnut and cedar lumber\" described by the Shirleys as on the head of Sugar Creek, ten miles East, beyond the burnt Shanklin Agency -and go to work building here for the winter at least.\n   You well know what that will lead to.  It is jut the way the post happened to be built here before, the troops camped here in the Fall, and gradually, thro' the winter so much work was done that it was concluded best not to move in the spring - altho' it has never been intended to locate permanently here.  In this way posts have often been disadvantageously located.  It will be a pity to have this occur again, especially after so much pains was taken by you to intelligently ascertain and report upon the best locality for a new post.\n    General Hazen does not think General Sheridan has changed his mind, but seems to construe Gen'l.

The Reservation of these people, are per Medicine Lodge Treaty referred to by Gen'l. Sherman, is not here, but as follows,  its boundaries are, North. Washita River; East, the 98th Mer.-Chickasaw Line;  South, Red River & its No. Fork; West, 100th Mer. or Texas line.    Gen'l. Sherman, by his letter, plainly intends that these Indians should ultimately go onto the proper reservation.    Doubtless if he knew that they were now here, ready to go into their own country at once as is the fact, he would not object to their doing so.    And, as it is intended that the new post in this region shall be the location of the Agency and depot for these Indians, it is certainly better, that, if it can be, it be located at first at some central point in their Reservation rather than here, North of the Washita, not on their reservation at all.

Here game is scarce and beef has to be given them, there buffalo are plenty and will be all the winter.   We know that they can be kept out of Texas better with the troops there, than here.\n    But aside from all reasons why it is better for these Indians to be collected near a post there than one here -- the advantages of that location over this, as a position for a permanent military post, must be well remembered.  That is somewhere, this is nowhere, out of the way.    Think of the difference as a defensible position, and as regards health, the water, the air, the wood, and also the grass.    The latter point should be especially borne in mind, as it is probable that post will be chiefly garrisoned by cavalry.    There the grass is superb, the grazing good even in mid winter, here there is no good grass at the best season, and no grazing now at all, even the Indians say their ponies cannot live here.

He had met and talked with Little Raven's [2 words underline] band of Araphoes, had started then Eastward again, seen them well into the Mountains and was about pushing on No. West to the Cheyennes and the rest of the Arapahoes, whose village's he was expecting to reach yesterday [underline].  He sent his courier in on his own trail via Chandler's old ranche [3 words underline] and had three wagons sent out to him, or to meet him on his return, by that route [3 words underline], which he seems to consider quite direct.

He says that bad off as we are we are far better off for mounts [underline] than our red brethren and that he could go anywhere and do anything with 100 men."},{"pageid":65557,"pagefilename":"73c475f5d2f0e53d33999ebdcee1558b.jpg","transcription":"In fact he says that if what he has seen is a fair specimen he would not be afraid to take a turn at the whole crowd with the fifty men he has with him, and furthermore he proposes to do it, unless they move in this way \"right smart\".

Sheridan that unless the Cheyennes and Arapahoes show the proper spirit now, we may look out for news of the biggest fight yet, and [strike] as he intends to clean out the whole institution.   There are about fifty lodges of Kiowas out there still who appear very independent and he says he thins he will have to give them a little tea party anyway before he comes in.\n\n    So much for Custer - a good deal of talk [underline] as usual but I reckon the exhibit of the weakness and poverty of the Indians is not much exaggerated.\n    It seems that the Cheyennes and Arapahoes had made no motion towards coming in, in fact had moved still farther off, until about the twentieth of January their Westernmost camp was attacked by troops from New Mexico, their people driven from the lodges, with a loss of 8 Arapahoes and 6 Cheyennes killed, and a large village destroyed.

It was then agreed to go on five miles to the branch of Cache Ck. half way between the old ranche and  the place where our old June trail intercepts the Cobb road.  Jones and I call the stream Apache Creek.   We went on and camped there, the Infantry not coming up I sent a man back and found that Mr. Colyer had lost two tires from the wheels of his [underline] wagon, disabling the party and necessitating a day's delay to get another wagon from here.   I consequently sent word that I could not wait, and breaking camp I went on that night to the spot on head of Cache CK. where we came out of the hills the 30th of last June.    There I spent Tuesday night.  Wednesday I went on past the enormous living spring I spoke to you about, only a mile from our June trail as we emerged from the hills, West of it, and across the main prong [2 words underlined] of Cache CK., which is still farther West - coming from the Valley pass we travelled in, and running N. W.\n\n[along side of page]   Alvord 1869-4-18      73 [circled}"},{"pageid":65572,"pagefilename":"bbcf83dd9f9157bba7938bf09b41a5b7.jpg","transcription":"as it emerges from the hills, thence curving North, No. East, East, and round past us here.  After crossing this we turned our course from West to No. West, and after six miles over high bare, dog town, gypsum prairie struck \"Stinking Creek.\"     You can smell the sulphur some distance before reaching the water.  The stream is evidently from unfailing springs which at the most remote points are sweet, (we crossed some of the spring branches in that Valley, June 30th) but become so strongly impregnated with Sulphur before the stream gets to be of any size that it may be considered as almost useless.\n\n    Beyond Stinking Creek we had a ride of ten miles across a most barren region, devoid of all interest and then reached Rainy Mountain Creek.   It rises around a single redish hill in the prairie not over 600 ft high, standing alone, rather at the N. W. corner of the Mts., and surrounded by considerable timber, Rainy Mt.- and the creek is circuitous and little else than a prairie drain, altho' a pretty good line of timber marks its course.    At the mouth of this stream, on the Washita we found the Yappariko Comanches, Old Ten Bean and Iron Mountain together, seventy-five or eighty lodges standing and nine packed up, the occupants evidently away.\n   Near this camp, before reaching it, we met Black Eagle Timbered Mt. and Kicking Bird of the Kiowas and learned from them that they were camped on a small stream still father"},{"pageid":65573,"pagefilename":"b262b33e9e5716368115abaadfc6837d.jpg","transcription":"N.

E. thro' the prairie entering the Washita at the \"big bend\", and there we spent Wednesday night.   \"Stumbling Bear\" was the only chief at home, the camp was of 32 lodges only, all the rest of the tribe \"backing\" Satanta & Lone Wolf.   \"Stumbling Bear\" accompanied us Thursday morning in search of Satanta and after ten miles of high, hilly prairie badly broken by red gullies, we f[ strike we and f] our course being North [underline], we found the Apaches and Satanta's camp of Kiowas on a small salty creek running crookedly, Easterly, into the Washita.  They were six on eight miles from it's mouth and Lone Wolf was camped at it's mouth.    All the men were out after buffalo, still high up the Washita, just on the Northern air [underline] line of the reservation, and I only saw a sub-chief of the Apaches.

E. from the mouth of Rainy Mt. Ck, the Yappa Chiefs being our guides at [strike] and bringing the last twenty miles right thro' the Northern part of the mountains, a very beautiful ride.    We saw the springs at the very head of Cache Ck, and the No. Fork of Medicine Bluff Creek.  We got in at sunset on Friday.\n    These facts we ascertained as to the country.\n    The Witchita Mountains can be crossed by horsemen in almost every direction at any time, and all thro' them are beautiful valleys and fine spring streams.   All the small streams at the head of the Cache Creek have fine living springs, fertile valleys and more or less wood.  It is a good country for Indians to occupy.   Stinking Ck will do [underline] if necessary, but the country beyond [underline] that is only fit for Buffalo ranges and hunting purpose, the soil is poor and the water salty.   Even on the Washita itself the valley cease to be fertile after getting about the mouth of Stinking Creek."},{"pageid":65575,"pagefilename":"b1f02c7c86c0c9fa8f63e3f537980d6b.jpg","transcription":"2.\n\n   Immediately upon my return I conferred at length with Major Kidd and Gen'l. Hazen, and it was decided that the Kiowas, Apaches and Yappa's were all too far out.   Satanta and Lone Wolf have at least two hundred lodges with them and [strike} Apaches and Kiowas, all fully fifty miles from here by the nearest route practicable for troops, and at any moment they wished to do so, could be over a hundred miles away without our being any the wiser.    Accordingly it wad decided to hold a general council yesterday, to arrange matters.   It took place at Gen'l. Hazen, that officer Major Kidd and myself being there, also Colonel Boone.    Of the Indians, the Peneteghkas, Noconees, Sapparikas, Apaches, Kiowas, Arapahoes and Cheyennes were represented by their chiefs the only prominent man who was absent being \"Lone Wolf\".   Satanta and Wolf Sleeve (Apache) got in yesterday morning and reported to Lone Wolf out hunting where word could not be got to him.\n   General Hazen stated that the Peneteghkas  & Noconees had selected their land according to agreement, that they had moved to their respective localities and commenced planting, but the Yappas, Apaches and Kiowas had not; that it was getting late in the season and now they [strike] he could not wait longer, so that tomorrow he would start himself with Col. Boone to select their lands for them."},{"pageid":65576,"pagefilename":"102d3134fb2a6066e782b30453db4508.jpg","transcription":"He told them that they were all too far off, and he should select spots on the head of Cache Creek for the Kiowas, on \"Apache\" Creek for the Apaches and on the Chandler's Creek for the Yapparikos.- that as soon as selected he should send me to the lands to plow and plant corn, and while the Indians themselves might stay out well up the Washita, hunting buffalo, they must [underline] at once send their herds of horses and most of their lodges to the country selected for them.\n\n    For you, I then told them that the road Gen'l. Hazen laid down for them was the right road and that they must follow it, that if they would do so at once they would have no trouble, but if they did not the soldiers would be sent out immediately to make [underline] them do it, and that if any [underline] of them went beyond the Washita or the Red River soldiers would at once [2 words underlined] be sent after them.\n    After much consultation among themselves Satanta replied that they would do as they were directed provided [underline] Gen'l. Hazen would do right to them, i.e. give them plenty of flour, coffee & sugar, as well as beef and meal, the rest of their goods and a supply of arms [underline] and ammunition.\n   Gen'l.

He told them that it was not optional with them what course to pursue, that the Great Father at Washington, thro' him, laid down the road for them to travel and unless they followed it at once without any \"if\" or \"ands\", soldiers would be sent to make them do it.    Satanta finally consented to go with Gen. Hazen today to select the ground and promised to soon send some of his people to the place.  The Apache chief promised as usual to do just what Satanta did.\n\n   Old Ten Bears however would not talk corn at all but talked \"Arkansas River\" until Gen. Hazen told him to dry up, he had heard enough from him.   We talked of arresting the old nuisance, his influence is very [underline] bad, but it could not be done when he was an invited guest at the council and we have not troops enough here now to take him from his own camp.\n   The matter of the departure of the Arapahoes and Cheyennes was then discussed in full, and Little Raven gave the Indians belonging down here a good talk, told them which was their country and which was his, and advised them to stay where they were not [strike] told as he would now do.\n   Tuesday next was the day fixed [underline] for the departure of the Cheyennes and Arapahoes, Little Raven says"},{"pageid":65578,"pagefilename":"a0de0333d1151809b7db8b18e76e0b53.jpg","transcription":"all [underline] the rest of the Arapahoes will be here then.

Gen'l. Hazen has gone today with Colonel Boone and Satanta to locate [underline] Kiowas and Apaches.     He took Capt. Rife and twenty cavalry men with him to stay up there 10 days which I consider a grand mistake as likely to give trouble, as we indirectly promised the Indians yesterday that soldiers would not [underline] be sent unless they failed to comply with their agreements.   I think the Indians will feel Rife and his party to a exhibition of suspicion of them, and that will be bad.\n   Three Noconees were caught [underline] night before last in the act of bringing in four horses from Texas, Essahavit first reported the, then Horseback met them and compelled them to give up the horses.  He brought in the horses yesterday morning but not the men.  I told Gen. Hazen he might never have so clear a case again and so good a parallel as the three Texans now here in chains for stealing Indian horse, and advised him to demand the Noconees, but he thought it inexpedient to do so."},{"pageid":65579,"pagefilename":"1e03c45562109dcffd8f3776890c04ea.jpg","transcription":"3.\n\n  Your confidential instructions from Gen'l.

Their status became then that of prisoners of war violating their parole which bound them to remain quietly here until the 20th instant then move with the Arapahoes to their reservation via Camp Supply, and there await the action of the Department or superior commander, in determining the terms of the acceptance of their surrender.

To prevent a general knowledge of the movement of troops that night Major Kidd avoided passing through the Indian camp by taking a rather circuitous route and did not get onto the trail of the Cheyennes until late on Tuesday, when every indication led to the belief that they had relieved themselves of the burden of lodge poles and similar baggage while traversing the mountains and broken up into small squads, their general course continuing Westward.   In that direction Major Kidd marched until Wednesday noon.  \n\n    I met the chiefs of the Arapahoes here on Tuesday, together with \"Little Robe\" and \"Bald Eagle\" of the Cheyennes, informed them of the movement of the column of troops, fully explained the object of it and received the assurance from all of them that no more of either tribe would leave no matter what might result, but that all remaining here were desirous of fulfilling their promise to move at once to their reservation.     Tuesday was the day which had been set for their departure but the scarcity of officers here had obliged Major Kidd to take with him Lt. Lee who had been designated to accompany the Indians to Camp Supply and consequently their final departure was postponed till Thursday, altho' they that day (Tuesday) moved out a short distance in the right direction.\n    At noon on Wednesday, 21st, Major Kidd halted with his command on Elk Creek, at the West end of the mountains, and sent out small reconnoitering parties while he grazed his animals.   One of these parties moving West about five miles came suddenly upon a herd of ponies and mules, just West of North Fork of Red River near the mouth of Elk Creek and approaching the Indians in charge, the latter fired upon the soldiers."},{"pageid":65594,"pagefilename":"552dcb1bd1a1ff01151d469199fabee5.jpg","transcription":"Receiving this report Major Kidd saddled and moved forward as rapidly as possible, found the herd gone but soon came in sight of an Indian village packed up and on the move.   The Indians has a start of eight or ten miles and abandoned everything there [strike] encumbering them in their flight.   Upon reaching the camp ground his guides and interpreter pronounced the Indians to be unquestionably Arapahoes and Major Kidd decided not to follow and attack because of the probability of the band being that of \"Spotted Wolf\" of the Arapahoes, who, when he started, were reported to be on Elk CK. en route to join \"Little Raven\" here.   He endeavored to communicate to the Indians his intention of being friendly and not disturbing their property but the condition of his horses rendered it impossible to overtake the fugitives.

It was, therefore, a Cheyenne band that fled at major Kidd's approach, and in all probability Red Moon's deserters were with it.\n\n    On Thursday the 22nd, the chiefs of the Arapahoes and Cheyennes here called in a body to bid farewell to General Hazen and your Headquarters, and the movement of their people to Camp Supply may be considered as fairly commenced that day.

I was treated with more consideration by General Sherman and his Aides than by all the rest put together and would advise any officer having important business to transact at headquarters to go direct in person to the General-in-Chief.\n    There is of course, a good deal of excitement among the line officers of the army, especially those unattached, as to what Congress will do this session.  Yesterday's Army & Navy Journal has a good editorial on the subject, and gives the Army Bills so far introduced, promising to continue attention to the subject.  It is impossible to tell yet what is to be done.     Among many officers in Washington watching the course of events I saw on Tuesday last, Gen. Davidson.  He was quite agitated and did not know whether he would seek retirement or go to the regiment, but I recon he will retire.\n    We have spent a very pleasant vacation since the middle of December, added to by the remarkably Spring-like weather which has been experience along the Atlantic Coast.  In Virginia we hardly needed fires either day or night, and in New England we find no snow, no ice in the streams and very little frost in the ground."},{"pageid":65632,"pagefilename":"b2d6544fbd1315ab94996803e4d5a5fe.jpg","transcription":"While in New York, I visited Vincent Colyer at his new office and studio there.

We earnestly ask you not to neglect this. \nOn the other hand, there are a number of things we can do for you.\n1. Furnish you leaflets for distribution. A few samples are enclosed.\n2. Furnish you with mite boxes or envelopes.\n3. Suggest plans for a Home Mission Bazaar which can easily be gotten up by the children.\nJoin hands with us in this partnership of effort and let us see what we can do for the kingdom of Christ in this nation.\nIf you are no longer superintendent, please hand this letter to you successor. May you have a year full of blessing in your Sunday-school.\nSincere;y yours,\nHubery C.

The entertainment is of a religious and thoroughly refined nature. The profits range from $10.00 to $100.00 or more.\nIn brief, this plan consists of an Exhibition of THE MASTERS' SERIES OF BIBLE PHOTOGRAVURES, making a splendid art exhibit, combined with a pleasant program, for which tickets will be sold by Sunday-School scholars at ten cents each, entitling the purchaser to admission to the Exhibition and also to possession of the one of the Photogravures.\nFrank L. Brown, Chairman of the Intermediate Department of the International Sunday-School Union, and Superintendent of the largest Sunday-School in the world, says of these photogravures: \"These pictures are gems of artistic work. They represent a distinct advance in Bible illustration, and should find wide use among Sunday-school workers. I have never seen any so choice.\"\nMarion Lawrence, General Secretary of the International Sunday-School Association writes: \"I have never seen their equal. Certainly you have hit upon a fine idea and I hope they will do much good and be much used. I shall be glad to recommend the pictures whenever I have opportunity to do so.\nTHE TRINITY ART EXHIBITION embodies an entertainment peculiarly appropriate for Churches and Church Organizations. It is held solely to promote the distribution of the Photogravures. Kindly mail us the enclosed post card at once and we will then write you describing the plan in much greater detail.\nYour prompt reply is necessary to secure this exhibition for your Church.\nSincerely yours,\nCURRENT LITERATURE PUBLISHING COMPANY.\nJames?

Y. \nDear Madam:\nWe have recently promoted to an office position, the man who has been looking after our interests in your section, and this leaves a vacancy in our selling force which we desire to fill immediately if we can find the right man and we believe you can help us.\nThere are just twenty towns included in that territory and the trade in these towns must be looked after by a man who is willing to work, and we are willing to start a man at fair wages with the distinct understanding that we will increase his pay as fast as the business from that territory will warrant.\nWe prefer to engage a man over 30 years old, of fair appearance, pleasing manner and one we can rely upon. We can't use any other sort of a man at any price.\nNow it seems to us that a man of your large acquaintance in that section might know just the man we want, and if you will hand him this letter and ask him to WRITE US ON THE BACK OF IT we will take the matter up with him and if we deem it advisable, will come on to see him personally.\nExperience in this line is not necessary as we can easily instruct a bright man in one day as to just what it required.\nTrusting that you can help us in our dilemma for which we shall be a thousand times obliged and thanking you for past favors, we are, \nYours fraternally, \nGLEN BROTHERS, INC.\nR.

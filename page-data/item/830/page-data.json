Generals Brooks and Miles noted but gave no criticism and the papers bore no endorsement from any of his QuiD.  As the Chief Surgn's endorsement seemed to disapprove not of new quarters but of new quarters on the plan suggested and as I differed from him materially I took the papers in to the SG and I found that he agreed with me that if a permanent barracks is to be built it would be more economical and insure better sanitary conditions as to heating etc. to get away from the pavilion style and so with his approval I took the report in for Captain Millers inspection -- he agreed with us and made a note of your suggestions in case it might be useful to him hereafter not necessarily in connection with Custer.  I mention this that your image and your work in this matter has not been thrown away or been without credit to you although it has brought no benefits to your part.

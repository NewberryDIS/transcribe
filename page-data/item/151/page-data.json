The enemy numbered about 320. To oppose this force there were only about 30 Free State men in the contest. The enemy had 2 cannons. Our men only their rifles and shot guns. North of the town is a unknown of timber? lining? the Marais des Cygnes? river. Among the underbrush in this timber commanding the entrance to the town from the west our men posted themselves.

I suppose Libby has written to you the neighborhood news of Mrs. Barnard's death, and two or three weeks before her Geo. Odenbaugh, at Mr. McLain's, and a few weeks before of Mrs. Anderson. I was at the last two funerals. They removed the unclear? from Mrs. Barnard's neck (as she had requested) before burial. Robert had seen her only three or four days before, and she seemed then well and cheerful.\nArthur Lessender is going to move west to about the center of the state to Lincoln county in a few weeks.

We are a sad household here today. Libbie had a little girl baby about three o'clock yesterday. She seemed to feel happy and cheerful after the event for a little while. But a complication set in - flooding, they called it - which the doctor (Dr Paul) could not control. She died at sundown. It is very sad. I was very much attached to her. She was a good friend to me - always ready and forward to help. Funeral Friday at the Congregational church. I do not think I had better try to come out.

Oct 20 1894\nMy dear sisters\nI am very sorry to hear by a letter from John Eddie that Mary is sick. I got a letter from him to day, and am writing from the P.O. The letter was written from Remsen. I am mistaken - It was returnable to Merrill if not delivered. I have been afraid that sister Mary would get sick with the worry. I believe it is harder on her than on Anna. I shall be very anxious to hear again. But I hope for the best. I am sorry there is so much there still to do. We are getting along pretty well here. It is hard on Mary Ann and her mother.

He told us also of a Wisconsin German \"Turner\" who was attacked by 8 or 10 marauders who demanded his horse and arms. He demurred and they fired on him.

Sept. 2, 1856.\nDear Father,\n\n  We wrote you 2 or three days ago about the burning of Osawatomie after a gallant but ineffectual defense. The Missourians made their appearance a little after daylight last Saturday morning. They shot F. Brown, about 11/2 miles west of town which was the first signal that they were upon us. The enemy numbered about 320. To oppose this force there were only about 30 Free State men in the contest. The enemy had 2 cannons. Our men only their rifles and shot guns. North of the town is a girt? of timber lining the Marais des Cygnes river. Among the underbrush in this timber commanding the entrance to the town from the west our men posted themselves. There they maintained the unequal contest for half an hour. The cannons were aimed too high. When our men saw the flash from these deep mouthed thunderers they stooped down and the murderous grape whistled and crashed in the leaves and branches overhead. But the disparity was too great. Our brave men were compelled to retreat across the river. Now was a perilous time. They had to cross the river and climb a steep bank right under the enemy's fire."},{"pageid":35182,"pagefilename":"a5dcd2aae2406777ae961a69bd0e4afc.jpg","transcription":"Some crossed at a narrow ford.

One man was at our house to day who had a bullet right through his hat, singing the top of his head. One noble friend of freedom was found in the river today, shot through the head. But the great majority, thank God, got across with their lives.  The unknown then returned and fired the town. So far as learned 2 of our men were killed in the action and 2 wounded - flesh wounds. There were also 2 killed and one severely wounded as they were coming in before the action. Two or three as yet missing - we hope they may yet be alive but fear they are in the river some at least. Our men estimate the loss of the enemy in killed and wounded as from 18 to 30. They took away three wagon loads of killed and wounded. \nSome families lost all they were worth in the world by the burning of the town. Others will suffer who are depending on their labor for support. I have related stern facts. I cannot moralize upon them. We have the man who was wounded most severely in our house. His thigh bone is broken. He has 20 or 30 shot and bullet wounds in his legs. Most of the shots went clear through.

We have had a very busy time here these last few days with our new building.  The cellar was completed yesterday. The frame will be put up in the beginning of the week.  We have had nine men at work here part of the time this week, - masons, carpenters, &c., besides our regular family. There are now two carpenters at work here, and a laborer whom we have hired for a month. My orchard is getting along pretty well, allowing for the unfarmable weather. The weather has been quite unfavorable for newly-planted trees, since they were planted. Some of them have leaved out nicely, others are just struggling into life, and some show no signs of life. I think I shall lose some trees. But I can \"try again.\" Some of my trees have blossomed. I do not mean to let them perfect any fruit this year. I shall break off either the blossom or the young fruit for the purpose of farming the growth of the trees. The trees in the old orchard have some blossom buds on them.  I think we shall have some fruit from them this year. The currant bushes hang gloriously full of blossoms. They evidently mean to make a show and create a decided sensation this summer. Our gardening is not very forward this summer. We have hardly touched the garden proper. I do not mean to have much of a garden of it. It's not good soil for a garden. Tomorrow (if it does not rain - we need rain) I am going to plant it with beans and perhaps potatoes.

So you see if we do not make much show in the garden outside of the current bushes, we shall be much better off for summer vegetables then if we were, say, in the Desert of Sahara.\nMiss Colegrove is with us yet. I hope she will stay with us sometime, but I am afraid she will not. I enjoy her company very much.  We had some exceedingly pleasant rides together before mother came home. Since then Miss C has not been as willing to ride with me. I believe mother got scared because the boys were pretty noisy once when we went out together. I think mother allows the boys to influence her feelings too much. I am afraid mother has been talking this over with Sarah, as she has with me, and wounded her delicacy. Don't you think mother too sensitive and particular? I shall feel bad enough with Miss Colegrove leaves. I think she has not concluded when she will leave.  She told me lately. (When I was urging her to stay here) that she did not know as she was any nearer going away now than when she first came here. At other times she talks as if she were going very soon.  She has promised to study Milton with me. I wish you had been able to give me a little better idea of your lessons. We intended to follow the same plan and take the same lessons. I am going to borrow Lewis's Milton. Miss C.'s health seems better than it has been since she has been here. \nWe had a letter from sister Sarah last night. She is continuing to improve.

Can you imagine what Sarah told me the sentiment of the apple blossom was? \"Alas that falsehood shall have such a goodly outside!\" What an abominable sentiment for so beautiful a blossom, and how malapropos! I felt really vexed, but I assured her that I had no idea what sentiment fools had attached to the apple blossom, and that whoever invented such a sentiment was a traitor to humanity, flowers, and orchards.

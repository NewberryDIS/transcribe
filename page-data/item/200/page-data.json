This being accomplished a truth was unlocked to man which he could use in securing all other necessary knowledge. Thus the Bible is the beginning of necessary knowledge but not the End of it.\nThe history of religious thought is another proof that the Bible is favorable to learning. \"All the great institutions of learning up to the present day have had their origin in Christianity.

The Bible then is not averse to Education. Religion and learning go hand in hand. They are Essentially one. A true Education covers both. Any acquaintance with God in his spiritual nature and in his works constitutes the \"Wisdom and knowledge\" which are prescribed to render stable the church of God.\nAnd here let it be observed that the truth of this scripture statement is confirmed in a Signal manner by the Element of permanence in the institutions of learning themselves. Humanly speaking no institutions of the world live like schools of higher learning. The colleges of Oxford and Cambridge have outlived the dynasties of Tudors and Stuarts. The Monarchy might perish forever, and these would flourish in immortal youth. Harvard and Yale, and Brown and Columbia, and Nassan Hall, and the University of Pennsylvania survived the Revolution, and Southern Colleges are the first to come forth from the Calamities of the Rebellion.\nSuch facts are suggestive and lead to the inquiry which we shall consider this morning.

The Education of Ministers is not enough. Mind must meet mind among the masses. Another recent utterance of one of our greatest religious teachers of this age is in joint. We may say what we will of the power of ore faith and piety in Every age, but cultivated intellect has always had an advantage over uncultivated.

No one who is careful in observing the signs of the times can fail to discover the attempt to amass the weight of scholarship on the side of infidelity. The opposers of religion grow bold when they can point to a scholar who says that the facts of science contradict the Bible.

So it has been chased through 18 Centuries and has been defeated each time upon its own ground. It is a simple thing to say that God will take care of his truth and his church. That is but begging the question at issue. We believe indeed that God will care for his truth and that in doing it he will use the means adapted to the End.

The fact is, we are fast out growing our facilities to educate and equip.\nLet it be understood, however, that we are not lacking in representative scholars.

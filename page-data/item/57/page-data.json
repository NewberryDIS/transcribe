Soon I heard a rustling at my door and a little maiden entered. She was exceedingly beautiful and her smile riveted my attention. There was meaning in that smile, so cheerful yet so full of pity?, I felt, though she was but a child, that I was in the presense of a [superior] being. Perceiving my enquiring look, she said, \"my name is Sympathy, I have come to dispel your gloom and show you that Benevolence is not without her votaries?, follow me.\" I obeyed, impelled by a power which I could not resist. Swiftly we passed over many hills and vales, through shady groves and across sunny lakes, how, I could not tell, for we seemed not to walk, and now we approached a broad, quiet river. Its waters clear as crystal plainly revealed the pure? surface of its pebbled bed. On its banks blossomed flowers of the richest hue and variegated unclear, each seeming to vie with the others in emitting the sweetest fragrance. My little guide directed me to enter this stream, for there was"},{"pageid":17789,"pagefilename":"7c6cfb56628cc6d7ada36f59380adc6f.jpg","transcription":"no other way to reach the country we sought. Scarcely had I touched the limpid waters before whole soul was filled with heavenly extacy. I felt an affection for every body, even my enemies were transformed into friends and I forgot all bitter thoughts. Amazed I asked the unclear of this. \"This,\" replied Sympathy, is the river of forgiveness, its  waters flow around our country that all who enter may pass through and be washed from all unkindness. That land which we are now approaching is the island of Love and Benevolence is our queen. Delighted I quickened my pace and soon we stepped on the opposite shore. Beautiful beyond description was this isle. Nature seemed to have chosen this favorite retreat and made it her Eden. No lovely lanscape had I ever seen but a sweet model existed here. Mute with wonder I scarcely moved, and my gentle guide entering into all my rapture gazed upon my face with unclear eyes. Her soul lived not in solitude, but delighted to mingle with others. Were any happy, she rejoiced more than though hers was the good obtained; did any mourn, she loved to weep with them. There were many people gathered in the umbrageous groves that studded the isle. All happy in their various ways, seemed particularly to rejoice when they did their neighbor a favor. I was amazed to find no beggars, none destitute of life's comforts and necessaries, neither were there any who reveled in their abundance. I turned to Sympathy to learn the reason of this and she bid me enter the next grove. It was larger than those surrounding and seemed even more verdant. The trees were filled with merry songsters and the green carpet was thickly set with flowers. In the center of this wood was a unclear throne decked by Nature's lavish hand. A maiden of rare beauty sat upon it. In her eye shone love every one, and her smile would"},{"pageid":17790,"pagefilename":"b0026210d8ddc99e4d061f9f2e224145.jpg","transcription":"have adorned an angel's face.

Here she was interrupted by the approach of some of her most faithful subjects. Their countenances were filled with alarm as they told her that a great enemy had come into their country and many of the people had joined themselves to him. He came, they said, laden with gold and silver and told all he met that if they would but follow his example they soon should ? such riches. Many simple ones' believing these promises hastened to search for treasures and his direction. Benevolence with sad countenance rose and sought the ? of this desolation. We found thousands eagerly following the stranger. Their queen, whom till now they had loved so well, entreated them to stay and not rush madly into misery but they heeded not her voice so infatuated were they with thought of golden gains. No longer did they ? that happiness? union so lately theirs, but envious lest there should gain ? rewards than themselves they cared not who they might injure if only they could get nearer their new sovereign. This king now a stern man who cared not for the happiness of his subjects, but only that they might increase his power and glory.

Angry words passed between those who now first knew what it was to hate. When they reached the other side of the bridge they did not remain together but each wondered alone desirous that none should share what treasure they might find. There were many Inhabitants of this unhappy land but not one contented person could I find. Some were in posession? of great riches which served only to increase their misery, for they constantly feared to lose it. Others thirsting for pleasure squandered their wealth in intemperate? living which only brought disatisfaction? and disease. Others, were in extreme poverty and vainly sought aid of their more fortunate companions. I asked one of these wretched creatures why he did not apply for assistance to their king.

Perhaps you have no heard of the seriousness? that has been at this station, if you have not it would not doubt, be interesting to hear of it. There has been much more feeling at this place upon the subject of religion since you left us. Many have felt the need of a Saviour. We were afraid it was decreasing and I do not think there is so much feeling in the school but we are more encouraged about the neighbours. We have great reason to praise the Lord for His goodness and for His wonderful works to the children of men. We lately received a letter from Mr. Holland which informs us that the Lord is carrying on His work there. They hope four are born again and many inquiring what they should do to be saved. he says there are six different places that he holds meetings besides the Sabbath.

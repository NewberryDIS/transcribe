Jones June 4, 1907\nRemsen, N.Y. June 4, 1907\nRev & Mrs. J.V. Jones,\nMy Dear Friends:\nIn justice to myself, to the memory and strict teaching of my wise and faithful mother, as well as to yourselves, it seems to me that an explanation should be given, in regard to the moving of the gooseberry bushes, which I fear has given additional offence, as I can think of no other cause. A little more than  year ago, when you and I, Candace, were together viewing our little Estates here, you requested me to move my gooseberry bushes, giving a reason, that they were trespassing on your land. AS the bushes were in bud, or in bloom, at the time, we decided together to leave them, for"},{"pageid":29623,"pagefilename":"ec32543526ce4ffc15927108779d8363.jpg","transcription":"2\nthe time being, in hope of some fruit during the summer, but I kept it in mind, from that time, and during the winter, to move them as soon as the spring should come. I was twice disappointed in my help this spring, so that my chance for attending to this matter, was delayed till the buds had again come, but on the first day that my help comes, I had him move the buses, even at the risk of serious injury to them and the almost certainty of destroying my chance of fruit for this season. This was on the day you returned from Penymynydd. I went over to Whitfield Jones to borrow his crowbar, in order to see where the line should be, (saying nothing of course, of the use to be made of it,) and by placing it in line, found that the largest bush, on the north end of the row, was really trespassing on your land. I then decided to divide the root, leaving what was on your land for you to place where you chose,"},{"pageid":29624,"pagefilename":"25705ed9522ce2f3ad4ed2237c89d1e2.jpg","transcription":"(3.)\nand then move the other part entirely out of your way. But Mr. Mortise did not seem able to make that arrangement, and swing it over into the roe were the others were to be placed. Although I wished and intended to leave a party on your land, I did not feel condemned for moving it entire, as I did not suppose you considered it yours. When we first came here, Mary Evans explained to me that that row of gooseberries was ours, and the currants and raspberries theirs, and to that arrangement we were both loyal, also those who came after them. It thus had always seemed to me that they were ours without a question and that this particular bush was consequently to be moved with the rest. It has now occurred to me that possibly you may have not remembered your request of last spring 1906, for removal, and that you had perhaps considered that part of the bush which was really trespassing on your land, as yours. If you had this view"},{"pageid":29625,"pagefilename":"ead30e1291b64aaefa05eacf919624a8.jpg","transcription":"(4.)\nof the case, it must have seemed strange to you to have me move it entire onto my land. If it appears to you in that light, I would be glad to make amends, either for youto take it entire, or for me to pay you for the part that was on your land. The question, so far as I am concerned, is not whether you needed or cared for the bush, as you said you had plenty, and did not care for it, but whether your request last spring justified me in removing it out of your way. No one is willing to be imposed upon even to the amount of a fine, and I would be very loth to subject you to such a trial, Mother used to tell us a saying of Dr. Watts' \"He that would steal a pig, would steal a greater thing,\" and I was so strictly taught in this matter, that I could no sooner take an apple from under another's tree without permission, (except in case of suffering, as the deciples in the corn) than I would take the entire tree.

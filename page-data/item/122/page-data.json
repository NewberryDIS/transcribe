How are the taxes in Topeka. Brother John's were very high. But perhaps ministers are not taxed. They are not here. Father was exempt, but as soon as he was gone, Mother was assessed. It seemed hard in her old age and bereavement, but such was the law. Does one become responsible for taxes as soon as the first payment is made? Then repairs are to be considered. In buying a house one wants to be sure that much of that would not be called for right away. We had to commence shingling the first day after entering, and the expense of repairing has been very great. If you buy, look sharp to the condition of the premises. Is the cellar damp or dry?

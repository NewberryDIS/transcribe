Last summer when I came to La Porte I ran down but when I returned to you I immediately commenced gaining.  Do you remember how fast I gained after I returned home to your last fall.  My sleep refreshes me much more when you are by my side than when I sleep alone.  Do you remember how your rubbing me last fall, when I suffered so from  my fall, relieved me instantly of all pain.  When I came here this winter I wa almost free from nervousness compared with what I have suffered from it since you have been gone.  How often when I have been suffering from extreme nervousness this winter have I felt that I would give almost anything to have the soothing influence of your physical presence.  Josephine was a dear good wife but her physical presence had no such effect upon me.  Our physical natures must be almost perfectly adapted to each other & may it not be that our souls are also.

I had looked upon the marriage relations as a partnership where two loving hearts put in all they had & commenced life together not where their parents left off, but where their united means enabled them to commence remembering that their childhood home cost their parents long years of toil, & if they would leave an equally pleasant home for their children they must do the same, unless their parents had been so precuriary blessed as to leave them a home ready made.  Neither your parents nor mine were thus fortunate.  We were married.

If we have comfortable health I think our farm will support us.  I have just called on Charles & Ellen.  They were feeling unpleasantly about their housekeeping arrangements.  I think they have had unpleasant thoughts towards each other if nothing else.  Charles & Ellen with Ellens wishes as I understand decided to board at the Hotel.  In a few days Ellen got sick of it & wanted to keep house.  I advised Charles not to commence keeping house till he had decided what to do for if he did not remain in La Porte it would make it bad for him..  The next time I saw Charles he had hired a small house which Ellen seemed pleasant with & they went to work to get ready to keep house.  Charles & Ellen thought the back kitchen would not do so Charles decided to haul it down & rebuild which well cost him some 15 or 20 dollars. He paid his rent out month in advance.  He got his lumber & nails & he & the carpenter had commenced & hauled down the old kitchen & were putting up the new.  He also got a man to whitewash the house.  Now Ellen has heard of another house which she likes better & is perfectly disgusted with the first house.  Charles don't know what to do.  She tells him she is homesick etc.  I don't know how it will come out.  I greatly fear for him for as I understand he is nearing a point where his funds will be exhausted.  I wish you & Mary would write him a good cheerful letter.  He says he has been looking for letters from you for a long time.  Don't on any account hint anything I have said.  It will only make matters worse.  I should not have written what I have only you wrote me something relative to them in your last.  Charles seems to think he has done all in his power & it is pretty hard not to have his wife satisfied.  Be sure & not start to Lawrence alone & don't on any act. let the baby take cold. Don't start unless the weather is pleasant.  I insist on this.  Be careful & not so bundle the \n(along the side)\nbaby face as to keep him from getting a plenty of fresh air.  He needs fresh air to breathe& you must not take him out unless the weather is fine & pleasant so that he willl take cold I have heard of children being sometimes by covering their faces too closely."},{"pageid":40077,"pagefilename":"92dc67ace1e5ebc0a039584a0a48d9f2.jpg","transcription":"La Porte Ind.

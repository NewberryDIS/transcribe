From the present aspect of affairs I judge that it will be by all deemed necessary to have the Agency and the military post situated near together, if they do no even soo become one and the same thing.        General Sheridan and General Hazen seem to agree that the two must near one another, and in the selection of the locality, the former wishes in the establishment of the post, to accommodate the Indian interests, while the latter desires to locate the Agency so as not to incommode the troops.    Both rather seem to incline to the Valley of the Washita River Valley [strike].  I regret this as [strike] and feel certain that they would change their minds were they to examine the country as carefully as I have done.     I spent several weeks last summer in visiting the [strike] all parts of the Comanche and Kiowa Reserve except the uninviting North Western portion, with a view to intelligently deciding upon the best point for the new post, having the Indian question my own [strike] mind at the same time.

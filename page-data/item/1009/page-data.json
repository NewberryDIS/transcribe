From the present aspect of affairs I judge that it will be by all deemed necessary to have the Agency and the military post situated near together, if they do no even soo become one and the same thing.        General Sheridan and General Hazen seem to agree that the two must near one another, and in the selection of the locality, the former wishes in the establishment of the post, to accommodate the Indian interests, while the latter desires to locate the Agency so as not to incommode the troops.

I used this language in my official report dated July 14, 1868, forwarded to Department Head Quarters after my careful examination of this whole section of country:\n    \" I am decidedly of the opinion that for the purpose of controlling the Indian tribes inclined to be lawless and troublesome, of preventing the marauding parties now so often visiting North Western Texas, and of protecting the Chickasaw and Seminole borders, and the peaceable tribes still farther West, who are endeavoring to fulfill their obligations to the government from molestation by the wild bands, a new post, to be garrisoned by cavalry, should be at once established West of Fort Arbuckle * * * I gave particular attention to the selection of the best location for such a station * * * At a point eight (8) miles North and seventy (70) miles West from Fort Arbuckle the most practicable route being about seventy-five (75) miles.

The Northern boundary of the plateau is a beautiful, pure stream of good size running in a deep pebbly bed from springs in the mountains North and West of Mount Scott, just a the foot of the cliff mentioned and called Medicine Bluff Creek.   In passing the plateau, the stream joins the main Cache Creek and that there flows at the North-east and East sides there being between the high ground and the Creek at the East, a meadow of two or three hundred acres fully thirty feet lower but dry, never overflowed and of remarkable fertility.

General Sheridan and General Hazen seem to agree that the two must near one another, and in the selection of the locality, the former wishes in the establishment of the post, to accommodate the Indian interests, while the latter desires to locate the Agency so as not to incommode the troops.

So confident do I feel that time will prove every interest of the government to be best conserved by the selection of that locality for the establishment of both Agency and Post, that I venture to give you my reasons for this belief.\n    Looking first to the selection of a point for building a frontier post for purely military purposes.  I used this language in my official report dated July 14, 1868, forwarded to Department Head Quarters after my careful examination of this whole section of country:\n    \" I am decidedly of the opinion that for the purpose of controlling the Indian tribes inclined to be lawless and troublesome, of preventing the marauding parties now so often visiting North Western Texas, and of protecting the Chickasaw and Seminole borders, and the peaceable tribes still farther West, who are endeavoring to fulfill their obligations to the government from molestation by the wild bands, a new post, to be garrisoned by cavalry, should be at once established West of Fort Arbuckle * * * I gave particular attention to the selection of the best location for such a station * * * At a point eight (8) miles North and seventy (70) miles West from Fort Arbuckle the most practicable route being about seventy-five (75) miles.

The Northern boundary of the plateau is a beautiful, pure stream of good size running in a deep pebbly bed from springs in the mountains North and West of Mount Scott, just a the foot of the cliff mentioned and called Medicine Bluff Creek.   In passing the plateau, the stream joins the main Cache Creek and that there flows at the North-east and East sides there being between the high ground and the Creek at the East, a meadow of two or three hundred acres fully thirty feet lower but dry, never overflowed and of remarkable fertility.

It might be necessary on account of the length of the route and to look out for the Indians in the neighborhood of the Salt Plains, to have a post in the Territory near the Southern line of Kansas.

In my opinion this point is of great importance to the Indians for I believe the Comanches and Kiowas will become successful, prosperous stock raisers long before they will cultivate the soil to any extent. Even now the Indians who care more for their horses are herding them in the valley at the Eastern end of the Witchita Mts. In the connection, when it is remembered that the garrison of the Post to be established will be mainly cavalry, the fact should not be overlooked that when proposals were invited the time of October for contracts for hay for the company of cavalry ordered to this point (Ft. Cobb) to serve with General unclear each of these persons who examined the country with a view to putting in bids decided that hay could not be cut to any advantage in the Washita Valley - not at any place near to this point than the junction of Medicine Bluff Creek and Cache Creek.\nBy some it is thought that the mountain region will be a locality tending to facilitate raids into Texas by the Indians placed there, but to me it seems that the very establishment of their families so far South will prevent the Indians from endangering them by expeditions to Texas which would bring troops to their own camps."},{"pageid":66636,"pagefilename":"0f3e09951992af3a7d9a6bb53913810e.jpg","transcription":"There seems to be more ground for fearing trouble to arise into the union of the Indians of the Cheyennes & Arapahoe Reserve with those of the Comanche and Kiowa Reserve than from any other source, and I judge the true policy to be to keep the two well separated rather than by inviting and encouraging the latter to cross their Northern boundary which would practically be done by the establishment of their Agency upon the Washita.\nThis distance from the best depot on the railroad, say Fort Riley, to this position I recommend would be not over twenty miles farther than to the best point which can be found for a Post upon the Washita, while the Texas market, which must supply the greater portion of the grains, meal? etc. which will for several years be required for the Indians as well as the troops, will be that much nearer."},{"pageid":66637,"pagefilename":"06f4e340b7e5d445fe248663753e1ceb.jpg","transcription":"You see how strong my belief is that the position I describe is the most expedient from all points of view, for the location of the Agency and the Post.

I believe much of this trouble could have been avoided by the establishment of the Post last summer of Fall as I recommended in July - and that the matter should not now be delayed until the spring rains which will postpone all work until May or June - if not begun before they commense. From what the Comanche chiefs said to General Sheridan the other day - you can see how they feel about this.\nGeneral unclear seemed to think when he first arrived that you intended him to remain at this particular spot (nor even on the Reserve of any tribe) or very near here, expended considerable labor and some money in settling himself here and while from later letters from you he feels at liberty to select any point for a permanent establishment which he may deem more suitable.

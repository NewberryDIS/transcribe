The Trustees have done nothing. Brother Eaton has done a little, but has been confined to the House most of the time. I thought you was a Man of your word, till I got your last letter. You stated that you would not come here without a salary of $100. I had told the Trustees so and they would have given it. But it appears that you accepted the offer of the School without a Salary.

I have not time to give you any advice as to your future course. I was in hopes that you would have wisdom sufficient  about you to come out here before I left that I might give you the result of my Experience, but as you have done differently I do not see but that you wish grope your way in dark as I have done. In reference to a Music Teacher, all that I can tell you is that Miss Franks will not do. the People will not send their scholars to her. Miss Cicel? might give the Lessons--but you then loose the tuition, & also would loose the Music Class from the School. I must confess that I don't admire your arrangement for Teachers. The Primary Department I would cut loose from The School --it now amts to nothing since Helen left it, it cost me more than $100 out of Pocket--in fact it has doe nothing since Josephine Stedman had it She broke it up--and I believe she will break up any School. However much you may think of her as a woman, don't be so foolish as to think that hence, she is a good Teacher. And again I hope she will Treat you differently from which she has me--her bills for her School amounted to about $70 dolls. I took them and gave her sixty-six dolls for them--twenty-five dolls of them I shall never get a cent of $ for collecting most of the rest it has cost me 10 per cent. While she was teaching she was in School and for this I charged her only half price. When she left here I gave her $20, I know I overpaid her, but could not stop to go down to the house and get the Books, and see--it has run along till now and she has not been"},{"pageid":40803,"pagefilename":"8a7950077441a95e7ef62677577fe3d1.jpg","transcription":"here since when I made my bills out. I made out hers and there was $10 or between good 10 due me from her --but if she took her old bills as she ought and pay me which I paid her for them she would owe me more than fifty dolls. I could present one to a person who will not say they won't pay it, for she did not learn them anything--and they are a class of People whom it will no good to sue, for you can't make anything off them --some of them I have compromised with and others who they would pay --shall try and do so with all. But after doing by her as I did I make out her bill as I would any book, else and sent it to her and she says she won't pay. I have overcharged her and have got more than my fifty now. I never believed there was a woman on Earth who would be small enough to rise me as she has, and that too for less than ten dolls--it takes but a few cents to buy some folks and I find more and more of them every day. Now I don't care how deep you are in with her, I just ask you to keep your eyes open--and for your school's so he don't have her one of your Teachers if you wish to get along. Again, I am told Sarah is only going to stay one year--if so, it is the worst arrangement you could possibly make, to have her come at all--for when she leaves your Female Department will be down for a year--if you had consulted me about Teachers, I know you would have been better off--if you had got a good man or woman besides Sarah, and better a woman, who could teach Music and the other Teachers? and start afresh you, you would make $500 bg? the bargain whereas now if you don't loose that amount I am mistaken. But do the best you can. I shall talk with Bro Bartlett the minister here and he can tell you--it is too long to write. I intended to send Sarah fifty dolls but I have such work settling and so many disputing bills and deductions to make that I shan't have enough to get us out of Town  even after settling the Piano. Do you make it an invariable rule that ever person rich or poor, big or little male or female who enters the school shall pay you for the time they enter before you received them as students--let them squirm as much as they please--do it--it will be hundreds of Dolls in your pocket. I will put advertisements into the Paper. I shall leave here the Sixth or 9th inst.--and will pay Sarah as soon as possible. We had a grand Exercise--better than ever before. There has been no sickness in town till within a week or two--there is some flux now and a little Cholera--most of it, if not all, occasioned by imprudence in eating--two cases yesterday died in a few hours. I think your prospects tolerable fair. Shall leave my things for you to ship when the water rises in the fall--and whatever business I have for you to do I will leave with J. Holden Jr.  We are all well save Abby and I am afraid that she has a cough that will carry her off before a great while unless we can do something for it. We have done everything that we can think but have not affected it. Perhaps a change of climate will help her.Sarah has stood like iron. She never even had the summer complaint last summer nor has not this so far and hope they will so continue.  Miss Woodbury is well. Keep your eye peeled when you come here--for you will find any quantity of wolves dressed up in sheep's clothing and if opportunity offers they will threw off the fleece and show the hair and teeth--look out for them--Direct your next to Galesburg Knox Co.

Yet you are making more there than I ever did, notwithstanding the Trustees said I was making money.

Suppose shall not be employed more than half of the time each day during the summer in the Academy; shall improve the rest in studying, drawing, painting etc. Shall spend part of the vacation with brother Raymond at Norwich; and a young lady residing in town about three miles from here who has been attending school here this spring has invited me to spend a few days with her. Raymond and Gleason were here a fortnight since - thought it strange that you should go to Townshend. Raymond wishes you to write him. Had a letter from home about the time you left - so I can tell you nothing that will be new in regard to things there. Mr. Marshall goes to New York during vacation. I must tell you how we spent the first day of May. In the morning we were occupied in school, in the afternoon we had a walk and the evening the young ladies and gentlemen spent with me at my boarding place The refreshments consisted of various kinds of nuts, raisins and apples. One of the ladies crowned me \"queen of May.\" We had a very happy time. I had fear when I came here last fall that I should not remain so long or succeed as well. I feel that a great responsibility is resting upon me and that I am young to occupy such a station, but I try to do well and conduct myself so that my influence shall be good and trust I succeed in some degree. I understand that Miss Woodbury is coming here to school this summer; shall be glad to see her. Miss Barber from Wardsboro, VT has been here this spring and intends staying through the two next terms. I attended school with her at Swansey - I think there will be quite a number from Swansey way here this fall. Write soon. Your ever loving Sister Sarah J.

I Suppose you and Lydia each have received a letter from us since you wrote last.- Think  you can say you have heard from us as often as practicable since we have left home this time. I love to write home and love to receive letters from there and hope you and Sister will write us as often as possible. Am expecting to hear from here and Lucy Miller soon. Nathan is also expecting a letter from Edwin every day. We hear from Erasmus and Raymond too; they both write as though they were in good spirits. In regard to what you wrote about the proposals Raymond made you I want you to do what you think will make you happiest and be the best for you. I know Sister Abby is good and sincere in what she has written to you upon the subject and that she would do all she could to make you happy but I do not think Raymond is able now to take upon himself (I do not know to be sire how he stands in the world in regard to his pecuniary matters) what he proposes to you and I know your feelings too well to think you would feel as independent there as you would to live by yourself and the difference existing between your religious views and theirs and being so far from the scenes and place of your past life might be sources of unhappiness to you, but you must weigh the subject - deeply and act as you think best. I think it would be best for Jesse perhaps to go and live with Brothers K?__ for then he would have some one to watch over him and do all they could for him; as for Myron Nathan and myself will look after him. I do not intend staying this way any longer than duty seems to"},{"pageid":40905,"pagefilename":"29de0442cb9b37ac4d4afdeeef2ae6ec.jpg","transcription":"Sarah\nrequire, for living here is not congenial with my feelings and never has been and I cannot think of doing it any great length of time. If I live, shall return to New England in two years at most from this time with the intention of staying there and think if you conclude to remain there you had better stay where you are if Mr. Miller will rent the house to you until one or both of us return and keep Myron with you and watch over him and bring him up the best you can. Will send you soon money to pay his tuition this fall and to get him books for the Winter if he needs any. Wish him to pay close attention to ciphering, writing and spelling and be a good boy in all things - tell him so from me. If at any time you should need any money don't be afraid to let me know it -for if I am well I shall have it to spare you. Intend on my return establishing a school somewhere myself and should like Sister's cooperation unless she wishes to go and stay with Raymond or should be married in the meantime. After receiving a letter from her shall write her all about these things. Hope to write to David and Jesse soon; suppose they hear from us through you and you must always write us about them. Should think cousin Sarah would write me a she did not know where she should be this fall when I left. Hope I shall get time to write to Roeana, Mrs. Stone and other relatives and friends before long. You must remember me to all friends in Phillipston. Give my love to Mr. Miller & family - how much I should like to see them all. How much I would give to enjoy the privilege of visiting the burying ground in P__ to night and coming to see you and finding sister there. The Miniatures we took with us are a great satisfaction to us but I will write no more this time. Affectionately Sarah [later Weaver]\n[left-hand side] Monday night= Oc 16th Have received a letter today from Cousin Sarah and it was such a cousinly one that it has done me much good. Nathan had one from Raymond too- he goes to Marietta 2nd of this month."}],"title":"Nathan Kendall and Abby J. Reed Kendall letters, 1842-1907"}}}

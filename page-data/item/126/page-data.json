At home, in the midst of loved ones, is no place to know the full value of letters. Did I not put full confidence in your love, I should fear you would tire of writing so often.

Yours recieved last eve. Am very sorry you have been so anxious I have done wrong in not writing I will see what the Dr. says and write again. I do not think father need feel uneasy about paying the bill here. Dr. Holland has promised to wait and when he once gives his word he stands by it. He would not think of pressing for payment in these hard times. When I get well Pa I can soon make a return. I am doing so very well.

We have had a great time this week, starting home. Packed Monday, was too tired to go Tuesday, Wednesday it rained. E. was not willing for me to start today and so it is. I do want to see you Ma, so much. I fear from your letter that you are quite feeble.

I think when I go, I shall go through Rutland, as that is the most quiet route. I shall thus pass through Saratoga. Shall stop in Rutland over night, and reach Utica I think early in the afternoon of the next day. Father will be going next week and I shall thus lose seeing him before he starts. It cost me quite a struggle to bring my mind to this, but perhaps it is best so. I do not think my health is quite as good as when we came out, but hope after getting home, and resting, that I may realize that the visit has been beneficial. Elizabeth would like much to go home with me and make us a good long visit, but they have"}],"title":"Mary Holywell Everett letters, 1850-1891"}}}

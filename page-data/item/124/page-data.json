All you have to do is, after stracthing? away till you see some serum & perhaps a wee little blood, & hold the point on a few minutes, the edge & then the back.  Let it dry before covering, & that is all.  I was vaccinated once this winter & it did not take & tonight I made another trial.  I do not believe in using vaccine even one remove from the cow.

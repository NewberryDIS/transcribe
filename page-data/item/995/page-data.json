Having perhaps the same foolish views \nof the rest of the young men of our place, I , determined \nto make one of the crowd bound for the new Eldorado \nof the west. Accordingly we raised a party consisting \nof seven persons, bought arms and equipments and\nembarked on our long and tedious journey. We started \non the Burlington and Quincy Rail Road running \nthrough the centre of the state the most fertile and \nbest settled part, and let me here remark, that on\nthis line is by far the best land in the west at the time.\nI traveled through there they had a most spendid harvest\nthe grain was as full and yellow and as I afterwards was \ninformed so vast was the crops that they could not ship \nit and were compelled to make fuel of it. On the following \nmorning we arrived at Quincy on the Mississippi River one\nof the most ancient towns in Illinois.

It was indeed a beautiful scene and one that I shall never forget the great father f water was clothed in all its splendor and granduer.  On the following morning we embarked on its broad boosom on board the steamer Pike, a splendid specimen of a Mississippi River boat large as the huge leviatians that plow furrows in the broad Atlantic her cabins a magnificent palace altogether one of those boats can compare favorably with the floating craft of any country.  And now all being ready we steamed up the noble river passing? by fairy looking islands that it would not take a great stretch of the imagination to suppose they were inhabited by the spirits of the red men who lived for ages on its shores.  Passing by rapidly all these scenes the steamer suddenly rounded to came up to the leevee and we were at the landing of the City of Hanibal,  Missouri.  We disembarked and proceeded to view the town & we found it to be a nicely situated town containing about four thousand inhabitants.  It is situated on the river bottoms parallel with the river and between its banks and the bluffs which are here many hundred feet in height.  The city has an appearance of buisiness there are a number of quite respectable looking stores which seem to be doing quite a thriving buisiness.  Here I first seen slavery there are a few niggers in the city its proximity to the Illinois shore prevents the holding of slaves to any great extent.  We stopped in this town only a very short time and once more started on the iron horse bound for the far off shores of the Missouri.  I must here make some remarks about the interior of Missouri it is a splendid looking farming country yet? between Hanibal? and St Joe about two hundred and fifty miles"},{"pageid":64601,"pagefilename":"5582e3583b24dab231313470089d299f.jpg","transcription":"3\nthere is scarcely the sign of a well cultivated farm you will think this very strange that people should pass such fine land so near a market, and go and locate in such out of the way places, as Kansas and Nebraska, but the reason is simple it is becausb it is a slave state. If northern man cannot go there and take a farm because they are averse to holding slaves and if he works his farm himself he is looked upon with scorn by his neighbor who works his farm by slaves he is constantly taunted with being from white trash and it annoys him so that he leaves in disgust and moves to some country where honest labor is not looked upon as a disgrace by the nabobs of the South. This is the only reason why this beautiful and fertile state is only settled along the river shores slavery is not a paying institution there consequently there is no danger of its spreading north as many of our northern people are afraid of, nature has erected barriers against slavery more potent than any that could be enacted by Congress, as soon as slavery is abolished in Missouri then will she take her stand along with her sister states the richest and proudest of all. One days ride on the railroad brought us clear across the state of Missouri into the city of St Joe the furthest northwestern city of the United States, it is situated on the banks of the river partly on the bottoms and partly on the bluffs. One would be surprised at finding such a large fine looking city away so far from civilization it has a compact well built and substantial appearence many of its buildings would compare favorably with the finest of our own great city, the Paytee House is as large at the Fremont House it is situated on the outskirts of the city on slightly elevated ground commanding a beautiful view of the Missouri river, from this house the Pony Express starts for California.

It was indeed a grand idea the interchange of news across the continent in such a short time almost equal to Rail Road speed the distance being about twenty hundred miles, over mountains and through deserts. We stopped in St Joseph about four days and then concluded it was time to proceed on our long journey. We went down to the Missouri river, and took passage on board of a ferry boat for Belmont, a village on the Kansas side about five miles from St Joe. The Missouri river here is about four hundred yards wide, the water is very yellow being a mixture of about one half part of sand and water, it has a very rapid current running at the rate of about ten miles an hour. In some places it is very deep but the sand bars are all movable which makes it very dangerous to navigation.

Each one made himself useful providing the evening meal or attending to the horses. some made a fire, some worked at putting up the tent and made a bed of blankets and quilts on the bare ground and others cutting ham making coffee and providing the other articles belonging to the prairie travelers life, The supper was delicious and sharpened as our appetites were by vigorous exercise and a strange climate we enjoyed the meal hugely, Ye epicures and good livers you should come out on the prairie shove a wagon up a hill about seven hundred feet high and you could appreciate a harty healthy meal without fearing any of the pangs of indigestion or dyspepsia After suppers we chatted a while, and then turned under our blankets for a nights rest, and I must say I never rested better in my life I slept soundly all night and woke in the morning thoroughly refreshed our first and nights experience on the prairie did not have many hardships. We turned out at the first strak of day and then had a very busy time till we got started, some brought in the horses cleaned and harnessed them others pulled up our tent and packed it and the bed cloths into the wagons, and others were busy preparing the breakfast. At sunrise we were all ready and started across the bluffs directly westward through the plains of Kansas, the road today lay through a very rough rolling country the hills being about two hundred feet high, no sooner on the top of one expecting then to find a good road, but instead we could look down a tremendous steep hill so very abrupt that we were compelled to chain two of the wheels of the wagon to"},{"pageid":64604,"pagefilename":"176543414ea0a98dd0d6f3cf9ea6d168.jpg","transcription":"6\nprevent it from running into the horses. The scenery through this place was very fine the grass was luxurient and green on one side and boundless as the ocean, on the other lay a thick belt of timber which enclosed the Missouri river. The road was thickly strewed with imigrants far as the eye could reach over the rooling hills all rushing on eagerly bound for the same golden country, On account of the rough nature of the roads we made only twenty miles this day and camped at sunset within a few rods of a Kansas farmers house, we purchased from them some warm biscuits and fresh milk and had a supper fit for a king. In the evening the farmer invited us to his house he there was to be a singing school there that night, we had a very mery time of it, there was a good many young folks present we sang some songs together and then a rivalry started between Illinois and Kansas to see which could sing the best songs and in the best style, after a few hours of merry strife we acknowledged the supremacy of the Kansas girls, In the morning we started again on our pilgrimage not feeling so merry and cheerful on account of the previous night's enjoyment, The road  still continued very rough and hard on our animals we were still on the bluffs of the Missouri river which in this place are about twenty five miles wide, Oh the hardship of going up and down those bluffs I shall never forget, we had to double teams going up hill and then take hold of the wagons and help, every ten yards we would block the wheels and take a breathing spell and so on resting at intervels till at last we gained the top feeling very thankful indeed and expecting  at last to find the long promised level land, but bitter disapointment there lay a steep descent and on the othere side another terrific hill it was almost enough to discourage and make us give up in dispair.

On this day we again made only twenty miles owing to the uneven roads, we camped at night foot sore and tired on the banks of a beautiful little stream called Walnut Creek, It was a nice camping place as there was wood water and grass plenty.  I now began to enjoy in earnest the solitary expanse of prairies and the deprivation of the luxuries of cities, After traveling all day over the hot shelterless prairie it was indeed a delightful feeling of repose came over us as we saw in the far distance the long belt of timber which conceals within its green boughs the stream of cool running water, It is as unfailing a sign of water on the western prairies, as the Oasis is to the parched and wearied traveler on the great African Desert.  This night we enjoyed ourselves hugely, had a good meal of stewed rabbits and prairie chickens which we killed during the day, and as the evening was cold we built a rousing fire got out our buffalo skins spread them on the grass all round the fire, and stretched ourselves at full length to rest our weary limbs.  And now commenced the merry part of our voyage the joke, song, and laugh went round as merrily as if it was all a holyday break, and we intirely forgot the solemn fact that there were more hills to be surmounted on the morrow, forgot all the vexations and annoyances of the day and thought only of spending pleasantly the passing hour,  The night was so beautifully calm and clear that we concluded not to set our tent and we set our guard and lay down to sleep in regular Indian style by our camp fire.  The night passed calmly without any annoyance from our horses or what more frequently happens from our fellow travelers.  but I must say that thefts are of very rare"},{"pageid":64606,"pagefilename":"94bef414269f9dcd778eb615067e81db.jpg","transcription":"8\nrare occurrance the inflicting of immediate punishment which is the invariable rule of our society on the plains the offender being caught is instantly tried by a jury picked up on the road the witnesses both for and against are heard and if not proved he is discharged forthwith, if guilty he will be punished according to the enormity of the offense, if for horse or mule stealing or murder, he is hung to the nearest tree, if a less grevious crime he is tied to a tree or wagon wheel and receives from ten to one hundred lashes on the bare back the amount to be fixed by the jury.  The certinty of immediate and severe punishment is a wholesome check to the evil disposed so much so that of late we have not many fears of being annoyed from that source.  On the third day we commenced our journey very early as we had to make thirty miles to the next camping ground, our old enemies the bluffs still surrounded us, and made it tiresome work, about noon to day some antelope came in sight and we had a very exciting time trying to shoot some of them but could not accomplish it, as they were very shy, and we were not acquanted with the manner of hunting them, we afterwards found it out from the Indians, you can take a red hankerchief tie it to your ramrod, and find a low hollow place in the prairie, raise your signal high in your hand, and let it fall quite naturally to the ground keep repeating this signal every two or three minutes, and if there are any antelope within two or three miles they will run towards the signal you have your gun all ready and when they show their heads above the brow of the hill you can shoot them without any trouble if you have a double barrel rifle you will perhaps have a chance to shoot to of them as they generally feed in pairs.  The flesh of the antelope is the finest meat I ever tasted it is nice tender and delicious far ahead of venison.

After ???? interruption we resumed our journey, we passed across several smaller streams this day we travelled about twenty five miles and reached the town of Marysville one hundred miles from St Joe at nightfall. We camped on the banks of the Big Blue river which runs through the town, it is a very nice stream having the peculiar characteristic of all Kansas rivers, viz, about one foot deep twenty wide and clear running water with a gravelly bottom the water is cool and tastes first rate. In the neighborhood of this river the bluffs are almost as high as those on the shore of the Missouri. the town has a very fine site on the bluffs commanding a view of the prairis for miles on every side. It is a place of some imprtance being the last outfitting place for immigrants for Pikes Peak, Utah and California and the residence of the Government Inspector of goods for U.S. troops in the west. the trains are here examined to ascertain that the supplys are all right and to prevent the shipment of any contraband article at the expense of Government. The town has a population of about one thousand and one pretty respectable looking street and some first rate stores a newspaper office Land Office a few lawyers and some doctors. After looking all about the town we packed up and turned again westward our first job was to get across the Big Blue aa very difficult undertaking with our heavily loaded wagon there is a very steep descent of about one hundred feet to the bed of the river in the middle a bed of quicksand and a hill to raise on the other side however we hitched four horses to each wagon and"},{"pageid":64609,"pagefilename":"e12074da9543db248785f854726b353e.jpg","transcription":"11\nwent at it with a will. It was very easy to get down but we stuck fast in the middle and the horses could not budg another inch Joe and myself were standing on the feed box and in getting down to help the horses Joe caught his foot in a rope and dove head first into the stream the water was cold as ice and the morning frosty but there was no pity for him but all had a harty laugh at his expense. I was more fortunate and jumped in without getting any wet the water not being deep and we all wore long miners boots by dint of hard pulling and pushing we succeeded in getting out of the ugly hole but had the same operation to repeat to bring across the other wagon. Once more on the road the aspect of the country was slightly undulating the grass so fine and green it was really a charming sight the boundless prairie far as the eye could reach in every direction I cannot compare it to anything but the ocean. We journeyed on pleasantly without incident of any kind, the weather now was getting pretty warm it was now uncomfortably so there was a high wind blowing the dust rose in clouds and almost blinded us to add to our troubles we met no water during the days travel so that horses and men were almost exhausted. We traveled thirty mile and camped on the Big Sandy river for the night this stream is precilely like the big Blue river only is is some smaller being about ten feet wide.  We camped here for the night the most dirty fitugued looking set of gold hunter you could find on the road between St Joe and Denver City. In the morning we arose fresh as if we had slept on feather beds and resumed our journey we met nothing worth describing on this day the country had about the same appearance as on the previous day we made twenty five miles and camped on the Little Sandy"},{"pageid":64610,"pagefilename":"75a85ea3c2ce1045417e05f973ddff9c.jpg","transcription":"river a beautiful little stream but so small that in any other country it would be called a rivulet. The next day about noon we struck the little Blue River the most singular river I saw in this strange country it is about three hundred miles long about twenty broad and three deep it runs through a level prairie the water even with the surface of the ground the water is a very fine taste and of a deep blue color if you take some up in a glass it has the appearance of having been colored there was plenty of fish swimming about which could plainly be seen through the water. We now met plenty of game ducks [unclear] Rabbits Prairie Chickens in abundance and we fared in most luxurious style. Our road lay parallel with the river and almost along its banks through the day I was charmed with the looks of that beautiful stream, at night we camped on its banks the pretiest camping ground we yet had. After supper we got out our flutes had some music and singing and enjoyed ourselves till a late hour of the night. In the morning we resumed our journey again all day along the banks of the Blue still the same beautiful color in the water the same level prairie on either side at noon we came to a Ranch called Pawnee Ranch I went in to ask some questions of the proprietor but on intering the door was struck dumb on seeing on the counter a human skull with the following inscription on the forehead \"died from asking to many questions\" I drew back again quickly without making any inquiries of the churlish owner I suppose he was much annoyed from travellers and put up this [hedion] warning as an answer to to all who [unclear] by.

This afternoon we also met the Pony Express returning from San Francisco he passed us like the wind and we could not get a single word of news we camped tonight on the Blue River again. The following day at noon we parted from this beautiful little stream having traveled fifty miles along its banks we now struck out on the broad open prairie on  the old military road to California this road has been well worn by travel it is about one hundred feet broad and cut down from the constant rise about one foot its whole width. The whole immigration to and from California in 1848 and 1850 was over this highway it is now a splendid road the peculiar nature of the soil rendering it when exposed to the sun as hard as brick without any assistance from man. It is far ahead of the smoothest Mac Adanized roads in the States a wagon loaded with six to making no impression whatever on its flinty surface tonight we had to camp on the open prairie without wood or water the prospect was not all all encouraging and we could not help contrasting it with our abundance of the night previous of the Little Blue. We pitched our tent and camped on the side of the road picketed our horses and downharted and unhappy we threw ourselves on our blankets to find some rest. This was the first time I began to think of home with many regrets for leaving it all the hardships and difficulties of our undertaking then rose before my mind vividly and I could not help thinking we had sacrificed our good established business the comforts of home and friends to come on this wild goose chase for now in its sober reality I could not consider it in any other light."},{"pageid":64612,"pagefilename":"e45b9dba459fee1054ece2ac80b535e0.jpg","transcription":"So curious is it that no sooner did we realize a small share of hard life than we commence to complain of what we brought [unclear] ourselves knowingly and expecting even worse than what we then experienced.

In the morning we rose very early and were again on the road in about three hours we struck the great Plat River at grand island ten miles below Fort Karney we were so starved out for want of cooked victals that we determined to spend the remainder of the day and night here. The river at this place is about a mile wide having a large green island in the centre, the water will average about one foot in depth all the way a cross it is however very hard for man or horse to cross on account of quicksand indeed you may say the river is nothing more than a moving bed of sand you could no drink it unless you were almost famished with thirst we could not use it untill it lay in a vessel for an hour to settle.On the banks of the river there was a thick belt of Cottonwood timber about one eight mile thick our camp was in this wood shortly after encamping as we were standing on the edge of the river we saw some huge animal moving on the island we soon found that it was a buffalo Joe and Jim took hold of their guns [unclear] into the river and waded across to the island but they could not get within of him it is almost impossible to shoot a single Buffalo they are so cautious.

We now came in sight of Fort Karney and could see the glorious old \"Star spangled banner\" floating proudly on the breeze. The Fort consists of about twenty houses occupied as barracks officers quarters and a Post Office enclosing a square about one acre with twelve six pounder guns mounted three on each side of the square what they were placed there for I could not imagine as they could not fire them off without knocking down the buildings. It is very curious why they selected such a position for a fort it has no natural advantages whatever there isnot any shlter from an enemy no elevation to the ground and it is a mile away from the river and they have not even got a mud enclosure around it and I should think in case of assault the insiders would have no advantage over the besiegers.

The road now lay along the bank of the river sometimes close by the edge of the water and again a mile away from it, the Antelope now came within range frequently and we succeeded in killing a few of them we now lived like princes plenty of the best kind of game with bread, butter, beans, pork salt Dried Apples fish tea and coffee and plenty of wood and water, we felt in such high spirits that a days journey of thirty miles did not tire us in the least.

We always gave them the remains of our meals but it only made them clamerous for more of course we could not satisfy them our two wagon loads of provisions if shared among them would not make one meal for the multitudes that surrounded us at every meal and it was the most painful thing I ever experienced to see them watch us as we put the bite to our mouths with a most hungry entreating look.

In most places it was devoid of grass and what was very strange not a sign of a shrub tree or even a willow the peculiar characteristic of this country being to have timber on its river banks and in no other place.

After our supper we looked up good quarters for our poor starved horses we found a place where the grass was splendid and tied them there for the night leaving a watch to look out for their safety we then lay down and had a comfortable nights sleep.

We felt that something must be done and done soon or we should be hemmed in without hope of escape it would be the hight of madness to remain in our present position so we resolved to leave it or provoke the Indians to immediate attack, so ten of our members brought in our horses harnessed them up to the wagons and made all ready for a start the other forty still kept the rifles on the cock and presented at the foe.

But the Indian could perform some astonishing feats on horseback one was riding on one side of his horse so that we who were standing one hundred yards distant could not say whether he was on the horses back or not, another one was laying three stones down on the road, about twenty yards apart and then the Indian would gallop towards them pick up one stone sit erect on his horse again turn over on the side of his horse just holding on by one toe and one hand pick up the second on and so on with the third all done in an instant so fast that the eye could scarcely follow his movements he rode in triumphantly with the three stones in his hands."},{"pageid":64623,"pagefilename":"bfd15edc03dddd2785cf61e21e69ea75.jpg","transcription":"25\nThese Indians appeared to be very friendly and well disposed towards us eager to trade skins and moccasins for anything we might offer them.

In this part of the country were a great many rabbits called here Jackass Rabbits but I am told by people that are well informed on the matter that they are the regular old country hare they are very large we succeeded in killing some and the flesh was excellent, there is a knack in hunting them which if you do not know you could not kill one in a month when one starts up before you you must stand still and then he will stand still also ang sit on his hind legs and face right towards you if he is too far off for a shot advance slowly towards him in a straight line if you go zigzag he will know it at once and start off in this way you can come close enough to shoot him if he does take the alarm and start stop still again"},{"pageid":64624,"pagefilename":"c8df707a855bfcb329cdea9d0168b968.jpg","transcription":"26\nand he will not go far until he stops when you can repeat the same maneuvre again I would never miss killing one that I started unless he might happen to get to his burrow.

The day was remarkably bright and clear and we saw what we at first supposed to be a cloud straight before us to the west after looking for a few minutes I noticed that it did not alter its position in the least and if it was a cloud it must drift in some direction, its appearance was pyramidal and of a bright blue color after watching it about an hour I became convinced that it was the mountains and I afterwards found out that It was Longs Peak about two hundred and fifty miles distant said to be the highest peat of the Rocky Mountains.

The next day our friend William Clancy? arrived in town he was just from the gold regions of Gregory and gave us a very gloomy picture indeed of gold mining and our prospects he advised us to sell our goods (we could then get an eneromous price for them) realize all the money we could, and start back to the States. We would not consider such a proposition for a moment he then said if we were bound to go to the mountains that the best place for us was to go the Arkansas Diggings, about one hundred and eighty miles from Denver. He said it was a new discovery reported very rich and the immigration towards that place was not very numerous as yet so that day we made up our minds to start on the next morning for the Arkansas. We made all necessary preparations and started at daylight for the mountains about fifteen miles distant. the gigantic mass of earth seemed to be raising out of the earth every step we took towards it by noon we had made only eight miles and when we camped it seemed as far off as it was in the morning its tremendous peaks covered with eternal snow hung threathiningly over our heads and were in sight hundreds of miles north and south. We stopped only a short time for dinner and took another start the country here was slighting undulating but not enough to be called hilly and preserved the same aspect to the very base of the mountains.

The dirt laying close to the rock is what is called the pay dirt  you will have to shovel that into your sluice a long box about from fifty to five hundred feet long with a small stream of water running through it and riffles placed near the end charged with quicksilver to catch the gold. The earth is shoveled in from the gulch runs down the whole lenght of the sluice carried along by the force of the water when it gets to the rifles the lighter particles will roll over the riffles but the gold being the heaviest will drop down and amalgamate with the quicksilver which is placed at the bottom of the riffles to receive it. You may keep shoveling all day then you take out your riffles squezze your quicksilver in a rag and the gold will seperate from it you then take your quicksilver and put it into a bottle it only loses twenty per cent by using what remains then is gold having only a small alloy of black sand."},{"pageid":64646,"pagefilename":"0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64647,"pagefilename":"a19a90c552f2a3b06ee8ed38ac52fa46.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64648,"pagefilename":"4ab084bc02ef49d862eeecfeeac3cbf7.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64649,"pagefilename":"9aba555079fb226adcbbfe6b036da81a.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64650,"pagefilename":"a200421189e49562ef6f390fe8c36f50.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64651,"pagefilename":"9a7d2405695cd9c12d0484295622c67d.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64652,"pagefilename":"b339d9a2f43b87ca083ac6046f3b037e.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64653,"pagefilename":"b43f463b1a62d22a2c61d65b1882be41.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64654,"pagefilename":"e4089fb0d2a640c9049ebdf9b17c5269.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64655,"pagefilename":"c30b7cf398f604ea288615e8f600f4e4.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64656,"pagefilename":"3a474754b42c2de0bf4cc46241cddef2.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64657,"pagefilename":"0e7ef9c7c1472ea030f5996fd6741e00.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64658,"pagefilename":"74c0a01d535b8560c08300da329f2894.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64659,"pagefilename":"9f8a09e250dd639a32352b4eb57e7c45.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64660,"pagefilename":"f8dc28a8046a7dac77a081312bffea98.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64661,"pagefilename":"1898c3dab3e926f781c3ef8ded832691.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64662,"pagefilename":"ac9c4b51e1f188edae86682ecf980071.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64663,"pagefilename":"ca5afeaecdefb5ff48123be4a40e474c.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64664,"pagefilename":"85ff1e97a6a5f25895f51b5d4bd010fb.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64665,"pagefilename":"3fd4170bccd3810a42ed3585f5d4d2a2.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64666,"pagefilename":"d08d271c6a07d8edbcdaebb1613d400b.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64667,"pagefilename":"01828d415d55a36fe87fd11ae9930294.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64668,"pagefilename":"f8b4e6ad608ada1b01b0c78c488aa8d1.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64669,"pagefilename":"fc5986256f24cdd09a5aad3e64007806.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64670,"pagefilename":"5bea5fa3deaa1850d6735888a7b56ec3.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64671,"pagefilename":"886ee6725c79c33be07141576a193fa5.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64672,"pagefilename":"c2cbea735a9a8f15f51ed4fdfa4558a0.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64673,"pagefilename":"0ce2f9c9a905efbc8236d662e0a606e5.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64674,"pagefilename":"eb03a0ef34016de99dd3c8b471bd6058.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64675,"pagefilename":"0cbcc9c3e0fe16d85de88f7317f78a5c.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64676,"pagefilename":"ef09f0cee3023ce40555d4d9514eda91.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64677,"pagefilename":"f6cb1db6bb582c58d2c8f5268c2036b0.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64678,"pagefilename":"ce154790f34d61c4ddf2f11c8c17462f.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64679,"pagefilename":"6b6a1699a0ad1a864ebeb5401d85e4c3.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64680,"pagefilename":"b70fbe17f00e1756f1f5acf04da22ae1.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64681,"pagefilename":"be9a43d4675039f964fb0f92874dc331.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64682,"pagefilename":"327bb64967720c6f48ff6bce3988cfbf.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64683,"pagefilename":"f758484b5c0ddf5946a2a4891b72181e.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64684,"pagefilename":"741814e739f36213ddcd5e80bd9e1e50.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64685,"pagefilename":"fc57766696ee98091ebca2cc11a8d2ba.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64686,"pagefilename":"481015d30dd79aba1c2988f47c17b17e.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64687,"pagefilename":"5f2a4c4659d3554842617308533fb4ae.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":64688,"pagefilename":"62ae6c482866fc4e9e5424af292c52fa.jpg","transcription":"and we gathered closely aroung a bright blazing fire of pine.

Many buildings had been put up and others were building which would be called first clap buildings in many of our eastern cities. On Larimer St near the bridge was built a government Post Office and adjoining it they were constructing a U.S. Mint. it had already the appearance of a substantial and permanent city. I noticed that the streets were  tronged?  by Sioux Indians and upon inquiry I ascertained that there was about five thousand within a half mile of the city on the river bank. It caused great uneasiness in the city the inhabitants of which felt the utmost apprehension of an attack but the savage horde. They had already organised a company of militia for its protection on the day after our a arrival they had invited the chiefs to a consultation in the town hall. six chiefs attended and the result of the conference was that the Indians agreed to go five miles down the river and encamp. the citizens agreed that if the Sioux were attacked by the Utes with whom they were then at war to send a company of militia to their assistance. The chiefs left apparently well satisfied we were also very glad to get rid of such dangerous neighbors for there was no denying the fact that they could have taken the city for there was not more than seven or eight hundred men opposed to their five hundred warriors.

I think there was a thousand tents they were all planted nicely in uniform rows crowds of women and papouses were gathered round every wigwam the place resembled a vast beehive they were a most dirty and repulsive looking set. some of them were almost intirely naked and wallowing in filth and mire. We gathered from them partly by signs and an odd word that we could understand that a few days before they had a battle with the Utes that they had killed ten of the enemy and that eighteen of their own braves had fallen. One old Indian took us round and with pride showed is the bloody trophies of the fight gory looking scalps were stuck on long poles and each carried by a young boy while we were looking at the horrid specticle they gathered in a circle round the scalps and commenced a lamentation for the fallen b raves. One stout Indian beat time on the Tom, Tom a piece of deer skin stretched on a hoop it sounds lilke a drum. the fellow beat on  this?  as if his very life depended on his exertions the rest went round in a circle every little while letting out a mournful howl and keeping time with the tom, tom. when the drummer got exhausted another quickly took his place and in the circle they were dropping out and getting in all the while.

After showing us all over the incampment we gave our friendly old guide a few pieces of money and returned to our camp. It was now dark yet the everlasting \"tom, tom, and the accompanying howling was kept up as vigerously as ever and at short intervals we could hear a savage whoop given that would make your blood run cold. I felt the greatest sorrow for the poor young captives how they must tremble at heart although they show no outward signs of fear, as they hear those demons exciting their wild and ungovernable passions untill at last they get to such a pitch of fury that nothing but the blood of their  captive inemy can soothe them. After getting to our tents we had some supper and then lay downs to have some sleep. but we were disapointed in that the uproar made by the savages drove all thought of sleep out of our heads and they kept it up without ceasing for a  moment all the night. coming on the morning they howled yelled and shrieked like mad devils it was the most horrid din that I ever heard.

After this arrangement was made they commenced striking their tents and prepering to move down the river according to the terms of the treaty intered into on the day before. By noon not a vistage of them remained the place looked as silent as the grave they were got away without any trouble to the immense relief of the inhabitants of the city. It was now the latter end of June and immigration was at its hight The city was thronged with people and the roads leading into and from the city were covered with a continous string of teams. it looked as if all the people of the States had got demented and started off without making any preperation fearing they might be too late to lift the heaps of gold from the bowels of the earth. All were now full of high hope they would not listen to a disparaging word said about the mines of the country. I can imagine how some of those same sanguine people felt about one month later, half starved broken down in spirit and pocket. they turn their face sorrowfully back towards \"America\" perhaps as I have known some of them that lost everything and undertook a weary journey of about eight hundred miles not having a morsel to eat depending on charity for their subsistance and their bare feet leaving its imprint in blood."},{"pageid":64693,"pagefilename":"a4e5e02ec739da5d1ae8460e20524d67.jpg","transcription":"Seeking for gold seems to be the most exciting thing in the world let men only get the gold fever and no matter how well they are prospering in the world they will become unreasonable, sacrifice home, means, and friends, abandon all that is worth living for, for a shadow.

That is the place to try a true friend he that would stick to me crossing those plains through toil hardship and sickness I would call a true friend and I should depend on him ever afterward.

And indeed I think it was a very appropriate phrase home as America seemed an almost infinite distance from us divided by a boundless sea. we all gave way to gloomy thoughts at the prospect of having to traverse those dreary plains again. On our coming out we had hope to cheer us on. time passed quickly all obstacles were met and overcome with cheerfullness. the dreary and monotonous plains never wearied our us our sole trouble was to get over the miles as quickly as possible. The method of enforceing law in Denver was of such a novel character that I think a short description of it will be interesting. There was a judge elected by the people for trying civil cases. there was a regular session of court held the same as in our city. one case where a friend of mine was the plaintiff will illustrete it fully. He  ?  a \"Ranche\" about two miles down the Platt River and rented it to a man about a year before the tenent never paid any rent and laid claim to the property saying he had just as good a right to it as any body else. My friend suid him and got a judgment from the court issued in the following shape. \"the owner of said claim is hereby authorized to take possession of his property forthwith the means to be employed are that the said owner shall take as many men well armed as he should deem nessary and take possession of his property peaceably if he may forcibly if he must And if there is any resistance made to this writ he shall be justified and held guiltless of killing any and all parties that shall resist this order of the court."},{"pageid":64695,"pagefilename":"ae1a276702f6a897a527c38f24849aed.jpg","transcription":"Another place I saw a legal notice posted on a corner it was to the following effect, that the undersigned had built a bridge some two months since on Lariner st over Cherry Creek connecting the town of Auraria and Denver, that certain parties having failed to make the payments on said bridge as agreed upon, that after three days they forbid any one to cross said bridge at their peril that they should have a sufficient force there and shoot down any who would attempt to disobey this order of the court. Before we left the city I heard that they raised the money and paid for the bridge. This summary way of doing business works to a charm there is no resisting the court no such thing heard of as fining any one for contempt because no one would dare to show it he would be punished on the spot and in a most unpleasant manner. Since we arrived in the city there had been two executions and by making inquiries I found out that there is somebody hung every week. You must not think from this that was a hard place to live in I never saw a more quiet and law observing city I believe the severe and instantanous punishment of crime  ?  preventive, all the murders committed here spring from the gambling table the termination of a dispute was always left to the pistol or Bowie knife if one of the gamblers was killed the surviver was sure to have his neck stretched before two days and thus the community would be well rid of two ruffians. What was considered a crime deserving of death when committed by gamblers was passed off quietly as justifiable when done by other parties, if two men got into a dispute on the street they could settle it in any manner they thought proper and if one killed the other it was all done in fair fight and there was no hint of punishment but if it was a gambler he deserved no mercy and was hung up without any mercy."},{"pageid":64696,"pagefilename":"ec8dc2c77a7141988f93fb1b35687b58.jpg","transcription":"All our preparations being now completed on Friday the first day of July we determined to make a start for home. About noon we went to the \"Ranche\" to take out our animals our horses were easily found they were very poor and there was no danger of any one stealing them. A friend of ours who came with us did not have such good fortune he put a valuable team of mules into the Ranche now they could not be found the poor fellow grew frantic when he discovered his loss. The Ranche keeper could give no account of them but he supposed they were stolen during the night by the laws of the place he was responsible and could be made liable for the worth of any property left in his possession. But the owner of the mules would rather have them at that time than twice their nominal value at Denver. So he hired horses and scoured the country in all directions but it was a vain pursuit he never seen or heard aught of them. I am firmly convinced that the rascally \"Rancher\" connived at stealing them it was said that many valuable teams were taken from his place. Any how he got a judgement against the Ranche keeper for two hundred and fifty dollars. The Ranche was levied on and was to be sold in thirty days but the poor fellow could not remain there that long under expenses so he intrusted its collection to a lawyer of good standing in the city, and getting some friends to aid him he purchased another team and started for home. His lawyer was to send the price of his mules in a month but he never got a cent of it nor never received a bit of information from his lawyer there is no doubt but what the latter got the money and appropriated it to his own use. An honest man is a a rare thing to be found in any place but I think it is impossible to find one at all in a gold producing country, the very fact of  being where got easy brings around a lot of these sharks to prey upon the industry of the hardy miner who perils health and even life for the shining ore and no"},{"pageid":64697,"pagefilename":"57126eb7e5f8460d9367169b02123ad6.jpg","transcription":"sooner does he hold the object of his desires in his hands than those blood suckers swarm around him and by one pretext or another coax his hard won earnings from him.

Those soft silky looking fellows that never do a days work seem to have a charm by which they attract all the spoils in their own pockets. you will see them lounging lazily around dealing in claims taking in some poor green horn, and when they can make it profitable I think they have no scruple of cutting a throat. At noon Friday we started from Denver City the last thing that I seen of it was a darkey washing cloths he sung out as we passed him, \"halloo boys bound for America give my respecs to Uncle Sam. in a few minutes we went down a bluff and lost sight of the City of Denver. We took the old road by the Platt River. we heard of some Indian massacres on the cut off and knew it was very dangerous to travel it. Our party consisted of three wagons and only five persons rather a small party for crossing those dreary plains. We felt dreadful lonesome. I could not help contrasting our present position coming back disapointed from the land of gold our teams almost starved and ourselves worn out by hardships and anxieties of mind. On our journey hither we were full of high hope. we considered our fortunes was ready for us as soon as we should reach the mountains we had plenty of merry company all as sanguine as ourselves and with high health and rugged strength we enjoyed ourselves hugely and had nothing to ask for we traveled about five miles that afternoon and camped at night with the tribe of Sioux Indians that left Denver a few days before.

Before it grew quite dark we saw a great cloud of dust coming from the east soon we could see that it was a long string of wagons it was a train of about twenty wagons loaded with a crusher and machinery steam engine boiler & c, There was about twenty five men with the train and we were very glad to have company for the night we found among them some acquantances from Chicago and got all the news from home in a short time. They were just as anxious to hear accounts of gold mining so we told them our experiences and what we considered their prospects in the country. I think the crusher is the only way that gold can ever be got in paying quantities from the rocky mountains. the quartz is rich in every part and if they can only get machinery that can pulverize it there is no doubt but that they can make money in that way. We chatted with them till very late of home and friends they left Chicago just seven weeks before that time and considering their heavy load they made first rate time. We all camped together that night father than some howling and yelling had no annoyance from the Indians just as soon as it gets dark they will not come near a white mans camp they know that we keep a watch and they are afraid of getting shot. At sunrise the next morning we parted from the train each one going in opposite direction. our road to day was through the finest land I had yet seen in this country the grass was nice and green and about four feet high I think it would be first rate lands to cultivate. There was a good many sowing hay there it was a very profitable business last winter hay was worth two hundred dollars a ton in the Gregary Diggings about sixty miles from the place."},{"pageid":64699,"pagefilename":"96648ee3963cdfa56169697b67164ff4.jpg","transcription":"To day we passed a beautiful island on the Platt River it was intirely different from any islands that I had yet seen the banks were bold and high and covered to the edge of the water with willow trees. There is a  bridge across the river here many of the immigrants cross it as it is the shortest route to Gregory there is a very fine house on the island but so covered in by thick foliage that you can not get a glimpse of it untill you are standing bedside it. It was built about fifteen years ago by a fur company for the purpose of a trading post with the Indians of the Rocky Mountains. We were now passing through a most delightful country the land rich, the grass luxurious, the blue river running clear and ripling by. it is the most charming place between the Missouri river and the Rocky Mountains. This day we met five crusher trains and great crowds of emmigrants pushing their way westward we would scan the faces eagerly while passing them to see if we could discover among them any one with whom we were acquanted. The Indians were very numerous in this vecinity we had left the Sioux country behind and were now among the Arrapahoes. they are a little superior to the Sioux in habits and appearance. it seems that wherever the white and the Indian live close together that the Indian will become filthy and depraved. It is accounted for by the white man selling him whisky. the Indian is passionately fond of it and would sell himself body and soul family and friends and children for to gratify his fiery appetite. The Indians used us very friendly seemed to be very eager to trade with us they brought out heaps of buck skins moccasins and buffalo roves we got some of the latter from them for about one pound of sugar for each hide.

Immense crowds of emmigrants passed us every day  one day I counted one hundred wagons. the average of seven persons to a wagon would make seven hundred persons About sixty miles from Denver we came to St Vrains Fort an abandoned trading post it was established for the protection of the fur traders and once had a company of United States soldiers. Its mud walls were still standing about ten feet high six feet thick and an area of about a square achre it stood on slightly elevated ground and a first rate position for defense. We camped near its walls for the night, somehow although it was ruined and deserted we considered it far pleasanter to camp by its walls than to lay down on the open prairie. It was a fine moonlight night and as I sat there on the banks of the murmuring river listening to its monatonous rippling and seeing around me the vast prairie its undulating surface looking like the heaving sea, I could imagine that those ruined walls beside me were repaired I thought that crowds of martial men passed to and fro I imagined the sentry pacing to and fro on the wall and that I could hear his joyous ringing shoot of alls well.

The appearance of the country did not change much till we got to the Beaver Creek \"cut off,\" the road that we took on our journey out the grass now had a red schorched appearance and the horses did not much relish it after having such splendid grass the previous week. The road now presented an animated appearance crowds pushing on towards the mountains it looked like one continuous string uniting civilization with the wilderness We were greatly annoyed by their stopping us and making inquries it grew to be so great a neusance that we would not stop at all but answer all the questions we could while moving. we were compelled to do this or not make any progress on our journey. Our horses showed signs of giving out so we could not drive them more than from ten to fifteen miles a day, and sunday if we could find a good spot of grass we gave them all day to rest. In two weeks we came to O Fallons Bluffs the only spot on the whole route where the Bluffs extended to the river edge. they are some two or three hundred feet high standing perpindicular from the water it is very laborious work for teams to get over them.

The steady tide of immigration still continued pouring westward, and I noticed in some trains that we met whole familes of women and children the sufferings of and hardships of the road was enough for a strong man to endure, but women and children were not fit for it and I think it was a most barbarous thing to bring them on the road at all. Since we passed O Fallons Bluffs we have been traveling in the Cheyannes country, they are a fine warlike tribe of Indians the \"Camanchi\" of this part of the country they are above begging and other low lived employments of the most part of the tribes of the west. They are said to be great fighters have immense herds of ponies and almost live on horseback, in trading they are quick at making a bargain if they do not like your price they will not try to get more out of you but they will turn away instantly try a trade with some one else and have no more to do with you. It took us a week to get through their country and I really thought more of them than any I had yet seen on the plains. One evening about an hour before sunset we were camped only a short distance from a Cheyanne village, and a hunter drove up to our camp, he was riding a small pony and had the carcasses of two antelopes and a young deer also slung across his back. After saluting us in the usual friendly manner, \"how, how,\" we understood from him that he had been on the hunt all day and had nothing to eat, we gave him some tea and crackers which he eat with a relish, he then went to his pony and cut off the livers of the antelopes and gave them to us we considered it a great compliment for the Indians scarcely ever make a present of anything.

After that we done a very foolish thing and it gave us the greatest uneasiness during the whole night he acted so very clever about giving us the liver that as the liquor was passing around we thought we ought to treat him we gave him a pretty good mix of whiskey and I never was so astonished it acted upon him like poison in five minutes he was dreadful sick, he lay down on the ground and rolled over the sweat stood in big beads on his face and bare arms. he had on a white cotton shirt that some traveller had given him and he felt mighty proud of it. I got scared I thought the fellow might die, and if so his tribe would think we had poisoned him and have revenge out of us I got a pail of water and poured it on his head and wrists that made him feel a great deal better, we done all we could for him while we were all busy doctering him another Indian rode over I suppose they had seen him coming and were uneasy at his delay they spoke together a few minutes when the new comer turned round towards us with a smile and asked for \"whiskey\" we shook our heads pointed to the fellow laying on the ground and told him as well as we could by signs that it would make him sick that had no effect on him he seemed quite anxious to be in the same state and said very coaxingly \"me sick too.\" But we would not give him any and in a short time he rode back furiously to the village, we now saw the mistake we had made if the Indians once get the taste of whiskey they will risk anything to get plenty of it."},{"pageid":64704,"pagefilename":"2546e67309646acbec02736e074975be.jpg","transcription":"Our patient was now pretty well recovered and coming to his senses the first thing he done was to reach for his rifle and discharge it he had sense enough to remember that it was loaded and that it was dangerous in his hands.

We were very much afraid that the Indians would come and make an attack on us to get the whiskey we kept a strict guard all the night and I think they were hovering around us all the night but were afraid to make an attack as they knew we were prepared for them. However the night passed over without any trouble and we were mighty thankful for it. it is a very foolish thing under any circumstances to let Indians have the taste of whiskey. The moment you do it they lose all confidence in you become treacherous and extremly dangerous. you cannot trade or have any communication whatever with them afterward. In the morning we passed through the village the Indians eyed us savagely looking as if they would like to tare us in pieces. they did not come out as usual with their kind salute or their pile of skins and robes but kept a sullen silence while we were passing. All that enmity was caused by us having the whiskey they expected to find us unprepared and take it during the night but being mistaken in that and finding that we were on the elert they considered that we had done them some grevious injury I did not feel safe untill I got several miles between us and the unfriendly tribe That was the only time on our journey home that the Indians showed any hostile feelings and then it was provoked by ourselves and we were only five passing alone through this vast country of Indians."},{"pageid":64705,"pagefilename":"c04c7becf51b157fd9d9899d4ecfda18.jpg","transcription":"We now suffered a great deal from heat and thirst the burning mid summer sun poured down on us all the long day with his fiercest beams water was very scarce and although our road lay mainly along the bank of the river sometimes the road would not come near the river for eight or ten miles.

To add to our torments just as the sun went down the misquitoes assailled us furiously. they came around in myriads almost driving us mad by their incessent singing and their tantalizing sting. Of all the torments that ever was inflicted on poor humanity I think this is the most dreadful. there is not a moments relief no matter how tired you may be it is impossible to sleep you may lay down cover yourself all over with your blanket but you will not be safe.

Oftentimes I thought they would kill some of us the torture was most horrible and not to be compared to anything I ever experienced how I would long for some quiet cool spot where free from any annoyance I could have a few hours undisturbed slumber.

As I saw those innumerable resting places of the California immigrants I shudderingly thought what if I should yet be laid down on this long dreary endless road to take my last long sleep to make one of those lowly mounds of earth of which we passed hundreds every day. I confess the thoughts were exceedingly unpleasant and I longed more than ever for to reach the borders of civilization. About seventy miles from Fort Karney we came to a new established trading post and purchased there some nescessaries we paid thirty cents a pound for flour forty cents for sugar and forty cents for bacon. The house was what is called a \"adobe\" house being made intirely of mud the roof having a few timbers on it and then sodded at a distance you would think it a small natural hill. The travelers we met told us that we would find plenty of buffalo in a few days the news raised us to the highest state of excitement we longed to encounter the huge unwieldy native of the prairies. The following night we were aroused by a bellowing noise we supposed it to be a herd of buffalos as the noise gradually died away. In the morning we eagerly scanned the prairie in every direction but could see no signs of buffalo we harnassed up our horses and traveled about eight miles. We heard a low rumbling noise like distant thunder then a great cloud of dust arose increasing every moment in extent and reaching up to the clouds we were in the highest state of excitement the cloud of dust suddenly cleared away and we saw an immense hered of buffalo only about a quarter of mile distant. It was a most grand and imposing sight from the slight elevation on which we were standing this great living mass could be seen stretching miles and miles away as far as the eye could reach was one compact solid body moving in one direction and making the earth shake beneath them."},{"pageid":64709,"pagefilename":"cfacd7f5e37e111f731218b37ffc0bb7.jpg","transcription":"They were traveling parallel with the road and soon we were within one hundred yards of the nearest we got out our rifles fired a volley and dropped two of them. one died instantly the other received five or six shots before he stretched himself out this was a glorious commencement of buffalo hunting and we felt highly elated at our success. We then proceeded to dress our game one was a young bull about four years old the other an old chap about sixteen the young one was about the size of a large ox five of us had all we could do to roll him over. we first cut off the hump considered by hunters as the choicest part then we skinned him the skin is valueless in this season and we trew it away then we cut him up into quarters in the same way they dress beeves at home. We kept some for cooking fresh and jerked the balance this is rather a curious process and worth describing we tear off the meat with the grain in thin slices then throw on some salt if you wish but it is not necessary for saving it then hang it in the sun or suspend it before a hot fire untill thoroughly dry it is then jerked meat and perfectly cured you may throw it in the bottom of your wagon or in any out of the way place and it will keep sweet and  good for a year or more Jerked buffalo meat salt I liked the flavor of very well but could not indure it in any other shape I tried it boiled and fried but could not bear the taste, even the hump what is called sweh a delicious morsel is as tough a sole leather and the liver as tough as ordinary  beef. The buffalo is only vulnerable in one small place under the fore shoulder if you drive a bullet in there he will drop on the instant but if you strike him in any other place it only irritates but cannot seriously hurt him. I have known one case where a party of ten persons fired four rounds into a huge buffalo before he dropped on examining him after they found that twenty seven bullets  ?  gone into his body."},{"pageid":64710,"pagefilename":"f774e7aa5a07669227fe574052a6c4df.jpg","transcription":"The plain was now covered with buffalo far as the eye could reach in every direction. hunters were reaping a harvest of game, I counted no less than sixteen buffalo slaughtered that day. the herd was journeying slowly to the westward. They travel in such a compact body that if any thing suddenly forms an obstruction the formost ones cannot avoid it, but are propelled b the irrisistible force from behind into streams and sometimes over precipices. There is often great numbers of them destroyed before they stop on their headlong course For two days the immense herd stretched along on our right hand side and parallel with the river and extending inward far as the eye could reach. We had some glorious sport killed several of them merely for the glory of the thing, sometimes we would kill a buffalo and not take a particle of meat. there was enough of meat wasted there that season to feed the State of Illinois for a whole year. We now reached Karney City two miles from the Fort we felt as though we were once more on the borders of civilization. I went over to a Ranche to purchase some baked bread, we were almost starved living upon half cooked \"slap jacks\" and corn dodger. I bought a few loaves at a reasonable price, on coming out I saw a great commotion at the other end of the village upon inquiry I found that a huge buffalo bull had got into a \"coerell\" with the tame cattle. The crowd were punching him with long poles and trying to pusuade him to leave, he paid not the least attention to their hints and finally they tickled his sides with buck shot when he left rather suddenly. they did not want to kill him as they would have to drag his carcass away from the village.

The buffalo were now around us in swarms in every direction on both sides of the Platt far as the eye could reach was covered black with cattle. You could not from description form any idea this great mass of moving life. They were seemingly intirely regardless of our presence all the afternoon they crossed the road going down to the river to drink sometimes they would crowd on us so that we had to stop the horses to avoid mixing up with them, After we had camped about ten double teams belonging to the Fort and loaded with timber passed us they broke through the buffalo at a gallop scattering them right and left the drivers yelling at them like tame cattle, We were afraid they might stampede over us in the night for they were unpleasantly close to us we built a great fire trusting that that would keep them off for we were so wearied out by suffering from misquitoes and starvation that we were unable to keep watch I was woke several times during the night by a loud bellowing seemingly right by the side of our camp. I always looked out to see that our horses were safe, they were in deadly fear and trembled all the night. Yet if they once got loose with the buffalo when on a stampede it would be impossible to ever get them again, the lowest spirited critter that ever crossed the plain will run off with them and it requires the greatest precaution on the part of the traveler to keep his cattle from getting away from  ?  with the wild herd."},{"pageid":64712,"pagefilename":"48da03ac5318dcd6f6c1c039e024ee9d.jpg","transcription":"The night passed away without any accident in the morning when the sun rose there was countless herds of buffalo all around us we were hemmed in on every side, the only vacent spot of earth for miles was the small space that surrounded ourselves and horses. We got somewhat alarmed about getting ourselves and horses safely out of the beseigers lines. we hitched up drove our frightened and unwilling teams at the herd uttering the cries we heard from the soldiers the evening before and had the satisfaction to see the huge animals give away and open a passage for us. It was like the celebrated passage through the Red Sea, for miles and miles on either side of us was a solid body of those gigantic animals roaring and bellowing the very earth shaking beneath their tread. Sometimes a huge bull would plunge his horns into the earth and throw up a shower of earth and stones others would lay down on their sides and spin round as if they were revolving on a pivot they would continue at that untill they had a wore a circle into the ground Sometimes they were so unpleasantly close that we  struck?  them with the whip  they were awfully scaered and made the most frantic exertions to get out of our way. We tickled their sides with several volleys of buck shot  when struck they would throw their heels high in the air and strike their horns into the earth. there was plenty of calves among them but we could not get a shot at them the old one always protecting them sheltering them from us.

The next morning there seemed to be a general movement of the herd towards the south, they regularly immigrated north and south twice a year, going north as far as the Canada line and south as far as Mexico. We were now about twenty miles from the Platt River and had not seen a drop of water since leaving it there was a great drouth previously all over the country it was now forty days since we had left the mountains and it had not rained in all that time the grass was burned yellow and the ground parched up. Our horses suffered terribly this day being the second day without water We had a scanty supply for ourselves we drank of it sparingly as it was very warm and nauseating That gave out before night and we were parched and choking  an August sun poured down on us fiercely and the prairie stretched on every side of us like a boundless ocean no prospects of quenching our thirst or finding shelter from the fierce rays of the sun. The buffalo dotted the prairie in straggling groups trying to follow the course of the herd, but overpowered by the heat they stopped helplessly on the prairie unable to go in quest of water. At length as we were journeying along towards sundown almost despairing of finding relief for that night we suddenly came to a pole sticking up at the side of the road, although we had never seen a like sign before we knew that it indicated water in the neighborhood Quickly we unharnessed our horses and started out in all directions looking for the water at length we found it at the bottom of a hill, but only a miserable mud hole the water green and slimy full of monstrous  frogs that croaked  ?   as we approached them The side of the"},{"pageid":64714,"pagefilename":"3ac4b3aecb84d5622f03d0187957f077.jpg","transcription":"ditch was trampled into soft mud by the buffalo, however bad and disgusting as it was we were glad enough get it at that time I took up a pint cup full and swallowed it mighty quick. we could not let our horses near it they would kill themselves but we gave them a few pailsfull for the present. However we were glad to get it. we pitched our the tent and camped for the night. we had a hard struggle of it that night preparing something to eat. our supply of buffalo chips was very scarce, and we could not half boil the thick dirty water. a little tea thrown into that and some half cooked corn dodger formed out evening meal. The next morning one of our horses showed signs of giving out, one of his legs was greatly swelled we though it was from the bite of a snake and that it would soon wear away. But he continued to fail rapidly and the next day he was so swelled that he could not travel any more and we had to leave him behind. I felt the greatest regret as we abandoned the poor creature on the prairie. he seemed to be conscious that we were deserting him he made the most desperate exertions and followed us about a mile then he grew intirely exhausted and gave up the chase, but we heard him whining most pitiously for a long time afterwards, it was the hardest thing that occurred to us on that long journey, abandoning that poor faithful creature, after traveling so many hundred miles and now so near our journeys end. In about four days more we crossed the Little Blue River, there was plenty of buffalo in this locality. we stopped on this stream two days to recruit one horse for we now had only one and the poor thing was almost exhausted from pulling a two horse wagon and about six hundred pounds of equipage. We had quite a hard job to rig up  fills?  for a single horse an axe was out only tool, with that we chopped down two small cotton woods, and with ropes we soon made a temporary  ?"},{"pageid":64715,"pagefilename":"6e98bb37dd8ab3175ca43edb8a2d4ead.jpg","transcription":"Our journey now was over a splendid section of country along the valley of the Blue River. the trees were all bright and green forming a refreshing shade when the sun grew hot at mid day. We traveled forty miles along this stream on a perfectly smooth road and under the shade of tall forest trees it made such a contrast to the broad schorching prairie on which we were schorched for six weeks that it seemed as if we had got into paradise. After leaving that stream we had some pretty tuff times for the next fifty miles many times we almost perished from thirst we were sometimes a whole day xsposed to the fierce rays of the sun without getting a drop of water to drink. And to add to our troubles we were afraid that our remaining horse would give out, the poor creature was almost broken down from hard work and starvation, at this time we only made ten miles a day. Gladly we hailed our approach to Marysville we hoped at that place to find some sort of a hack to assist our unfortunate horse. We found the town greatly enlarged since we had passed through it. it had now quite the appearance of a business town in the States business had been quite lively there during the summer the store keepers looked stiff and important it looked like as if they were flush of money. We could not find any kind of crittre to buy or borrow so we had to commence our weary journey again on the old style, we passed through the town on Sunday morning and made ten miles that day in the evening a fierce hurricane arose quite a frequent thing in the plains and leveled Marysville with the ground the next day we saw crowds of the sufferers on their way to St Joe they had lost everything the only indications of a storm that we had was seeing some dark heavy clouds rising in the west about that time and a little rain but the wind was not unusually strong."},{"pageid":64716,"pagefilename":"c8f99499caf2bb4909d24bfbf19dfffa.jpg","transcription":"On coming to a camping ground this evening we met with a friend with whom we had traveled on the early part of our journey, one of his horses also died and he had purchased a yoke of oxen and was well pleased with the exchange he very generoulsly offered us the use of his remaining horse for the balance of the journey. We were now again on the borders of civilization there was a few farms on the banks of the streams, we eagerly purchased some vegatables butter eggs and bread we had none of these things for five months and you cannot imagine how good they tasted. We were a pretty hard looking set, sun burned as brown as Indians our hair and beard of five months growth and our cloths all torn into rags. our boots and shoes gave out more than a month since. Still we lived well we had an abundance of game, prairie chickens and quails they were so numerous that we could kill them with sticks, living so well we now took things quite leisuarly and was in no hurry together to the end of our journey. Plums and grapes grew in profusion in the forests the weather was beautiful and only for the great drouth we might have prolonged our journey a week more It was near seven weeks since we left Denver City and there had not been a drop of rain in that time farmers were greatly alarmed for their crops. their  ?  was dying in great numbers. We suffered great inconvenience from a scarcity of water we always had to carry a supply in a ten gallon keg and when that supply ran out we suffered very severely, only for that we would have probably have prolonged our journey another week. About fifty miles from St Joe we came into the bluffs of the Missouri River which was probably ten miles from us in a straight line, the whole country through which we now traveled was covered with enermos large cottonwood trees."},{"pageid":64717,"pagefilename":"aefa1fb0929c651610046c10d8aeb28a.jpg","transcription":"We arrived at the Missouri River without any other accident or adventure drove onboard the St Joe and Belmont ferry and soon landed on the levee of St Joseph. We felt very strange and odd suddenly transformed into a large city after wandering five months in the wilderness. Our returning journey from the mountains took just fifty two days including all delays from fatigue or other causes. Crowds of people gathered round us eagerly making inquiris about the land of gold we were some of the first returned pilgrims as they styled us we passed through the town to the lower end and then camped in the usual style some of our party felt big and wanted to go to a hotel they could not endure camp life another hour. There was still a few immegrants in St Joe about setting out for the west and there was ten crushers starting on the same day the whole number of crushers we met on the road was fifty three each one represented about ten thousand dollars. The first thing we done after hitching up was to go down town and into the a first class eating house we felt so very odd at first that we could hardly use a knife or fork it would be more natural to go with the victuals in the old style. We stopped in St Joe four days and then took the cors for Chicago arriving there two days after having made the whole trip to Pikes Peak and back in five months and two days."}],"title":"John D.

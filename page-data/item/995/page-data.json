Having perhaps the same foolish views \nof the rest of the young men of our place, I , determined \nto make one of the crowd bound for the new Eldorado \nof the west. Accordingly we raised a party consisting \nof seven persons, bought arms and equipments and\nembarked on our long and tedious journey. We started \non the Burlington and Quincy Rail Road running \nthrough the centre of the state the most fertile and \nbest settled part, and let me here remark, that on\nthis line is by far the best land in the west at the time.\nI traveled through there they had a most spendid harvest\nthe grain was as full and yellow and as I afterwards was \ninformed so vast was the crops that they could not ship \nit and were compelled to make fuel of it. On the following \nmorning we arrived at Quincy on the Mississippi River one\nof the most ancient towns in Illinois.

It was indeed a beautiful scene and one that I shall never forget the great father f water was clothed in all its splendor and granduer.  On the following morning we embarked on its broad boosom on board the steamer Pike, a splendid specimen of a Mississippi River boat large as the huge leviatians that plow furrows in the broad Atlantic her cabins a magnificent palace altogether one of those boats can compare favorably with the floating craft of any country.  And now all being ready we steamed up the noble river passing? by fairy looking islands that it would not take a great stretch of the imagination to suppose they were inhabited by the spirits of the red men who lived for ages on its shores.  Passing by rapidly all these scenes the steamer suddenly rounded to came up to the leevee and we were at the landing of the City of Hanibal,  Missouri.  We disembarked and proceeded to view the town & we found it to be a nicely situated town containing about four thousand inhabitants.  It is situated on the river bottoms parallel with the river and between its banks and the bluffs which are here many hundred feet in height.  The city has an appearance of buisiness there are a number of quite respectable looking stores which seem to be doing quite a thriving buisiness.  Here I first seen slavery there are a few niggers in the city its proximity to the Illinois shore prevents the holding of slaves to any great extent.  We stopped in this town only a very short time and once more started on the iron horse bound for the far off shores of the Missouri.  I must here make some remarks about the interior of Missouri it is a splendid looking farming country yet? between Hanibal? and St Joe about two hundred and fifty miles"},{"pageid":64601,"pagefilename":"5582e3583b24dab231313470089d299f.jpg","transcription":"3\nthere is scarcely the sign of a well cultivated farm you will think this very strange that people should pass such fine land so near a market, and go and locate in such out of the way places, as Kansas and Nebraska, but the reason is simple it is becausb it is a slave state. If northern man cannot go there and take a farm because they are averse to holding slaves and if he works his farm himself he is looked upon with scorn by his neighbor who works his farm by slaves he is constantly taunted with being from white trash and it annoys him so that he leaves in disgust and moves to some country where honest labor is not looked upon as a disgrace by the nabobs of the South. This is the only reason why this beautiful and fertile state is only settled along the river shores slavery is not a paying institution there consequently there is no danger of its spreading north as many of our northern people are afraid of, nature has erected barriers against slavery more potent than any that could be enacted by Congress, as soon as slavery is abolished in Missouri then will she take her stand along with her sister states the richest and proudest of all. One days ride on the railroad brought us clear across the state of Missouri into the city of St Joe the furthest northwestern city of the United States, it is situated on the banks of the river partly on the bottoms and partly on the bluffs. One would be surprised at finding such a large fine looking city away so far from civilization it has a compact well built and substantial appearence many of its buildings would compare favorably with the finest of our own great city, the Paytee House is as large at the Fremont House it is situated on the outskirts of the city on slightly elevated ground commanding a beautiful view of the Missouri river, from this house the Pony Express starts for California.

It was indeed a grand idea the interchange of news across the continent in such a short time almost equal to Rail Road speed the distance being about twenty hundred miles, over mountains and through deserts. We stopped in St Joseph about four days and then concluded it was time to proceed on our long journey. We went down to the Missouri river, and took passage on board of a ferry boat for Belmont, a village on the Kansas side about five miles from St Joe. The Missouri river here is about four hundred yards wide, the water is very yellow being a mixture of about one half part of sand and water, it has a very rapid current running at the rate of about ten miles an hour. In some places it is very deep but the sand bars are all movable which makes it very dangerous to navigation.

Each one made himself useful providing the evening meal or attending to the horses. some made a fire, some worked at putting up the tent and made a bed of blankets and quilts on the bare ground and others cutting ham making coffee and providing the other articles belonging to the prairie travelers life, The supper was delicious and sharpened as our appetites were by vigorous exercise and a strange climate we enjoyed the meal hugely, Ye epicures and good livers you should come out on the prairie shove a wagon up a hill about seven hundred feet high and you could appreciate a harty healthy meal without fearing any of the pangs of indigestion or dyspepsia After suppers we chatted a while, and then turned under our blankets for a nights rest, and I must say I never rested better in my life I slept soundly all night and woke in the morning thoroughly refreshed our first and nights experience on the prairie did not have many hardships. We turned out at the first strak of day and then had a very busy time till we got started, some brought in the horses cleaned and harnessed them others pulled up our tent and packed it and the bed cloths into the wagons, and others were busy preparing the breakfast. At sunrise we were all ready and started across the bluffs directly westward through the plains of Kansas, the road today lay through a very rough rolling country the hills being about two hundred feet high, no sooner on the top of one expecting then to find a good road, but instead we could look down a tremendous steep hill so very abrupt that we were compelled to chain two of the wheels of the wagon to"},{"pageid":64604,"pagefilename":"176543414ea0a98dd0d6f3cf9ea6d168.jpg","transcription":"6\nprevent it from running into the horses. The scenery through this place was very fine the grass was luxurient and green on one side and boundless as the ocean, on the other lay a thick belt of timber which enclosed the Missouri river. The road was thickly strewed with imigrants far as the eye could reach over the rooling hills all rushing on eagerly bound for the same golden country, On account of the rough nature of the roads we made only twenty miles this day and camped at sunset within a few rods of a Kansas farmers house, we purchased from them some warm biscuits and fresh milk and had a supper fit for a king. In the evening the farmer invited us to his house he there was to be a singing school there that night, we had a very mery time of it, there was a good many young folks present we sang some songs together and then a rivalry started between Illinois and Kansas to see which could sing the best songs and in the best style, after a few hours of merry strife we acknowledged the supremacy of the Kansas girls, In the morning we started again on our pilgrimage not feeling so merry and cheerful on account of the previous night's enjoyment, The road  still continued very rough and hard on our animals we were still on the bluffs of the Missouri river which in this place are about twenty five miles wide, Oh the hardship of going up and down those bluffs I shall never forget, we had to double teams going up hill and then take hold of the wagons and help, every ten yards we would block the wheels and take a breathing spell and so on resting at intervels till at last we gained the top feeling very thankful indeed and expecting  at last to find the long promised level land, but bitter disapointment there lay a steep descent and on the othere side another terrific hill it was almost enough to discourage and make us give up in dispair.

On this day we again made only twenty miles owing to the uneven roads, we camped at night foot sore and tired on the banks of a beautiful little stream called Walnut Creek, It was a nice camping place as there was wood water and grass plenty.  I now began to enjoy in earnest the solitary expanse of prairies and the deprivation of the luxuries of cities, After traveling all day over the hot shelterless prairie it was indeed a delightful feeling of repose came over us as we saw in the far distance the long belt of timber which conceals within its green boughs the stream of cool running water, It is as unfailing a sign of water on the western prairies, as the Oasis is to the parched and wearied traveler on the great African Desert.  This night we enjoyed ourselves hugely, had a good meal of stewed rabbits and prairie chickens which we killed during the day, and as the evening was cold we built a rousing fire got out our buffalo skins spread them on the grass all round the fire, and stretched ourselves at full length to rest our weary limbs.  And now commenced the merry part of our voyage the joke, song, and laugh went round as merrily as if it was all a holyday break, and we intirely forgot the solemn fact that there were more hills to be surmounted on the morrow, forgot all the vexations and annoyances of the day and thought only of spending pleasantly the passing hour,  The night was so beautifully calm and clear that we concluded not to set our tent and we set our guard and lay down to sleep in regular Indian style by our camp fire.  The night passed calmly without any annoyance from our horses or what more frequently happens from our fellow travelers.  but I must say that thefts are of very rare"},{"pageid":64606,"pagefilename":"94bef414269f9dcd778eb615067e81db.jpg","transcription":"8\nrare occurrance the inflicting of immediate punishment which is the invariable rule of our society on the plains the offender being caught is instantly tried by a jury picked up on the road the witnesses both for and against are heard and if not proved he is discharged forthwith, if guilty he will be punished according to the enormity of the offense, if for horse or mule stealing or murder, he is hung to the nearest tree, if a less grevious crime he is tied to a tree or wagon wheel and receives from ten to one hundred lashes on the bare back the amount to be fixed by the jury.  The certinty of immediate and severe punishment is a wholesome check to the evil disposed so much so that of late we have not many fears of being annoyed from that source.  On the third day we commenced our journey very early as we had to make thirty miles to the next camping ground, our old enemies the bluffs still surrounded us, and made it tiresome work, about noon to day some antelope came in sight and we had a very exciting time trying to shoot some of them but could not accomplish it, as they were very shy, and we were not acquanted with the manner of hunting them, we afterwards found it out from the Indians, you can take a red hankerchief tie it to your ramrod, and find a low hollow place in the prairie, raise your signal high in your hand, and let it fall quite naturally to the ground keep repeating this signal every two or three minutes, and if there are any antelope within two or three miles they will run towards the signal you have your gun all ready and when they show their heads above the brow of the hill you can shoot them without any trouble if you have a double barrel rifle you will perhaps have a chance to shoot to of them as they generally feed in pairs.  The flesh of the antelope is the finest meat I ever tasted it is nice tender and delicious far ahead of venison.

After ???? interruption we resumed our journey, we passed across several smaller streams this day we travelled about twenty five miles and reached the town of Marysville one hundred miles from St Joe at nightfall. We camped on the banks of the Big Blue river which runs through the town, it is a very nice stream having the peculiar characteristic of all Kansas rivers, viz, about one foot deep twenty wide and clear running water with a gravelly bottom the water is cool and tastes first rate. In the neighborhood of this river the bluffs are almost as high as those on the shore of the Missouri. the town has a very fine site on the bluffs commanding a view of the prairis for miles on every side. It is a place of some imprtance being the last outfitting place for immigrants for Pikes Peak, Utah and California and the residence of the Government Inspector of goods for U.S. troops in the west. the trains are here examined to ascertain that the supplys are all right and to prevent the shipment of any contraband article at the expense of Government. The town has a population of about one thousand and one pretty respectable looking street and some first rate stores a newspaper office Land Office a few lawyers and some doctors. After looking all about the town we packed up and turned again westward our first job was to get across the Big Blue aa very difficult undertaking with our heavily loaded wagon there is a very steep descent of about one hundred feet to the bed of the river in the middle a bed of quicksand and a hill to raise on the other side however we hitched four horses to each wagon and"},{"pageid":64609,"pagefilename":"e12074da9543db248785f854726b353e.jpg","transcription":"11\nwent at it with a will. It was very easy to get down but we stuck fast in the middle and the horses could not budg another inch Joe and myself were standing on the feed box and in getting down to help the horses Joe caught his foot in a rope and dove head first into the stream the water was cold as ice and the morning frosty but there was no pity for him but all had a harty laugh at his expense. I was more fortunate and jumped in without getting any wet the water not being deep and we all wore long miners boots by dint of hard pulling and pushing we succeeded in getting out of the ugly hole but had the same operation to repeat to bring across the other wagon. Once more on the road the aspect of the country was slightly undulating the grass so fine and green it was really a charming sight the boundless prairie far as the eye could reach in every direction I cannot compare it to anything but the ocean. We journeyed on pleasantly without incident of any kind, the weather now was getting pretty warm it was now uncomfortably so there was a high wind blowing the dust rose in clouds and almost blinded us to add to our troubles we met no water during the days travel so that horses and men were almost exhausted. We traveled thirty mile and camped on the Big Sandy river for the night this stream is precilely like the big Blue river only is is some smaller being about ten feet wide.  We camped here for the night the most dirty fitugued looking set of gold hunter you could find on the road between St Joe and Denver City. In the morning we arose fresh as if we had slept on feather beds and resumed our journey we met nothing worth describing on this day the country had about the same appearance as on the previous day we made twenty five miles and camped on the Little Sandy"},{"pageid":64610,"pagefilename":"75a85ea3c2ce1045417e05f973ddff9c.jpg","transcription":"river a beautiful little stream but so small that in any other country it would be called a rivulet. The next day about noon we struck the little Blue River the most singular river I saw in this strange country it is about three hundred miles long about twenty broad and three deep it runs through a level prairie the water even with the surface of the ground the water is a very fine taste and of a deep blue color if you take some up in a glass it has the appearance of having been colored there was plenty of fish swimming about which could plainly be seen through the water. We now met plenty of game ducks [unclear] Rabbits Prairie Chickens in abundance and we fared in most luxurious style. Our road lay parallel with the river and almost along its banks through the day I was charmed with the looks of that beautiful stream, at night we camped on its banks the pretiest camping ground we yet had. After supper we got out our flutes had some music and singing and enjoyed ourselves till a late hour of the night. In the morning we resumed our journey again all day along the banks of the Blue still the same beautiful color in the water the same level prairie on either side at noon we came to a Ranch called Pawnee Ranch I went in to ask some questions of the proprietor but on intering the door was struck dumb on seeing on the counter a human skull with the following inscription on the forehead \"died from asking to many questions\" I drew back again quickly without making any inquiries of the churlish owner I suppose he was much annoyed from travellers and put up this [hedion] warning as an answer to to all who [unclear] by.

This afternoon we also met the Pony Express returning from San Francisco he passed us like the wind and we could not get a single word of news we camped tonight on the Blue River again. The following day at noon we parted from this beautiful little stream having traveled fifty miles along its banks we now struck out on the broad open prairie on  the old military road to California this road has been well worn by travel it is about one hundred feet broad and cut down from the constant rise about one foot its whole width. The whole immigration to and from California in 1848 and 1850 was over this highway it is now a splendid road the peculiar nature of the soil rendering it when exposed to the sun as hard as brick without any assistance from man. It is far ahead of the smoothest Mac Adanized roads in the States a wagon loaded with six to making no impression whatever on its flinty surface tonight we had to camp on the open prairie without wood or water the prospect was not all all encouraging and we could not help contrasting it with our abundance of the night previous of the Little Blue. We pitched our tent and camped on the side of the road picketed our horses and downharted and unhappy we threw ourselves on our blankets to find some rest. This was the first time I began to think of home with many regrets for leaving it all the hardships and difficulties of our undertaking then rose before my mind vividly and I could not help thinking we had sacrificed our good established business the comforts of home and friends to come on this wild goose chase for now in its sober reality I could not consider it in any other light."},{"pageid":64612,"pagefilename":"e45b9dba459fee1054ece2ac80b535e0.jpg","transcription":"So curious is it that no sooner did we realize a small share of hard life than we commence to complain of what we brought [unclear] ourselves knowingly and expecting even worse than what we then experienced.

In the morning we rose very early and were again on the road in about three hours we struck the great Plat River at grand island ten miles below Fort Karney we were so starved out for want of cooked victals that we determined to spend the remainder of the day and night here. The river at this place is about a mile wide having a large green island in the centre, the water will average about one foot in depth all the way a cross it is however very hard for man or horse to cross on account of quicksand indeed you may say the river is nothing more than a moving bed of sand you could no drink it unless you were almost famished with thirst we could not use it untill it lay in a vessel for an hour to settle.On the banks of the river there was a thick belt of Cottonwood timber about one eight mile thick our camp was in this wood shortly after encamping as we were standing on the edge of the river we saw some huge animal moving on the island we soon found that it was a buffalo Joe and Jim took hold of their guns [unclear] into the river and waded across to the island but they could not get within of him it is almost impossible to shoot a single Buffalo they are so cautious.

We now came in sight of Fort Karney and could see the glorious old \"Star spangled banner\" floating proudly on the breeze. The Fort consists of about twenty houses occupied as barracks officers quarters and a Post Office enclosing a square about one acre with twelve six pounder guns mounted three on each side of the square what they were placed there for I could not imagine as they could not fire them off without knocking down the buildings. It is very curious why they selected such a position for a fort it has no natural advantages whatever there isnot any shlter from an enemy no elevation to the ground and it is a mile away from the river and they have not even got a mud enclosure around it and I should think in case of assault the insiders would have no advantage over the besiegers. We were not allowed to stop in the immediate neighborhood of the \"Fort\" the rules being strict that no one should camp within two miles.

The weather was no commencing to get very warm it was on the 5th of May we passed through Karney I fergot to mention that at the other side of the Fort there is quite a town called Karney City it has about thirty hous and a population of perhaps one hundred I suppose the way the inhabitants support themselves is by selling vegatables milk butter & c to the soldiers. The road now lay along the bank of the river sometimes close by the edge of the water and again a mile away from it, the Antelope now came within range frequently and we succeeded in killing a few of them we now lived like princes plenty of the best kind of game with bread, butter, beans, pork salt Dried Apples fish tea and coffee and plenty of wood and water, we felt in such high spirits that a days journey of thirty miles did not tire us in the least. We were now in the Indian country and in the evening they would come round our encampment in swarms asking for food, the poor wretches were really starving they had a long severe winter and as is usually the case failed to lay up anything I have seen them eat a horse that dropped dead on the road. We always gave them the remains of our meals but it only made them clamerous for more of course we could not satisfy them our two wagon loads of provisions if shared among them would not make one meal for the multitudes that surrounded us at every meal and it was the most painful thing I ever experienced to see them watch us as we put the bite to our mouths with a most hungry entreating look.

I have seen them eat a horse that died from hardship and starvation they would tear it with their teeth as ravinously as a pack of wolves. Our guide book now informed us that we had one hundred miles before us without wood of any kind we were obliged to carry a supply with us we chopped down a cottonwood tree took off a log and tied it under our wagons before we started we cooked and laid in what we considered a good supply for three days so that we would not have to use our wood unless for making coffee. All thinks being prepared we started out on this dreary looking desert. In most places it was devoid of grass and what was very strange not a sign of a shrub tree or even a willow the peculiar characteristic of this country being to have timber on its river banks and in no other place. Our horses suffered severely here they had no grass and had to subsist intirely on corn which made them very weak an we were compelled thereby to make very short journeys. We made the hundred miles in five days and then felt rejoiced thinking we were out of the desert but there were no indications of such a happy change we journeyed on day after day for ten days still the same dreary waste nothing to see but river prairie and sky and the sufferings and hardship we endured during that time will remain impressed on my mind forever.

After our supper we looked up good quarters for our poor starved horses we found a place where the grass was splendid and tied them there for the night leaving a watch to look out for their safety we then lay down and had a comfortable nights sleep.

We felt that something must be done and done soon or we should be hemmed in without hope of escape it would be the hight of madness to remain in our present position so we resolved to leave it or provoke the Indians to immediate attack, so ten of our members brought in our horses harnessed them up to the wagons and made all ready for a start the other forty still kept the rifles on the cock and presented at the foe.

But the Indian could perform some astonishing feats on horseback one was riding on one side of his horse so that we who were standing one hundred yards distant could not say whether he was on the horses back or not, another one was laying three stones down on the road, about twenty yards apart and then the Indian would gallop towards them pick up one stone sit erect on his horse again turn over on the side of his horse just holding on by one toe and one hand pick up the second on and so on with the third all done in an instant so fast that the eye could scarcely follow his movements he rode in triumphantly with the three stones in his hands."},{"pageid":64623,"pagefilename":"bfd15edc03dddd2785cf61e21e69ea75.jpg","transcription":"25\nThese Indians appeared to be very friendly and well disposed towards us eager to trade skins and moccasins for anything we might offer them.

In this part of the country were a great many rabbits called here Jackass Rabbits but I am told by people that are well informed on the matter that they are the regular old country hare they are very large we succeeded in killing some and the flesh was excellent, there is a knack in hunting them which if you do not know you could not kill one in a month when one starts up before you you must stand still and then he will stand still also ang sit on his hind legs and face right towards you if he is too far off for a shot advance slowly towards him in a straight line if you go zigzag he will know it at once and start off in this way you can come close enough to shoot him if he does take the alarm and start stop still again"},{"pageid":64624,"pagefilename":"c8df707a855bfcb329cdea9d0168b968.jpg","transcription":"26\nand he will not go far until he stops when you can repeat the same maneuvre again I would never miss killing one that I started unless he might happen to get to his burrow.

The day was remarkably bright and clear and we saw what we at first supposed to be a cloud straight before us to the west after looking for a few minutes I noticed that it did not alter its position in the least and if it was a cloud it must drift in some direction, its appearance was pyramidal and of a bright blue color after watching it about an hour I became convinced that it was the mountains and I afterwards found out that It was Longs Peak about two hundred and fifty miles distant said to be the highest peat of the Rocky Mountains.

Which course,\nhe thought, would be most beneficial for them. Before the expiration\nof this term of Five Years however, the Whites had come in, in great\nnumbers among them and thenceforward there had been much trouble\n\nand confusion. In consequence of this State of things he\n\nhad in the mean time, in accordance with the counsel of friends\ngone to look  a home beyond the Mississippi: during his absence\ngreater troubles had grown up, and more confusion among his\npeople arisen on account of the transfer and sale of their\nreservations, for, on his return he found that the Whites were swindling\n\nthem out of them; on that account he had requested Dr.\n\nMcHenry at that time certifying Agent, to forbear from certifying\n\nto contracts for the Sale of them, for he had discovered"},{"pageid":69807,"pagefilename":"03387821a78fffa6f5ed0d598ffa522b.jpg","transcription":"that it was no uncommon thing for one Indian to be instigated to\nassume the name of, and personate another, and sometimes to sell and\nstand up to be certified to several tracks of Land, of not one of\nwhich he was in reality the owner.

An opportunity being at length\nafforded, he appeared unexpectedly at their meeting and finding Tuskehe=\n=nehaw with them remonstrated with him about the evil course\nhe was pursuing, telling him that the pernicious talks he was making to\nthe Indians, were not his own talks and did not originate with\nhim, but were derived from others of whom he was the dupe, and\nthat if he thus obstinately persever'd in such course it must\nnecessarily end in consequences that would be ruinous, and that\nall would be afflicted with sorrow for.

Beyond doubt it was one of the leading\ncauses of their debasement and misery, and tended infinitely\nto the procreation of mischief and disturbance. He was\ndesirous in the event of their going into Camp that the dealers in\nthe commodity might not be allowed to bring or sell it among them;\nin the absence of the cause they would of course be releived from\nthe banefull and destructive effect.\nAnother subject too, he would also invite attention towards."},{"pageid":69811,"pagefilename":"61ef94bf7425adbd1d66c42c547f1aab.jpg","transcription":"also invite attention towards.

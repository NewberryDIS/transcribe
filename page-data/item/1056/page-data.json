Half the crimes on our globe are committed through ignorance; but there are very few cases in which the ignorance itself is not a crime. This is one of them. We need not be blinded by the designing and interested on the Cherokee question.

It may impress the truth better to begin by mentioning some very peculiar claims of this people to our respect. They are the most enlightened among the Indians. They have produced men of extraordinary diplomatic prowess, as well as mighty warriors. They have also produced another Cadmus, who has created a syllabic alphabet, in which their language is written and printed. They have discarded the uncivilized modes of life and deport themselves and dress as we do. They are excellent farmers. They are nearly all Christians. They are thoroughly acquainted with all their own laws and with all the rights promised to be secured to them by us in our numerous treaties. They keep a keen watch upon their public men. But, above all, they are remarkable for their love of country. Nor Greece nor Rome nor any of the most enlightened nations of either ancients or modern times can exhibit, in their palmiest days, nobler instances of any self-sacrificing devotedness"},{"pageid":71039,"pagefilename":"c5b937eb865afe20edac39d3329ee95e.jpg","transcription":"devotedness to the public good than are, even at this very moment, common among the Cherokees. There is nothing merely accidental or occasional in this character; it is inherent. It has always been their distinction. One of the earliest historians of South Carolina and Georgia, in a work printed in 1777 at London, says of them, \"It may be remarked, that the Cherokees differ, in some respects, from other Indian nations that have wandered from place to place, and fixed their habitations in separate districts. From time immemorial they have had possession of the same Territory, which at present they occupy. They affirm that their forefathers sprung from that ground, or descended from the clouds upon those hills. These lands of their ancestors they value above all things in the world; they venerate the places where their bones lie interred, and esteem it disgraceful, in the highest degree, to relinquish these sacred repositories. The man that would refuse to take the field in defence of these hereditary possessions, is regarded by them as a coward, and treated as an outcast from their nation.\" See Footnote Bartram, the celebrated traveler, in\nFootnote Historical accounts of the rise & progress of the colonies of South Carolina and Georgia, Vol 2, page 201.

It is obvious that such a people could not prove otherwise than extremely sensitive upon the least attempt to dispossess them of any part of the native land which they prized so dearly. No land in the world could equal it in attractiveness to them. With evidence of this their history overflows. I will give an instance from among the anecdotes of the elder Ridge in the large work entitled \"The Indian Tribes of North America.\" The story exhibits a remarkable contrast with that later course which led to his destruction. It describes him in the meridian of his career, as one of the most violent against a sacrifice of his father-land by sale and removal.

The then Principal chief had been tampered with by the United States' government agents. He had been induced to call the people together to deliberate on the question. Trusting to personal popularity, he had concerted with adherents of his own in the council, to appoint a delegation to exchange away the original country for a new one in the west. This he had planned without first obtaining the public consent, \"which the usages of the nation required.\" It had been contrived beforehand that the popular debates should be insidiously turned into a direction favoring the contemplated design. When the discussion had been brought to the desired point, the Principal Chief presented himself before the people, attended by his confidential ministers.

Ridge looked around, expecting some of the elders to reply. \"The old men kept their seats.\" Ridge at length started up. A tempest of indignation was in his voice & countenance.

The Cherokee love of country extinguished the popularity of the traitor chief.

The leading actors in it were General William Macintosh, second Chief of the Creeks, and John Ross, at that time President of the Cherokee National Committee, under the administration of Path Killer, then Cherokee Principal Chief. The affair is interesting. I will give some of the leading particulars of it.\nBefore this event took place, the policy of removing all Indians from within the United States to an ample district west of the Mississippi and without the limits of any state or territory, had been so determined on the part of our government, that there was no longer any delicacy whatever in relation to the means by which it was to be attempted. The Cherokees and their neighbors the Creeks watched all movements on this subject with extreme jealousy. In 1822, congress had, at the instance of Georgia, made certain appropriations and had appointed commissioners, for the purchases of the Cherokee territory. At the following autumnal council of the Cherokees, a resolution was passed \"to hold no treaties with any commissioners of the United States for any cession of lands, the Cherokees being resolved not to dispose of even one foot of ground,\" \"having"},{"pageid":71045,"pagefilename":"e9ec22a79d749d8cd37f336f57a9764c.jpg","transcription":"\"having not more than sufficient for themselves and their posterity.\" Notices of the resolution were sent to the commissioners, assuring them of a cordial reception on any other subject, but of the entire uselessness of putting their government to further expence on this. The commissioners remonstrated. They threatened the chiefs with the indignation of their great father, the President. He would shake the nation off, said the commissioners, if they persisted. About six months after, another attempt of the United States' agents was made to get up a Treaty, but it was equally unsuccessful. Notwithstanding these defeats, at the autumnal council of 1823, it was understood that the very commissioners who had been repelled before, were to attend at the Council Ground for the purpose of pressing for at Treaty. The council, of course, excited unusual interest. It was understood that the Creek Chief Macintosh, with some attendant chiefs of the same nation, would be present. Preparations were made to receive them with suitable distinction. Macintosh had obtained the confidence of the Cherokees. He was always welcomed among them as a brother. He would attend their regular councils, sometimes as a guest, sometimes to examine into complaints of"},{"pageid":71046,"pagefilename":"226162a8e67325dd6a610df89737b335.jpg","transcription":"of aggressions from his own nation; and before his own nation he was appointed to represent the rights of the Cherokees. According to an Indian custom in such cases, they bestowed upon him the honorary title of chief of the Cherokees. They even strengthened it with the epithet of \"the beloved chief.\" It was well known that there was a great spirit of speculation afloat among the government agents superintending the Creeks, but no suspicion as yet attached to Macintosh, though it was believed some of the Creek Chiefs had been tampered with.\nI have already mentioned that John Ross was then President of the National Committee; a body answering to our Senate. He was even at that early day thoroughly possessed of the confidence of the Cherokees and his popularity was known to our government, as well as to Macintosh. Soon after the arrival of Macintosh, he sent a letter to John Ross. At the contents, Ross was astonished. He held a private conference with some of his associate representatives. It was determined that Major Ridge and Mr McCoy should see Macintosh confidentially and endeavour to gather from him whether the course he had taken was with the knowledge and sanction of the United"},{"pageid":71047,"pagefilename":"a3453a0d02b0e868270a274e4d2dc274.jpg","transcription":"United States' agents. They found it was with their sanction. Macintosh added, that, if it were the desire of Major Ridge & Mr McCoy, he would himself attend the two houses, and address them in favor of a compliance with the views of the Commissioners. He averred that he was certain, if the Committee would fall in with his views, and say they despaired of being able any longer to hold out against the United States, the Principal Chief, old Path Killer, could readily be brought to yield, and so the business would be done. He concluded by attempting to dazzle them with a display of the vast advantages he had gained by former treaties, for himself and others, all knowledge of which was forever buried.\nA secret meeting of the Committee was called early the next morning. This was on the 24th of October, 1823. The letter & the result of the interview were laid before them. It was resolved that the Committee and Council should be instantly convened, to meet in General Council, on special and important business.

The aged Chief of the Council, then over seventy, -- tall, dignified, and rendered the more interesting by a dash of feebleness from severe rheumatism, had an expression of deep thought in his gravity, which made Macintosh cower before his piercing eye.\nMr Ross arose, and addressed the assembly as follows: \"My friends, Five years have elapsed since I have been called to preside over the National Committee; and your approbation of my conduct in the discharge of my official duties is manifested by the successive re-appointments which you have bestowed upon me.

He expressed his astonishment, his deep grief; -- he mourned that he had been mistaken in one he valued as an honest chief; -- he mourned still more that he had been mistaken in one he had, till that moment, confided in as a devoted brother. But all affection must expire before such a breach of trust. He referred the course to be adopted to the General Council, only reminding them that treachery must never be overlooked.\nMacintosh, having somewhat regained his self-possession, arose, to stammer out a lame reply. It was broken and agitated.

He bade him never again to raise his voice in the councils of this nation. He told him he was deposed as a Cherokee Chief and bade him quit the white bench forever.\nMacintosh left the Council Ground with out delay. He seemed anxious and uneasy. He ordered his horse at once. He rose twenty fie miles that night, to his father-in-law's, at  Etowa. The following day he rode his horse sixty miles on his way homeward, and killed it with the fatigue.

Though not immediately relating to the particular Indians I have undertaken to describe, it may not be uninteresting if I digress a moment to state that the Cherokee prophecy with which this epistle closes was soon fulfilled: In February, 1825, Macintosh and other Creek Chiefs made a Treaty with the United States contrary to the will of their nation. The universal Indian penalty for such an act is outlawry; the red man exacts the death of any one so offending by the hand of any true friend to his country. Three hundred Creeks, headed by Menawee, went on the night of the 29th of April, 1825, to the abode of Macintosh, ordered the other inmates to save themselves, that Macintosh and three Chiefs who"},{"pageid":71055,"pagefilename":"a7cf44a5087315c02119eec65029bf76.jpg","transcription":"Chiefs who had been associated with him in the treason and fired his dwelling.

The younger Ridge, through the influence of his father, accompanied the Creek delegation who made this Treaty. He managed their business, acted as their Secretary and, in that capacity, appears as one of the signers. See Footnote The Treaty thus formed and signed by John Ridge, Menawee and others, opens with the following memorable preamble: See Footnote \"Whereas a treaty was concluded at the Indian Springs, on the twelfth day of February last, between commissioners on the part of the United States and a portion of the Creek nation, by which an extensive district of country was ceded to the United States: And whereas a great majority of the chiefs and warriors of the said nation have protested against the execution of the said treaty, and have represented that the same was signed on their part by persons having no sufficient authority\nFootnote Indian Treaties, Washington, 1837, pages 394 & 5.\nFootnote Ibid, page 391."},{"pageid":71056,"pagefilename":"2c82f8889451a31473e9ff2586e6f5c3.jpg","transcription":"authority to form treaties or to make cessions, and that the stipulations in the said treaty, are, therefore, wholly void.

The story of Macintosh in the preceding chapter, has incidentally called up the Indian law against traitors who sell their country without authority. Though I have mentioned it in connection with the Creeks, I have stated that it was a general law, and not confined to any particular Indians. There is further evidence to this effect among the Seminoles, who, in the same way the Creeks had done, executed a traitor chief of theirs, previous to the present war. But it may be supposed, from the extraordinary love of country among the Cherokees,"},{"pageid":71058,"pagefilename":"7c9599f28da6f22d8c9d5186fc4eb347.jpg","transcription":"Cherokees, that such a law would be held even in more honor with them than all other red men. So it ever was. There are very impressive proofs of this, which I will name.\n7. The zeal of the elder Ridge in once defeating the intrigues to warp his people from their patriotism, has been already mentioned. There occurs in his early history a second instance of the acts of his more Roman days. It is described with strong panegyric in the account supplied by his son for the work already quoted, on \"The Indian Tribes of North America.\" The anecdote I mean is of the death of Doublehead, a great Cherokee orator, who, in 1806, when attended by a regular delegation, made a Treaty which the bulk of the Cherokees considered as contravening their instructions. In this Treaty Doublehead had secured a reservation for himself & a few friends of about ten miles square, in the region now including the Alabama town of Florence. He had proceeded, with the rest, to parcel out the reservation & sell it to the whites. This aggravated the public exasperation. His offence was not punished, but it was not forgotten. When a new encroachment was sought soon afterwards, the people believed that Doublehead meant to favor it. He had gone to the neighborhood of the site where Calhoun now stands, to meet the United States Commissioners on the subject. The elder Ridge and"},{"pageid":71059,"pagefilename":"c7495c3c97a0144db75a7c3785f4364a.jpg","transcription":"and another CHerokee by the name of Sanders, determined to defeat his plot by destroying him as a speculator upon the national lands and no friend to his country. They followed him to the place of conference. They joined him in a log tavern kept by a Cherokee, where he and others were carousing. In the midst of the tumult of half drunken? voices, some one caught up the candle from a table and held it near the face of Doublehead. Major Ridge darted silently behind the candle, blew it out and at the same moment shot Doublehead through the cheek, near the lower part of the ear. He fell. There was suddenly great confusion, rendered greater by the darkness. All ran out, exclaiming \"Who did it? Who did it?\" But none could learn at the moment who did it. The Cherokee log tavern-keeper closed and barred the door. It was found that Doublehead had only been wounded; though it was a severe wound. The log-tavern keeper in the night obtained the assistance of two or three men, and they removed Doublehead and thrust him through a window into the tavern keeper's dwelling house. One Mr Black, a schoolmaster, lived about two hundred yards off. It was thought safest to remove Doublehead thither"},{"pageid":71060,"pagefilename":"f6628ce08d624cf17f2cbac84284e375.jpg","transcription":"thither. The executioners were early on the alert. They sought everywhere. They were presently joined by a party demanding revenge upon Doublehead for having shot a Cherokee on his way thither, in a political quarrel, during which the former had resented a taunt upon his treachery. At length the place of Doublehead's concealment was discovered. Sanders; the colleague of Major Ridge, rushed, with the rest, slily and suddenly into the room where he was in a slumber. Their approach startled him. He sprang up, drew a dirk, caught at a pistol. Rising, the sheet clung to his limbs and clogged his heels. Sanders planted a tomahawk in his skull. The others fell on him and chopped his head to pieces. The death of Doublehead passed without a question and he was buried without a tear, because, observed the Indians, the act of Major Ridge and Sanders was considered by the best men of the nation as just retribution by patriots upon a traitor. John Ridge, in the account given by him of his father to the historian of \"The Indian Tribes of North America\" represents that \"a decree having been privately made that Doublehead should be put to death, Major Ridge"},{"pageid":71061,"pagefilename":"0429d276f8971fcd9ae38f99acd52add.jpg","transcription":"Major Ridge was chosen to perform the office of executioner, which he boldly discharged, by going with a few followers to Doublehead's house, and killing him in the midst of his family; after which he addressed the crowd who were drawn together by this act of violence, and explained his authority and his reasons.\" I have good grounds for believing that my own narrative is the more correct of the two; though, from the Cherokee character I doubt if any among them would dissent from the opinion which John Ridge adds to his account, that \"the act was justified by the demerits of the victim and the patriotic motives of him who was the avenger.\"\n8. The Cherokee veneration for the law against those who made arrangements in the name of the nation without being duly authorised, did not rest exclusively with such Cherokees as continued in their ancient possessions. It extended to the west. There it still exists. There it was seen on record within a very short time, by one of the old settlers who himself told me of it. There, in 1828, it was very near producing serious troubles to a party who had negotiated terms with the United States government, which the"},{"pageid":71062,"pagefilename":"3a62a39b8516e35a88d6d5d350377038.jpg","transcription":"which the people in general did not consider as justified by their instructions. The delegates had exchanged away the nation's first territory in the west, for the less acceptable one where they now are, and had made other conditions equally unsatisfactory. Dutch and John Smith, who have recently espoused the petty faction of agitators against the people, then made themselves the soul of the offended majority. They pursued the delegates, one of whom was John Rogers, now one of their co-adjutors. A western Cherokee at present in the delegation opposed to Rogers, screened him from becoming a victim to the ancient law, by threatening retaliation, if he were harmed, upon the National Committee under whose secret authorization his friends said he had acted. Dutch, in disgust at the whole affair, withdrew with forty followers to Red River; and others whom it had equally annoyed, went into Texas.\n9. Perhaps not the least offensive clause of the disliked treaty of the Western Cherokees; -- a clause as disagreable to the Eastern as to the Western citizens; -- was the passage which insidiously provided"},{"pageid":71063,"pagefilename":"e718f8f526650fcb3f3745b02a4f941e.jpg","transcription":"provided for draining the east, by all sorts of artful enticements, of its Cherokee populations. Collaterally with this decoy, arose the prospective law of Georgia, extending her jurisdiction over the Cherokee lands in her vicinage; and the attempt thus to drown the Cherokee government and constitution in a deluge of encroaching power, naturally increased a thousandfold the nation's jealousy of the disaffected within her borders. The Cherokees of the east now began to talk about the ancient law, at which those who had offended among the emigrants were already trembling in the west. Elias Boudinot was then editor of the Cherokee Phoenix and John Ridge was a stirring politician. They were both strenous for the re-proclamation of the law. They demanded that it should be put in writing, which it never yet had been. John Ridge did put it in writing. In the Cherokee Phoenix of October 28, 1829, Elias Boudinot announces the fact as having occurred on \"Saturday, Oct: 24.\" \"On motion\" says he \"of Choonughee of Chickamauga District, an old law, making death the penalty for selling any lands in treaty, without the authority of the nation, was committed to writing.

I love your lives, and wish our people to increase on the land of our fathers.

Presently a man steps forward voluntarily, or by solicitation, as a leader. He walks around the fire in the centre of the house, a time or two, and invites the others to join him. Sometimes a keg with a skin stretched over it, is struck a few times, as a signal. The leader now commences singing and stamping in quick time, and in this manner prances around the fire, followed by some others, who imitate his movements, and answer in a short chorus, which causes the vocal performance to resemble a boat-song: this is the"},{"pageid":71095,"pagefilename":"e2e3e71ffac60bb7ea8329d74bbe93bd.jpg","transcription":"the mode pursued in all songs where dancing is performed. In a short time these are joined by one or two women, who have the shells of terrapins, (land turtles,) with small pebbles in them, fastened to their legs. the clatter made by these in stamping, completes the concert.\nStamping with one or both feet at a time, in quick succession, constitutes the Cherokee mode of dancing. Any person wishing to dance, may now fall in ranks. Generally, an equal number of males & females are engaged at the same time; but strict regularity is not considered necessary.\nThe men and women do not dance alongside, or fronting, each other; but invariably preserve 'Indian file.' The rear is commonly filled up with boys and girls, who are thus initiated into the art at an early age. The leader generally sings extempore: the air is a combination of high and low sounds, used in quick succession, with but few variations, which renders it disagreable and monotonous. He relates his love adventures,-- misfortunes or triumphs;-- boasts of his manhood, influence with the fair sex, and dexterity in various performances. If he be an old man, he"},{"pageid":71096,"pagefilename":"11864a07aa54a4a512b5ae20e2af9ed3.jpg","transcription":"he relates with enthusiasm, the adventures of his youth,-- the exploits which characterised his movements in the field of battle, and the hair-breadth escapes through which he passed; he also boasts of stealing. He makes a great many grotesque motions and contortions;-- slaps his hands together, and raises them alternately,-- one above the other,-- all the while turning and twisting, and bowing ludicrously.-- The motions and gestures of the leader are repeated by his followers; and sometimes they are simultaneous with his,-- for by much practice they are enabled to anticipate him. Any person can commence or leave off dancing, at pleasure. Frequently, a large concourse of people are engaged at the same time. Towards the close of the dance they interlock hands, and represent the figure of a serpent in its coil; and often, the whim of the leader, causes him to make almost as many turnings and windings, and excentric evolutions, as are laid down in a figure of the walls of Troy. As the line of dancers is considerable in length, his [the leader's] sudden retrograde movements never fail in producing confusion, and the dance ends precipitately, with bursts"},{"pageid":71097,"pagefilename":"527dbe4b21b378eac4e512acab4775e0.jpg","transcription":"bursts of laughter, hallooing and yelling. Repetitions of this dance, conducted by different leaders,-- drinking whiskey,-- sensuality, quarrelling and fighting, consume the night.\nWoman's Dance.\nThis is of more rare occurrence than the preceding, and is brought about in the same manner. When the hour of dancing arrives, an old man, (generally the oldest in the clan, or town,) commences singing a dirge-like air, and beating time on a skin stretched over the end of a keg. Like all Cherokee airs, it does not possess much variety; some parts, however, are a little touching, and add somewhat to the gloomy feelings produced by surrounding objects, on the mind of one accustomed to civilized society. Before the old man has spent much time in tuning his pipes, two or three women come forward, with terrapin shells on their legs, and keep time by stamping,-- moving around the fire with peculiar facility, and apparent ease: in a short time most of the women present, join in the dance. This ceremony is"},{"pageid":71098,"pagefilename":"94b3cdfb4e644080658bfca7a28e49a1.jpg","transcription":"is continued as long as the whim of the old man prompts him to sing. After resting half an hour, or an hour, the singing is commenced again, by the same, or another old man, and the dancers again enter the lists.\nIf all other Indian tribes dance like the Cherokees, some writers have greatly misrepresented them. There is no variety in the movement of their feet; stamping with one or both feet at a time, in rapid succession; and, when stationary, jumping up and alighting on both feet in the same quick manner, constitute their only steps in dancing. The night is generally wound up with a common dance;-- and the same coil habits are indulged.\nBeaver Dance.\nThis ceremony originated in the celebration of a Beaver hunt, and it is said the skin of that animal was,  in former times, exclusively used at the dance. But at the present day, owing, I suppose, to the scarcity of Beavers, the Cherokees"},{"pageid":71099,"pagefilename":"5f136ebb2f8be7051c6d521bf9c209a2.jpg","transcription":"Cherokees substitute the skin of some other small animal; but the ceremony is denominated a Beaver Dance.\nEvery person who intends to join in the dance, procures a short stick or club;-- both men and women thus prepared, commence a common dance, or something very much resembling it. Previous to the commencement of the dance, or immediately after, an old man takes a rope twelve or fifteen feet in length, with the skin tied to it. Taking an end in each hand, and throwing the centre over a peg driven into the ground for the purpose, (the floor of an Indian dance house is always natural,) he stands prepared to give the skin a rapid movement by pulling the ends of the rope alternately, in quick succession. After dancing half an hour or more, a man and woman leave the ranks, and approach the skin with brandished weapons;-- the man goes foremost, (as is usual on all occasions,) and steadying himself, endeavours to give the skin a blow: having now performed his part, he throws down his stick and retires. The woman performs the same.

This appears to be a very frivolous pastime, and yet they seem to take great delight in it. The remainder of the night is spent in common dances, and intemperance with its concomitants.\nEagle Dance.\nThis ceremony is of rare occurrence, and it is said that the capture of an Eagle gave rise to it: ever after, a similar event continued to be celebrated in the same manner. Now, as in the Beaver Dance, this is performed without the occurrence of such a circumstance. Like most animals possessing a native nobleness, the Eagles have mostly deserted the boundaries of civilisation, and"},{"pageid":71101,"pagefilename":"efc960f3c4fb896dd84b6880c015117c.jpg","transcription":"and sought, in the deep recesses of the forest, society and scenery more congenial to their nature. But to keep up the appearance of reality, some Eagle feathers are preserved by some person in the town, or clan, to be used at the ceremony.\nOwing to the peculiarities and eccentricities attending the performance, and its rare occurrence, the Council House is generally crowded.\nThe performers are chosen from amongst the most athletic and active young men. These, a short time after night, convene a small distance from the house, and strip and paint themselves in a similar manner to ball players; and also decorate their heads with feathers,-- and arrange themselves in files, of from four to six deep: the arrangement is something like a platoon of soldiers. At this ceremony, and at ballplays, when they first go forward to meet each other at the centre, appear to be the only occasions in which the Indians dispense with single file. The long, shrill, war-whoop is now sounded by every one of the performers simultaneously: immediately after which, they set forward at quick time, dancing, and answering in"},{"pageid":71102,"pagefilename":"d72e29e76871fd303a663d5f1e66488e.jpg","transcription":"in a short chorus to the singing of some person appointed for that purpose. Although the motions of their feet are quick, they proceed at a slow rate, by mincing their steps. They halt frequently; and before setting off again, the dismal warwhoop stuns the ears of those unaccustomed to it, with deafening shrillness. Thus they proceed until they reach the interior of the house. They now seat themselves, and join in a song peculiar to the dance. Shortly after this is finished, an old man bounces up with a hatchet or club in his hand, and relates the adventures of his youth, apparently with much warmth of feeling. As there are but few warriors in the nation, (those who have been engaged in warfare,) the patriarchs are constrained to resort to fiction, and, according to my interpreters, relate many fabulous anecdotes. After speaking a short time, the old man breaks off his oration, and commences singing and dancing,-- at the close of which, he flourishes his hatchet or club over the performers. This interlude finished, he commences again the relation of his exploits. These different"},{"pageid":71103,"pagefilename":"36f332127e2263f8a4159452128c2b20.jpg","transcription":"different movements are sometimes repeated three or four times.

They represent mendicant travellers on a long journey; and their raiment and other equipments, remind me of the crafty Gibeonites, who appeared before Joshua as ambassadors from a distant land. I doubt whether Garrick ever acted a part on the English stage, more in conformity to nature and reality, than I have seen low-life, decrepitude and old age, acted by young Cherokees disguised in a rude dance-house: Some person advances & asks them various questions;-- Where they are from? -- Where are they going? &c.

It consists in a trembling or rapid vibration of the muscles, and, at the same time, a regular and brisk movement forward, requiring the utmost exertion of muscular power. But the sport appears to depend mostly upon a variety of obscene gestures and movements, which will not bear a description. The remainder of the night is spent in common dance, &c.

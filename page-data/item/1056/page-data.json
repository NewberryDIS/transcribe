They have produced men of extraordinary diplomatic prowess, as well as mighty warriors. They have also produced another Cadmus, who has created a syllabic alphabet, in which their language is written and printed. They have discarded the uncivilized modes of life and deport themselves and dress as we do. They are excellent farmers. They are nearly all Christians. They are thoroughly acquainted with all their own laws and with all the rights promised to be secured to them by us in our numerous treaties. They keep a keen watch upon their public men. But, above all, they are remarkable for their love of country.

There is nothing merely accidental or occasional in this character; it is inherent. It has always been their distinction. One of the earliest historians of South Carolina and Georgia, in a work printed in 1777 at London, says of them, \"It may be remarked, that the Cherokees differ, in some respects, from other Indian nations that have wandered from place to place, and fixed their habitations in separate districts. From time immemorial they have had possession of the same Territory, which at present they occupy. They affirm that their forefathers sprung from that ground, or descended from the clouds upon those hills. These lands of their ancestors they value above all things in the world; they venerate the places where their bones lie interred, and esteem it disgraceful, in the highest degree, to relinquish these sacred repositories. The man that would refuse to take the field in defence of these hereditary possessions, is regarded by them as a coward, and treated as an outcast from their nation.\" See Footnote Bartram, the celebrated traveler, in\nFootnote Historical accounts of the rise & progress of the colonies of South Carolina and Georgia, Vol 2, page 201.

It is obvious that such a people could not prove otherwise than extremely sensitive upon the least attempt to dispossess them of any part of the native land which they prized so dearly. No land in the world could equal it in attractiveness to them. With evidence of this their history overflows. I will give an instance from among the anecdotes of the elder Ridge in the large work entitled \"The Indian Tribes of North America.\" The story exhibits a remarkable contrast with that later course which led to his destruction. It describes him in the meridian of his career, as one of the most violent against a sacrifice of his father-land by sale and removal.

This he had planned without first obtaining the public consent, \"which the usages of the nation required.\" It had been contrived beforehand that the popular debates should be insidiously turned into a direction favoring the contemplated design. When the discussion had been brought to the desired point, the Principal Chief presented himself before the people, attended by his confidential ministers.

The Cherokee love of country extinguished the popularity of the traitor chief.

The leading actors in it were General William Macintosh, second Chief of the Creeks, and John Ross, at that time President of the Cherokee National Committee, under the administration of Path Killer, then Cherokee Principal Chief. The affair is interesting. I will give some of the leading particulars of it.\nBefore this event took place, the policy of removing all Indians from within the United States to an ample district west of the Mississippi and without the limits of any state or territory, had been so determined on the part of our government, that there was no longer any delicacy whatever in relation to the means by which it was to be attempted. The Cherokees and their neighbors the Creeks watched all movements on this subject with extreme jealousy. In 1822, congress had, at the instance of Georgia, made certain appropriations and had appointed commissioners, for the purchases of the Cherokee territory. At the following autumnal council of the Cherokees, a resolution was passed \"to hold no treaties with any commissioners of the United States for any cession of lands, the Cherokees being resolved not to dispose of even one foot of ground,\" \"having"},{"pageid":71045,"pagefilename":"e9ec22a79d749d8cd37f336f57a9764c.jpg","transcription":"\"having not more than sufficient for themselves and their posterity.\" Notices of the resolution were sent to the commissioners, assuring them of a cordial reception on any other subject, but of the entire uselessness of putting their government to further expence on this. The commissioners remonstrated. They threatened the chiefs with the indignation of their great father, the President. He would shake the nation off, said the commissioners, if they persisted. About six months after, another attempt of the United States' agents was made to get up a Treaty, but it was equally unsuccessful. Notwithstanding these defeats, at the autumnal council of 1823, it was understood that the very commissioners who had been repelled before, were to attend at the Council Ground for the purpose of pressing for at Treaty. The council, of course, excited unusual interest. It was understood that the Creek Chief Macintosh, with some attendant chiefs of the same nation, would be present. Preparations were made to receive them with suitable distinction. Macintosh had obtained the confidence of the Cherokees. He was always welcomed among them as a brother. He would attend their regular councils, sometimes as a guest, sometimes to examine into complaints of"},{"pageid":71046,"pagefilename":"226162a8e67325dd6a610df89737b335.jpg","transcription":"of aggressions from his own nation; and before his own nation he was appointed to represent the rights of the Cherokees. According to an Indian custom in such cases, they bestowed upon him the honorary title of chief of the Cherokees. They even strengthened it with the epithet of \"the beloved chief.\" It was well known that there was a great spirit of speculation afloat among the government agents superintending the Creeks, but no suspicion as yet attached to Macintosh, though it was believed some of the Creek Chiefs had been tampered with.\nI have already mentioned that John Ross was then President of the National Committee; a body answering to our Senate. He was even at that early day thoroughly possessed of the confidence of the Cherokees and his popularity was known to our government, as well as to Macintosh. Soon after the arrival of Macintosh, he sent a letter to John Ross. At the contents, Ross was astonished. He held a private conference with some of his associate representatives. It was determined that Major Ridge and Mr McCoy should see Macintosh confidentially and endeavour to gather from him whether the course he had taken was with the knowledge and sanction of the United"},{"pageid":71047,"pagefilename":"a3453a0d02b0e868270a274e4d2dc274.jpg","transcription":"United States' agents. They found it was with their sanction. Macintosh added, that, if it were the desire of Major Ridge & Mr McCoy, he would himself attend the two houses, and address them in favor of a compliance with the views of the Commissioners. He averred that he was certain, if the Committee would fall in with his views, and say they despaired of being able any longer to hold out against the United States, the Principal Chief, old Path Killer, could readily be brought to yield, and so the business would be done. He concluded by attempting to dazzle them with a display of the vast advantages he had gained by former treaties, for himself and others, all knowledge of which was forever buried.\nA secret meeting of the Committee was called early the next morning. This was on the 24th of October, 1823. The letter & the result of the interview were laid before them. It was resolved that the Committee and Council should be instantly convened, to meet in General Council, on special and important business.

He expressed his astonishment, his deep grief; -- he mourned that he had been mistaken in one he valued as an honest chief; -- he mourned still more that he had been mistaken in one he had, till that moment, confided in as a devoted brother. But all affection must expire before such a breach of trust. He referred the course to be adopted to the General Council, only reminding them that treachery must never be overlooked.\nMacintosh, having somewhat regained his self-possession, arose, to stammer out a lame reply.

He bade him never again to raise his voice in the councils of this nation. He told him he was deposed as a Cherokee Chief and bade him quit the white bench forever.\nMacintosh left the Council Ground with out delay. He seemed anxious and uneasy. He ordered his horse at once. He rose twenty five miles that night, to his father-in-law's, at  Etowa. The following day he rode his horse sixty miles on his way homeward, and killed it with the fatigue.

Though not immediately relating to the particular Indians I have undertaken to describe, it may not be uninteresting if I digress a moment to state that the Cherokee prophecy with which this epistle closes was soon fulfilled: In February, 1825, Macintosh and other Creek Chiefs made a Treaty with the United States contrary to the will of their nation. The universal Indian penalty for such an act is outlawry; the red man exacts the death of any one so offending by the hand of any true friend to his country. Three hundred Creeks, headed by Menawee, went on the night of the 29th of April, 1825, to the abode of Macintosh, ordered the other inmates to save themselves, that Macintosh and three Chiefs who"},{"pageid":71055,"pagefilename":"a7cf44a5087315c02119eec65029bf76.jpg","transcription":"Chiefs who had been associated with him in the treason and fired his dwelling.

The younger Ridge, through the influence of his father, accompanied the Creek delegation who made this Treaty. He managed their business, acted as their Secretary and, in that capacity, appears as one of the signers. See Footnote The Treaty thus formed and signed by John Ridge, Menawee and others, opens with the following memorable preamble: See Footnote \"Whereas a treaty was concluded at the Indian Springs, on the twelfth day of February last, between commissioners on the part of the United States and a portion of the Creek nation, by which an extensive district of country was ceded to the United States: And whereas a great majority of the chiefs and warriors of the said nation have protested against the execution of the said treaty, and have represented that the same was signed on their part by persons having no sufficient authority\nFootnote Indian Treaties, Washington, 1837, pages 394 & 5.\nFootnote Ibid, page 391."},{"pageid":71056,"pagefilename":"2c82f8889451a31473e9ff2586e6f5c3.jpg","transcription":"authority to form treaties or to make cessions, and that the stipulations in the said treaty, are, therefore, wholly void.

The story of Macintosh in the preceding chapter, has incidentally called up the Indian law against traitors who sell their country without authority. Though I have mentioned it in connection with the Creeks, I have stated that it was a general law, and not confined to any particular Indians. There is further evidence to this effect among the Seminoles, who, in the same way the Creeks had done, executed a traitor chief of theirs, previous to the present war.

The zeal of the elder Ridge in once defeating the intrigues to warp his people from their patriotism, has been already mentioned. There occurs in his early history a second instance of the acts of his more Roman days. It is described with strong panegyric in the account supplied by his son for the work already quoted, on \"The Indian Tribes of North America.\" The anecdote I mean is of the death of Doublehead, a great Cherokee orator, who, in 1806, when attended by a regular delegation, made a Treaty which the bulk of the Cherokees considered as contravening their instructions. In this Treaty Doublehead had secured a reservation for himself & a few friends of about ten miles square, in the region now including the Alabama town of Florence. He had proceeded, with the rest, to parcel out the reservation & sell it to the whites. This aggravated the public exasperation. His offence was not punished, but it was not forgotten. When a new encroachment was sought soon afterwards, the people believed that Doublehead meant to favor it. He had gone to the neighborhood of the site where Calhoun now stands, to meet the United States Commissioners on the subject. The elder Ridge and"},{"pageid":71059,"pagefilename":"c7495c3c97a0144db75a7c3785f4364a.jpg","transcription":"and another Cherokee by the name of Sanders, determined to defeat his plot by destroying him as a speculator upon the national lands and no friend to his country. They followed him to the place of conference. They joined him in a log tavern kept by a Cherokee, where he and others were carousing. In the midst of the tumult of half drunken? voices, some one caught up the candle from a table and held it near the face of Doublehead. Major Ridge darted silently behind the candle, blew it out and at the same moment shot Doublehead through the cheek, near the lower part of the ear. He fell. There was suddenly great confusion, rendered greater by the darkness. All ran out, exclaiming \"Who did it? Who did it?\" But none could learn at the moment who did it. The Cherokee log tavern-keeper closed and barred the door. It was found that Doublehead had only been wounded; though it was a severe wound. The log-tavern keeper in the night obtained the assistance of two or three men, and they removed Doublehead and thrust him through a window into the tavern keeper's dwelling house.

They were presently joined by a party demanding revenge upon Doublehead for having shot a Cherokee on his way thither, in a political quarrel, during which the former had resented a taunt upon his treachery. At length the place of Doublehead's concealment was discovered. Sanders; the colleague of Major Ridge, rushed, with the rest, slily and suddenly into the room where he was in a slumber. Their approach startled him. He sprang up, drew a dirk, caught at a pistol. Rising, the sheet clung to his limbs and clogged his heels. Sanders planted a tomahawk in his skull. The others fell on him and chopped his head to pieces. The death of Doublehead passed without a question and he was buried without a tear, because, observed the Indians, the act of Major Ridge and Sanders was considered by the best men of the nation as just retribution by patriots upon a traitor.

The Cherokee veneration for the law against those who made arrangements in the name of the nation without being duly authorised, did not rest exclusively with such Cherokees as continued in their ancient possessions. It extended to the west. There it still exists. There it was seen on record within a very short time, by one of the old settlers who himself told me of it. There, in 1828, it was very near producing serious troubles to a party who had negotiated terms with the United States government, which the"},{"pageid":71062,"pagefilename":"3a62a39b8516e35a88d6d5d350377038.jpg","transcription":"which the people in general did not consider as justified by their instructions. The delegates had exchanged away the nation's first territory in the west, for the less acceptable one where they now are, and had made other conditions equally unsatisfactory. Dutch and John Smith, who have recently espoused the petty faction of agitators against the people, then made themselves the soul of the offended majority. They pursued the delegates, one of whom was John Rogers, now one of their co-adjutors. A western Cherokee at present in the delegation opposed to Rogers, screened him from becoming a victim to the ancient law, by threatening retaliation, if he were harmed, upon the National Committee under whose secret authorization his friends said he had acted. Dutch, in disgust at the whole affair, withdrew with forty followers to Red River; and others whom it had equally annoyed, went into Texas.\n9. Perhaps not the least offensive clause of the disliked treaty of the Western Cherokees; -- a clause as disagreable to the Eastern as to the Western citizens; -- was the passage which insidiously provided"},{"pageid":71063,"pagefilename":"e718f8f526650fcb3f3745b02a4f941e.jpg","transcription":"provided for draining the east, by all sorts of artful enticements, of its Cherokee populations. Collaterally with this decoy, arose the prospective law of Georgia, extending her jurisdiction over the Cherokee lands in her vicinage; and the attempt thus to drown the Cherokee government and constitution in a deluge of encroaching power, naturally increased a thousandfold the nation's jealousy of the disaffected within her borders. The Cherokees of the east now began to talk about the ancient law, at which those who had offended among the emigrants were already trembling in the west. Elias Boudinot was then editor of the Cherokee Phoenix and John Ridge was a stirring politician. They were both strenous for the re-proclamation of the law. They demanded that it should be put in writing, which it never yet had been. John Ridge did put it in writing. In the Cherokee Phoenix of October 28, 1829, Elias Boudinot announces the fact as having occurred on \"Saturday, Oct: 24.\" \"On motion\" says he \"of Choonughee of Chickamauga District, an old law, making death the penalty for selling any lands in treaty, without the authority of the nation, was committed to writing.

Womankiller, of Hickory Log District, who is probably more than eighty years of age, rose and spoke substantially as follows, in reference to the bill: \"My children, Permit me to call you so, as I am an old man, who has lived a long time, watching the well being of this nation. I love your lives, and wish our people to increase on the land of our fathers. The bill before you is to punish wicked men who may arise to cede away our country contrary to the consent of the Council. It is a good law--it will not kill the innocent, but the guilty. I feel the importance of the subject, and am glad the law has been suggested. My companions, men of renown, in Council, who now sleep in the dust, spoke the same language, and I now stand on the verge of the grave, to bear witness to their love of country. My sun of existence is fast approaching towards its setting and my aged bones will soon be laid under ground, and I wish them laid in the bosom of this earth we have received from our fathers, who had it from the Great Being above.

I am, indeed, told, that the government of the United States will spoil their treaties with us and sink our National Council under their feet. It may be so, but it shall not be with our consent, nor by the misconduct of our people. We hold them by the golden chain of friendship, made when our friendship was worth a price, and if they act the tyrant and kill us for our lands, we shall, in a state of unoffending innocence, sleep with the thousands of our departed people. My feeble limbs will not allow me to stand longer. I can say no more, but, before I sit, allow me to tell you that I am in favor of the bill\".\n10. This striking speech was carefully translated by John ridge and published in the Cherokee Phoenix by Elias Boudinot. The law itself was also published there soon afterwards.

In the same sense, Cherokee village is to be understood.

Sometimes it is caught in its descent; but he who catches it, is frequently seized by some person at his back, who throws his heels in the air and his head and shoulders to the ground, and the ball is taken from him. Often when his adversary is in the act of raising him up for the purpose of prostrating him violently, he contrives to throw the ball a considerable distance towards his end of the ball ground.

Although every man has his adversary, yet it does not prevent them from encountering indiscriminately. Sometimes eight or ten or more couples, are engaged in personal conflicts, each individual striving in the most vigorous and adroit manner to gain the mastery. A stranger will shudder to see the violent manner in which they throw each other on the ground; but will laugh, to see at the same time, three or four pair of legs dangling in the air, and nothing but the heads and shoulders of those unfortunate knights, on the ground,-- their antagonists all the while straining every nerve to keep them in that position.

Presently a man steps forward voluntarily, or by solicitation, as a leader. He walks around the fire in the centre of the house, a time or two, and invites the others to join him. Sometimes a keg with a skin stretched over it, is struck a few times, as a signal.

Any person wishing to dance, may now fall in ranks. Generally, an equal number of males & females are engaged at the same time; but strict regularity is not considered necessary.\nThe men and women do not dance alongside, or fronting, each other; but invariably preserve 'Indian file.' The rear is commonly filled up with boys and girls, who are thus initiated into the art at an early age. The leader generally sings extempore: the air is a combination of high and low sounds, used in quick succession, with but few variations, which renders it disagreable and monotonous. He relates his love adventures,-- misfortunes or triumphs;-- boasts of his manhood, influence with the fair sex, and dexterity in various performances.

Any person can commence or leave off dancing, at pleasure. Frequently, a large concourse of people are engaged at the same time. Towards the close of the dance they interlock hands, and represent the figure of a serpent in its coil; and often, the whim of the leader, causes him to make almost as many turnings and windings, and excentric evolutions, as are laid down in a figure of the walls of Troy.

When the hour of dancing arrives, an old man, (generally the oldest in the clan, or town,) commences singing a dirge-like air, and beating time on a skin stretched over the end of a keg. Like all Cherokee airs, it does not possess much variety; some parts, however, are a little touching, and add somewhat to the gloomy feelings produced by surrounding objects, on the mind of one accustomed to civilized society. Before the old man has spent much time in tuning his pipes, two or three women come forward, with terrapin shells on their legs, and keep time by stamping,-- moving around the fire with peculiar facility, and apparent ease: in a short time most of the women present, join in the dance.

It consists in a trembling or rapid vibration of the muscles, and, at the same time, a regular and brisk movement forward, requiring the utmost exertion of muscular power.

They were received by the General Council as friends & brothers; and an appropriation of money was made to procure storage for their horses. After having showed them every friendship, we did not expect that William McIntosh had any ungenerous disposition towards the interest of this nation; but we were mistaken. We find that his visit here must have been entirely through speculative designs. He has used intriguing language with some of our Chiefs, to yield land to the United States’ commissioners, who are now here for that object; and made promises of procuring a large sum of money from the United States’ for them, in which he proposed to participate himself, for his trouble. His verbal suggestion, at first, was not taken notice of; but he still continued in the same course, and made a written communication to Mr. John Ross, the President of the National Committee, on the subject, promising the sum of nineteen thousand dollars paid over to such individuals as he may think proper, in case of a cession. He further stated, verbally, to some of our Chiefs, that he had offered his whole country to the United States’ commissioners for ten dollars per acre, and suggested the idea of the Cherokee creeks Choctaws and Chickesaws, all to surrender up their country, and emigrate west of the Mississippi river, and there to settle themselves under one Government. The letter aforesaid has been exposed & read in open Council to-day, by John Ross, in the presence of William McIntosh; and the General Council now decreed, that William McIntosh be, and is hereby, discharged from ever  * Having any voice in our Councils, hereafter, as a Chief connected with this Nation. \nBrothers,\n\nAn interchange of Chiefs has been established & continued from the time that there was but one agent (Col: Hawkins) for the four nations."},{"pageid":71148,"pagefilename":"295ea52f19818cf221bcd1b67d348c1d.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":71149,"pagefilename":"1d6e2f5bc9b368292cad6784dfc8b519.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":71150,"pagefilename":"63d94d5beb0ebfa583521096944fd1ef.jpg","transcription":"Hightower, October 20th 1824.\nTo your Excellences The Chiefs in Council at New Town.\n\tMy friends And Brothers it is to You I make my difficulties known desiring your aid and assistance naming it is in Your power to give full sanction to this my Request I Will hear try to give you a full Statement being in possession of Some Black people And being Serfs in my affections I debase myself and took one of my Black woman by the name of daull by her I have had three Children named as follows the oldest is Elizabeth about Age Seventeen the next the name of John About the Age of Eleven the next the name Polly about the Age of Seven These is the only children that I have as Sitisans of this Nation and as the time I May he called on to die is unsertain my desire is to have them as free Sitisans of this Nation knowing what property I may have is to be devided Amongst the next of my friends how can I think of them having born of my bone & flesh of my flesh to be called their property & this by my impudent conduck & for them and their offspring to Suffer for Generation yet unborn is a thought of to greate Magnitude for me to remain Silent any longer I therefore Humbly petition your Honours that you may pass a resolution privileging me to thus into execution my desires as so direc by your wisdom a plain In there freedom in whatsoever matter you may think best this your humble petitioner ever pray \n\t\t\t\tCapt Shoe Borts.\n\t\t\tI do certify the above to be a true copy of the original\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA.

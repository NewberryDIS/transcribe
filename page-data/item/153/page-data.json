They are old settlers - boys here twenty years ago. They had a stone threshold of the rock, and found by the constant wear of feet, that it was capable of a high polish. Under the microscope it seems composed entirely of minute shells, one I noticed a trilobite - but microscopic - the shells floating apparently in some flux so transparent that you can see a part of the outline of the shells below the surface. The stone-cutter, who excavated some rock for them showed me the stone - a specimen - under a prospecting glass magnifying 40 or fifty diameters he thought. I was much interested in it, and thought how much undiscovered wealth lies around us, if we had eyes to see it.

It was submitted to a competent geologist at a school of Natural History in Atchison, (85 miles north in this state) and he called it a variety of marble - (my informant said Corlean or Corneal).\nI have over fifty acres in cultivation, 160 fenced. I have two hired boys working. I paid them $16 a month this summer. Last winter for 2 or 3 months I had two young men working for their board - one going to school. I do not think I find farming very profitable as I can not work enough out of doors myself. I do all the housework - never see any girls about the house except the school children - they come here after water. My crop this year is moderate - but better than last year. Probably 12 to 1500 b. of corn 50 of potatoes 2 or 300 of apples. Besides I have been making for sale 6 or 7 lbs of butter a day.

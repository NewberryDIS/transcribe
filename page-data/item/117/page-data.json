Margaret had written me of her coming, and I probably would have met her in Schenectady if I had not had business in Pittsburgh which I could not put off. After some little mis-planning we finally saw each other here last Thursday -Margaret came down that evening and returned Sunday evening. It was rather a thrill to be again waiting for the arrival of one of the Everetts at the station: I knew her readily enough, although I did almost carry off another girl at first, by mistake. As soon as I can arrange it I shall see her in Schenectady, and see if she has made as desirable living arrangements as are possible. I admire her spunk in packing up and coming as she did and am sure she will make good quickly.\nWe discussed various things, aside from our delight in seeing each other (Helen and Margaret seemed to approve of one another and did more discussing, by volume, than I took part in) and among them the educational and other outlook for the family at the moment. At the risk of intruding I am going to \"make a few remarks\" which may or may not be appropos but which are surely meant well.\nI deduced from Margaret's comments and remarks that she is relied upon, or has offered, to help Mary financially this spring. I do not believe she should, but that she definitely should be enjoined from it. She is in a slightly different environment now, and must if she is to profit by it, get ahead financially if only by a tiny margin. I firmly believe she will require all that she can earn for the next twelve months to equip her properly with clothes, \"appurtenances\" and the outer panoply of inner confidence which she will inevitably require to profit by the opportunities which can be expected to appear in Schenectady or elsewhere in the east. Her health being what it is, she requires some little smoothnesses in the way of life which she only can get by having the full use of her earnings. For emergencies' and mental-ease's sake she should gradually acquire a reserve fund of at least a few dollars also.\nAs I understand the situation, Edward will be able to assume his own destiny's control (if fortune is normally good) after this school year is passed and a summer's rest. Although Margerat said nothing on this point I have somehow received the impression that for you to carry Mary through the balance of her college course will mean a lessening of the insurance and other reserves which you and mother possess or may come to have.\nI am not able to take over Mary's college expenses as I should like to. If unmarried I could do it in full, and would have volunteered to some time since. I hope to help Margaret some now: not in a direct financial way, but in helping her to opportunities for self-advancement (materially speaking) and to certain occasional relaxations, which represent financial outlay indirectly. I want to help Edward to chances to get on his feet in a material way, also, if I can. But I feel very strongly that the essential for the family is now for Margaret first, then Edward, to get on their feet financially. We have been \"poor\" too long - in the sense that we have worked without the proper tools, the proper material footing to do ourselves justice. If Margaret can be left alone for a year I believe she will establish a new sort of independence that will be worth far more than a certain number of dollars to her: Edward can do the same in a short time after graduation if he can find himself in reasonably favorable surroundings."},{"pageid":28572,"pagefilename":"931c757934949de5fabad01ea33c3467.jpg","transcription":"All this, it would seem, cold-bloodedly disregards the youngest of the brood, Mary. Knowing that I may be open to misinterpretation, I still must say that I believe that Mary should stop college until conditions are easier. I do not believe that you and mother should deplete your resources at this time; I do not believe Margaret can help Mary or the family as a whole as much by sending money to Minnesota now as she can by spending her money for her own protection and advancement and independence; and I think Edward's best service to himself and his parents and brother and sisters is to get himself fixed firmly on his own feet as promptly as may be.\nIf, a year from now, I can send Mary $25 a month, which I am confident I can do then during her college terms, and Margaret is on her feet and can spare a few dollars a months, and Howard and Zaidee can be counted on for certain additions, won't Mary find herself able to return to college more contentedly, more independently, with more satisfaction and less of the \"poor\" feeling, than she has today? In the meantime, can't she, without demeaning or belittling or hardening herself, support herself by teaching or in some other way, and be able to return to college, when she does, with new clothes etc., etc?\nI am writing somewhat crudely I guess - partly because I am forced to write a little in haste - but I hope that I won't be misunderstood.\nCan you let me know what Mary's expenses for the balance of this school year will be?

Perhaps I ought not to speak of the reason for delay in this manner when the real reason has been my own state of mind. It has been very hard to bring myself to do the things that were for me to do even though they were very important. Hattie entered life immortal one week ago last Sunday afternoon at five o'clock and the consequent sorrow in my own heart has stood in the way of all my normal life. I have neglected my best friends. I know I ought to have better control of myself, but it is taking time for me to get the mastery.\nWe brought her home the first week in June reaching home the 3rd. It was quite an undertaking to make the journey, but we were prospered on the trip and the precious wife was greatly cheered to be in her own home again and surrounded by her old friends. For a few days the change seemed to help her, but it was only temporary. Reaction set in and it soon became evident that she could last only a very short time. Elizabeth and her family came home and their coming also helped for a few days, but nothing in this world could hold that sweet spirit in the body. She realized that she could remain only a short time and after the situation appeared to her in the true light she wanted to go as soon as possible. She was unconscious the most of the time for several days. The final passing was quiet and without a struggle.\nI think that outside of the immediately family you knew her better than any of our other relatives. I shall never forget your association with us in our temporary home in New York. You know how brave and sweet and true her spirit was though her body was so frail. She accomplished a wonderful amount of work with very little physical strength. I do not know how I can get along without her. After a man lives in this world as long as I have he ought to be able to stand alone, but some way I feel my dependence upon that dear woman more and more as I try to face the duties and problems of life. I am thankful to have the dear daughter and her children who are with me at least for the summer. They are a great help.

I do not remember anything that happened between February and May, tho I suppose I must have been at the same old routine of studying the language and teaching English. In May I finished my second year of Chinese except for the history, which was in English, and which I had been dreading ever since I arrived in China. You know I do not like history. So I made up my mind that should be my summer's work. May was quite memorable because for the first time in my life I was a bridesmaid. The wedding was that of two our American Board missionaries in Pekin, Mr. Cross and Miss Tenney, and we had a great time, with several people up from echow and even one out from Shanai. Before and after the wedding, of course, there were a number of other good time when the group of young people who have been together a great deal tried to see as much of each other as possible before a number of them went home to America.\nWith June came the closing of schools. The boarding school closed about thirteen days early because of scarlet fever and measles, both of which broke out on the same day. We isolated the cases and hoped to continue, but the rest of the girls kept imagining themselves sick and kept the doctor on his way here most of the time until we had no peace and decided that we might as well give up for good. When school was out and the girls had gone home it was about time to go to Wo Fo Ssu to the Y.W.C.A. summer conference and I enjoyed it very much. There was a much larger number of foreigners present than the year before and more Chines girls, in spite of the fact that people had that on account of the student uprising there would be a small attendance. I was recreation chairman. This is my second Y.W.C.A. summer conference. There was not a great deal made of patriotism as a them, but we all felt that the girls had been affected by the student movement. They are more independent and ready to push ahead. I noticed it particularly in the matter of recreation. The year before we had to keep making them do things, and this year they wanted to do things themselves and even went ahead of our plans for them. Miss T'ao, who is studying in the Y.W.C.A. physical training school in Shanghai, had charge of calisthenics and I had charge of taking them on trips, arranging Stunt Day and such things. We had some very good times. On Stunt Day the foreign leaders acted out a Chinese primary school with Mrs. Jewell of the Methodist Mission as teacher, and what roars of laughter when we foreigners appeared in Chinese clothes with out hair in pigtails!\nAfter the conference I went straight to Peitaiho, where I spent six weeks, being housekeeper for the family. Through July there was a small family, only about six most of the time, at Gould Cottage, but the servants were hard to manage, so it was not an easy job. Every day I buckled down to Chinese history and at the end of July had the satisfaction of finishing it, with about ten days or two weeks left of vacation. Then I had sick headaches all that time and didn't have any fun. I had planned to have a number of trips, but did not get outside of Peitaiho. Mable was there for three of the weeks I was, so we managed to get a good visit. The beginning of August there was  a three days meeting of the Chihli-Shanzi Christian Educational Association, which happened to strike town just as the hottest wave that Peitaiho has known for several years arrived. as the educators, great and"},{"pageid":28670,"pagefilename":"6c2c51ecacac39a3cafcdfbc1e005380.jpg","transcription":"-2-\nwould-be-great, sweltered as they discussed what they were going to do with Chinese education. As soon as that was over I came back to Tungshien. We had here a teachers' conference (institute) for twenty days, with about 150 Chinese teachers in attendance. This is the second year it has been held here, and everyone seems to think that this year was an improvement over previous years in a number of respects. The teachers who taught in the Institute were for the most part English, and it was my job to keep house for them. You know about how much I know about English people, anyway. I cannot remember having had a speaking acquaintance with one until I came out here, and it was some job to try and make them happy in that awful August weather. But they were all very delightful people and I continue to be glad I had the opportunity to get acquainted at such close range. I went to some of the meetings, but most of what I learned I learned outside in hearing the tachers talk, My time was very full getting ready for school to start, which it was to do as soon as the Institute was over, and altho I had been here a year in connection with this school I still knew very little about educational problems and I knew few Chinese equivalents for educational terms.\nThe first of September we opened the girls' boarding school. Of the four teachers three are new, one of them a teacher who has taught in one of our primary schools for some 20 years and has just been promoted to the position in the boarding school. The two other teachers are newly graduated, one from academy and one form the college normal department. I had rather supposed that we would not have any larger enrollment than last year because we have done no advertising, and I was not particularly anxious to have a large increase at the time of a change in management; but instead of 66 we have 77 with prospects of some others coming the second term.\nOne interesting things about the school this year is that we have a graduating class of 17; six is the largest they have ever had before. I think in many ways this simplifies the management of the school this year, because I know these older girls best, having had them in English classes, and when I get them with me in a matter the younger girls do not dare have a different opinion. I was somewhat disappointed last year, but not particularly surprised, to find that this school stood lowest of the 18 grade school which took the uniform examinations given by the Association, but we are hoping to do much better this year. So I have a great deal of encouragement, the many times it seems a hopeless task making them remember to do the things which they are supposed to do and not to do the things they are supposed not to do.\nLast year we had six primary schools. This year before the year is over we will have nine. They were supposed to begin the first of September and five began then, but for various very good reasons the others have opened one by one. The new school at the Drum Tower Church, which had been the center of our fond hopes, could not begin because the building has not been finished. Also, the house for the teacher had no sooner been finished than an extra heavy rain melted the building into mud. It had been made of cheap mud bricks and not sufficiently protected until it was dry. It was a great disappointment, but now it is rebuilt and a school house and kindergarten are finished, the yard all smoothed, and we are having school. The school is not as big as it ought to be, and it is great fun to hear the teacher tell what all those children can think of to do and what funny writing they make; but the poor lit-"},{"pageid":28671,"pagefilename":"b877ec944bd7480f3f33f29d33a1a47d.jpg","transcription":"-3-\n-tle things never had a chance to go to school before and they haven't had much teaching at home, so we mustn't expect too much of them.\nTung Pan? opened about two weeks late and is my prize school because, for all it is new and in a very small town, they now have 32 pupils, all girls, and a very enthusiastic teacher who is making a great hit. The teacher was in last week and was telling me about what a time she had teaching the children. She said that when she bad them make Arabic numerals, they objected because they were \"foreign\", and they did not believe her when she told them their science lessons. They are almost entirely outside the church, most of them from families who have had almost no touch with the Church, so they do not see why they should not have school every day of the week. She does not dare not let them come on Sunday and so when they come she has Sunday-school and at church time she says, \"Now I am going to church. You may just sit here and study your Bible lesson and be very, very quiet. That is, unless you want to go with me. Anybody who wants to may go with me to church.\" And so far everyone has elected church.\nOf the other two schools which I hope to have, one would have begun the first of September except that cholera has been especially bad in that place and they have not opened yet. I hope they can begin within a week or so. The other is a place where we had not planned to have s school, but since school began they have become enthusiastic over having a school and I told them that we would help hem with $80 if they did the rest.- just as we had in the case of other places where we have opened new schools. I didn't really expect them to do anything, and I am not sure that money is going to be very plentiful, but when they got so enthusiastic and did their part I had to keep my promise, and a week or so will find a new school started there. I hope that it won't be more than two or three years until all these country places where we have churches will have schools as well, and it certainly looks as tho it wouldn't be any more than that before we could accomplish it.\nAll the American missionaries have been busy these days working on the Interchurch survey. My part in it was not very large compared to that of the people who planned a work over larger territory, but it means that I should plan definitely what I hoped to do in the boarding school for the next 5 years, and not only in the boarding school but in the matter of primary schools; they really are not separate, because if we have more lower primary schools it means more pupils for the higher primary, but if we have more schools in the country that means that more girls can study at home, and less come to boarding school. I am glad that these plans had to be made now because I might not have been so prompt if I hadn't been having the pressure of some outside force, and certainly the boarding school, at least, has come to the place where it is ready for expansion. The way it has grown this year without any effort to get more pupils is a little indication of what is likely to happen when we try to get more. It means that within a year's time we must have some more buildings or limit the number of pupils to less than would naturally come. I have pretty clearly in mind what I hope to do.\nNext year we need a building for the third and fourth grades which will leave our present recitation rooms free for the use of the higher primary, that is the 5th, 6th and 7th grades. Then we must have some more dormitories and I hope not only for dormitories to use several rooms for laundry and bathing purposes which are at present squeezed into very small space.

Maybe some of the other secretaries would like to come, too, since it is such a fine day.\nWe will go down by the moat on the way into the city. This old gentleman we are meeting is my teacher. He has the proverbial classical teacher's air and walk; I suppose it must look strange to him to see us swinging along so fast. His greeting of, \"Where are you going?\" is partly curiosity, I shall have to confess, altho it is a polite greeting. And please do not think I am rude when I say, \"Into the city,\" altho he can plainly see that that is where we are bound. Chinese etiquette does not require that we tell him the exact place.\nWe go past the church and over to just inside the South Gate, and there we will find some rickshaws. In good Chinese fashion, we dicker for the price and jew him down one penny, because we do not want to change the custom, and they all know that we always pay ten coppers to Mrs. Wang's. As we go along, on both sides of the road are the places where the soldiers drill, and they are all drilling, too. There is a bunch doing the goose step, just as Germans would do.\nNow, this place where they have the fair is one the rickshaw men always seem to like to go thru, even tho it is a much slower way, because we have to stop for the crowds so. I always want to buy something, but there isn't anything that we could use very well. I wonder what that funny music is about. - I never heard anything so wierd or elaborate. I suppose when we reach the crowd we will find out. Oh, the rickshaw man says it is a funeral. It certainly is elegant, and I wish we could see the costumes a little better. There seem to be a large number of priests.\nNow we are past the main street and can move faster, altho these hutungs are very much in need of repair. This reminds me of one time in Peking when we were walking along and remarked, \"What nice wide hutungs!\" and then suddenly laughed to think how we would have looked at them a year ago when we were fresh from America and its wide streets. The last time I came over to Mrs. Wang's was in one of the biggest snow storms we had last winter, when she invited Miss Smith and me over to east cho-po-pos. Then there was a goat tied in the corner of the room next hers, and the rest of the room and another were filled with fodder and fuel.\nBut, here we are, and Mrs. Wang is greeting us. A number of people are already here. I do not remember their names, but they are all women that I have met before. This is Ch'ien Lao Tai Tai that you may have heard about. She is certainly an enthusiastic church member. I suppose she has brought that brilliant great-grandson of hers over to the kindergarten. Sure enough, there he is, sitting in one of the little chairs, waiting for the show to begin. Mrs. Wang says he has been there day after day since the rooms have been fixed up, always sitting in the little chairs. I wonder what thoughts are running through his little head as he looks forward to this wonderful kindergarten.\nWe will put up these bright-colored pictures that I have brought. This room with its clean, white walls and its little tables and chairs is truly a transformation from those two small room full of fodder. We might look around a bit while we are waiting for more people to come. That structure they are putting up in the yard is a mat awning. They say that the other family in this court is to marry the son soon. Look at that funny chicken tied to an old shoe by a string; that is a good way to safeguard it from running away."},{"pageid":28674,"pagefilename":"4b9b2d12df0ec64e335e42d340ea33fb.jpg","transcription":"--2\nAnd just see that spoiled little youngster, all dressed in red, eating out of that tiny little wooden dish about as big as a pickle, and his big sister tagging around after him, letting him do whatever he wants to, in true Chinese fashion.\nOh, here comes the teacher, and she has brought with her her little four year old niece. My, what a bright, pretty child! all the women remark about her and ask who she is; and when they find that she is the niece of the \"lao shih\" they say, \"How beautiful! How bright! Not to be wondered at.\" Here come three or four more women, bringing two children, a brother and sister. Doesn't that one just want to make you call here, \"The Old Dowager\", with her can and her airs? Isn't it nice, the way all the other women give her the precedence?\nWhat's the excitement? Oh, it must be that the hsien official's grandson has arrived. Here he comes, borne aloft by a big man servant. And there is his amah behind, carrying a thermos bottle. He is not such a wonderful looking little lad to have all this fuss, in spite of his good clothes and his cap with its big red ball on top. You know they say that one reason why they send him to kindergarten is in order to get him weaned. He is certainly old enough - four years old.\nNow the teacher is going to write down their names. Some of them have names, but some still have their baby names and want the teacher to give them student names. This little girl's mother says she must ask her mother-in-law and tell the teacher to-morrow, if the name is all right. She cannot even name her own daughter.\nNow at last the kindergarten is really opened and the children are playing with the peg-board. but their mothers and grandmothers cannot let them along; it is quite a race to see which one can help her small relative get through first. I am afraid they are disappointed because they cannot see anything remarkable in the amount of progress that their youngsters have made today, but at least they have something to come back for to-morrow. It is strange that there are only eight children here to-day besides the teacher's little niece. They said they were going to have twenty. But it seems that to-morrow is a lucky day, and I suppose some of them are waiting until then to start. Anyway, I will trust Mrs. Wang to hunt up the children and Miss Chu to keep them after they come. She has eighteen in her other kindergarten now, and there is no reason why this one should not be just as big, if not bigger.\nMiss Chu is giving the signal for the kindergartners to make their bow to her, and I suppose it is time to go. I do hope you are not sorry to have spent so much time.\nAlice Margaret Huggins"},{"pageid":28675,"pagefilename":"3d55c3a2ad5b0f9f6f51f7b30c97a540.jpg","transcription":"stamp--U.S.POSTAGE 2 CENTS\nMr. J.

Scott was very willing to transfer to them. Mr. Ross was chosen the Superintendent of this removal, and with accustomed confidence the Nation looked to him as their Principal Chief. From that time he took his residence at the Agency only visiting his own home once in two or three weeks; and these generally obliged to accomplish the ride after he had finished the business of the day, and return as early as possible the next morning. In these visits, he would sometimes give us a hasty call, and when apprised of his being at home. The Doctor and myself have said, \"Now, Mr. Ross you need Mr. Payne to assist you in writing.\" He replied, \"Yes, I have thought of it, but so much jealousy exists in the minds of some, it might not prove a judicious plan in the end.\" Here I presume he attended to a class of people who were endeavoring to break up the arrangement between Gen Scott and himself. In this class was a set of Speculators desiring offices in the union Some had been employed, by Government, and others stood by, asking appointments. But when the change was made, the Cherokees were appointed to every office, they were capable of filling. These Speculators with a determination  not to relinquish their expectations of gain, began to throw obstacles in the way, and return the removal which they had before, been so anxious to hasten. As I have been informed, they thought one effectual, means of doing things would be, to create disputes faction among the lower class of Cherokees. with the movements of Mr. Ross telling things only a few of the men enlightened of their people would reap any benefit from the change. Their object, they wilfully circulated an approval as originating with Mr. Ross for many Cherokees to return to their homes, particularly those who had dwelt in the mountains to be removed at some future time, telling them they would the, receive better money for their valuations, with various other benefits. During these trying seasons, I have often wondered why Mr. Ross did not place them before the public,and have to. But I presume he had no time for this, and perhaps deemed it an unsuitable season, to stir up the wrath of his antagonists. I foresee if letters have not been intercepted, the things I have stated, have stated, have been reasons why he has not corresponded with you, as was expected, I can not believe his silence is the result of any change of feeling towards you, however mysterious it may seem. I have been trying to recall to mind the circumstances of my East call on him and his family but such was the state of things, it almost seems like a dream.

I will ask him to consult with Mr. Ross and ascertain whether he has taken any measures to assist you since his return from Washington.

And the number that is now dying, and  the distress of the living, while on the journey, with what they will doubtly be obliged to suffer, when they arrive in their new country, ought to stir up our Government to their effectual relief. I have heard of the number of deaths from only four companies since they left. Two of these, each containing about eleven hundred persons, had buried between fifty and sixty persons in each. Another with about one thousand persons had lost fifty two, and thirty eight from another, which, numbers seven hundred and fifty. These deaths had occurred when they had arrived, not quite half way. Unless the distress of this people are brought before the rulers of our Nation, how can they feel on this important subject and who\n\nwill bring up these distresses, but the friends of the Indians? -- and how can the friends of Indians do it, unless they can obtain a knowledge of the need.

Upon which, their associates  assembled in arms & threat cries to kill Mr. John Ross and a number of others; although they well knew that these persons had no agency in the death of their friends. These threats roused the public feelings to a high pitch. The young men, with arms, rushed in from all quarters to see and hear and share the danger; & if necessary, to guard the lives of their friends.\n    When the news of Boudinotes death reached Mr. Ross, he was altogether unprotected, and ignorant of danger.

Sweetwater, at the longitude of McClellan Creek I have not been but think that water could not be found so far West.

Shin oak abound to a considerable extent, the valley is not extensive, but little hay could be obtained, it is not much subject to overflow, the nearest timber is found on Gageby Creek or the Washita.

Adjt. Gen'l Dept. of Texas\nSir:\n\n        I have the honor to make the following statement in reply to the questions asked by the Asst. Adjt. General, Dept. of Texas.\n\n1st.   I visited McClellan Creek twice in the year 1871. Water was found standing in large pools, but quite deep and sweet, the water near the mouth of this stream runs in the sand. In 1874 the stream was very much swollen on account of heavy rains. I think water can be found in the stream all the year round, but I don't think it will be running unless an unusually wet season. The water near the mouth of McClellan Creek is salty and brackish and in the year 1871 we were compelled to dig for water  for both men and animals of the Command a few miles below the mouth of McClellan Creek in the North Fork. The Sweetwater has good water about four miles from the mouth. I cannot say as to the permanency of the water in this stream as I was never on this stream about the longitude of the mouth of McClellan Creek except in a wet season but I am of the opinion that water can be had about 15 miles below the longitude referred to at all times. The North Fork never has running water except in wet seasons and as a general thing it is salty and brackish."},{"pageid":69240,"pagefilename":"7b600f24be295e0f8f6b360f7920effc.jpg","transcription":"2nd.   The timber on the above mentioned streams is Cottonwood, some little Elm and Hackberry on McClellan Creek , the most timber is to be found on McClellan Creek and the North Fork above McClellan Creek.\n3rd.    McClellan Creek cannot be depended on for grass, as for instance in 1871 we found several large bottoms of grass , in 1874 none was to be found whatever except on the hillsides or divides. The North Fork has grasses only in patches of a few acres and generally of a very poor quality. The Sweetwater has some very fine bottoms and more abundance of grass than either of the other two streams.\n4th.    I do not think that building stone can be had in the vicinity of either stream, although there is appearances of stone but in my opinion it is too soft to be quarried I think that soil can be had on either McClellan Creek or Sweetwater for making adobes. \n5th.    As a general thing the country is very much broken, the soil sandy and covered with shin oak, some parts of it good divides can be found with very short grass. In my opinion the country along the Sweetwater is considered as the best with the exception of timber.\n6th.    Not being versed in the science of Geology I cannot answer this question. \n7th.    I think fuel may be obtained in the vicinity of either for several years but it may necessitate it being hauled several miles. I do not think that  timber for building purposes can be had in the vicinity of either.\n8th.    Hay may be obtained on the Sweetwater but on the other two streams it cannot be had.\n9th.    Yes there is large bottoms on all these streams the largest are on the Sweetwater but few of them have timber they have standing water in them in wet seasons I do not think that they overflow, but in my opinion they are unhealthy and productive of  chills and fever.\nVery Respectfully\nYour obdt. servant\nRobert G.

ten years.\nDept. of Justice,\nWashington, June 1873.\nTo the President,\n\n       Sir,\n               I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt from you of several papers relative to the Modoc Indians now in the custody of the U.S. Army with a request for my opinion as to the authority to try certain of the prisoners by a Military Tribunal. The main facts out of which the question arises are these:\n\n  In 1864 the United States made a treaty with these Indians by the terms of which they were to go and remain upon a reservation in the State of Oregon. Late last fall, the Indians being away from their reservation, a military detachment was sent to procure their return. Finding them unwilling to go peacefully, the Officer indicated his determination to use compulsion in consequence of which a conflict ensued between the U.S. troops and the Indians.\n Soon after several peacable citizens and their families in the vicinity were murdered by Indians of this band. They then entrenched themselves in the lava beds in the neighborhood, fighting ensued and one or more severe battles in which persons on both sides were wounded or killed , and the U.S. troops repulsed.\n  Pending hostilities, negotiations were opened for peace and on the 15th of April last General Canby, Rev. Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Meacham at a point between the opposing forces, and in pursuance of a mutual agreement to that end, met Captain Jack the leader of the Indians, with some of the Chief Warriors, to discuss the term of a treaty, and while so engaged, General Canby and Mr. Thomas were treacherously assassinated and Mr. Meacham severely wounded by the Indians present upon that occasion. Battles followed and Captain Jack and all or most of his tribe have been captured and are now in the hands of the military authorities.\n  General Sherman, in a communication to the Secretary of War dated the 3rd, instant recommends that such of the Indians as have violated military law, be tried by a military tribunal.\n  This recommendation is approved by the Secretary of War. Instructions were prepared in 1868 by Frances Lieber, L.L.D., revised by a Board of Officers, of which General E. A. Hitchcock was president, and after approval by the President of the United States,"},{"pageid":69244,"pagefilename":"78b93153a3c50f31b17b069503e125e1.jpg","transcription":"were published for the Government of the Armies of the U.S. in the field. Section 13 of the \"instructions\" is as follows:\n\n    \"Military jurisdiction is of two kinds - \n\nfirst, that which is conferred and defined by the statute,\nsecond, that which is derived from the common law of war.\n\n     Military offences under the statute law must be tried in the manner therein directed but military offences which do not come within the statute must be tried and punished under the common law of war.\"\n     The character of the Courts which exercise these jurisdictions depends upon the local laws of each particular country. In the Armies of the United States the first is exercised by Court Martial while cases which do not come within the rules and articles of war or the jurisdiction conferred by statute on Courts Martial are tried by Military Commissions.\n     All the authorities which I have been able to examine upon this subject, harmonize with these instructions. According to the laws of war, there is nothing more sacred than a flag of truce dispatched in good faith, and there can be no greater act of perfidy and treachery than the assassination of its bearers, after they have been acknowledged and received by those, to whom they are sent. No statute of the United States makes this act a crime, and therefore it is not punishable under the \"rules and articles of war\" and if punishable at all, must be through a power derived from the usages of war. Kindred to the act in question in bad faith, is the breaking of his parole by a paroled prisoner.\n     While the United States were at war with Mexico, several officers of the Mexican Army were tried by a Military Commission composed of officers of the United States army and convicted and sentenced to be shot and executed for breaking their paroles. Numerous trials of a similar nature took place during the war of the Rebellion but there are no statutory provisions whatever upon the subject and the whole power of the military authorities in such cases is derived from the usages of\n\nwar. \n\n     On the 23rd of August 1865 a Military Commission duly appointed, assembled in the city of Washington for the trial of Henry Wirtz, who pleaded among other things that the Military Commission had no jurisdiction over either his person or over the subject matter of the charges and specifications, being a tribunal unauthorized by either statute, military law, or well established usage.\n     But this plea was overruled and he was convicted upon several charges, one of which was murder in violation of the laws and customs of war and after sentence he was hung for his crimes.\n     All the proceedings in this case derived their authority and validity from the common law of war."},{"pageid":69245,"pagefilename":"17f0e80794218ee629fed4c48323e65b.jpg","transcription":"Certain persons it will be remembered were tried and convicted in the same way for the assassination of President Lincoln.\n\n  Attorney General Steed in discussing this object (opinion Vol. II page 297) says that we have seen that when war comes, the laws and usages of war come also, and that during the war they are part of the laws of the land under the Constitution. Congress may define and punish offences against the laws, but in default of Congress defining those laws and prescribing a punishment for their infraction, and the mode of proceeding to ascertain whether an offence has been committed, and what punishment is to be inflicted - the Army must be governed by the laws and usages of war as understood and practiced by the civilized Nations of the world.\"\n   Again - \"If the prisoner be a regular unoffending soldier of the opposite party to the war, he should be treated with all the courtesy and kindness consistent with his safe custody. If he has offended against the laws of war, he should have trial and punishment as the laws of war require.\n   A spy, though a prisoner of war, may be tried, condemned and executed by a military tribunal without a breach of the constitution.\n   A Bushwacker, a Jayhawker, a bandit, a war rebel, an assassin - being public enemies - may be tried, condemned and executed as offenders against the laws of war.\" \n   The laws of Nations, which is the result of the experience and wisdom of ages has decided that Jayhawkers, bandits etc. are offenders against the laws of Nature & War, and as such amenable to the military.\n   Our Constitution has made these laws a part of the laws of the land ( see also Vattel 359, Wheaton's International Law 416, Woolsey's Int.

All the laws and customs of civilized warfare may not be applicable to an armed conflict with Indian tribes upon our Western frontier, but the circumstances attending the assassination of General [strike] Canby and Thomas, are such as to make their murder as much a violation of the laws of savage as of civilized warfare, and the Indians concerned in it fully understood the baseness and treachery of their act.\n         It is difficult to define exactly the relations of the Indian tribes to the United States, but as they have been recognized as independent communities for treaty making purposes, and as they frequently carry on organized and protracted wars, they may properly, as it seems to me, be held subject to those rules of warfare which make a negociation for peace after hostilities possible, and which make perfidy like that in question, punishable by military authority.\n         Doubtless the war with the Modocs is practically ended, unless some of them should escape and renew hostilities; but it is the right of the United States, as there is no agreement for peace, to determine for themselves, whether or not anything ought to be done for the protection of the country, or the punishment of crimes, growing out of the war.\n         Section 59. of said Instructions is as follows: -\n\n\"A prisoner of war remains answerable for his crimes committed against the captor's army or people, committed before he was captured and for which he has not been punished by his own authorities.\"\n\n         The conclusion therefore is, that a Military Commission may be appointed to try such of the Modoc Indians now in custody as are charged with offences against the recognized laws of war, and that if, upon such trial, any are found guilty, they may be subjected to such punishment as those laws require or justify.\n                                                                            (Sgd) George H.

Sanderson, 11\" Infy. who is more familiar with facts and transactions, connected with the Indians on this reservation for the past two years, than any other man.  It has never been urged by anyone, I believe, that Satanta had any claim to mitigation of the punishment awarded him, or was justly entitled to mercy of any kins, and his temporary release from the Penitentiary, was granted not from consideration to him [3 word underline], but as a kind of bribe to his tribe to cease depredating in Texas, and upon the pledge of the tribe that it would do so.\nHowever that [strike 2 words] In case it did not however Satanta was to be returned to the Penitentiary or \"others equal to him\".  The latter clause of this condition is of course worthless, as even Indians - unfortunately sometimes -  cannot be picked up and sent to the Penitentiary without a trial, and Indians convicted of raiding into Texas would hardly escape with the Penitentiary.   The question as to whether Satanta himself became hostile again or not, was not considered, and did not enter at all into the condition of his release.  There is no question as to Kiowas having raided in Texas since his release - and there is no question as to the course of Satanta, if the Indians had had a show of success.  Had he been so disposed, he could have come in with White House and other Kiowas, who"},{"pageid":69253,"pagefilename":"3cc930cfc36c654a6da3b375a350ddeb.jpg","transcription":"167\nasked to come in before the tribes had effected anything.  But he waits until every attempt of the Indians had failed, before he left them to come in to surrender.  It is not understood that Satanta himself complains that he is unjustly dealt with, neither does his tribe make such complaint.  This attempt to keep him out of the penitentiary is believed to originate with the same parties and in the same spirit that prompted the efforts made to the Governor of Texas to commute his original sentence of death to confinement in the Penitentiary for life and to which he modestly [strike] unfortunately yielded.\n\n                                                            (Sgd) C.

He can get his command together and make a start from Sill in plenty of time to leave Beaver Creek on the 18th.\n            It is simply that he might be needed and that his command has the time to spare.

If these troubles continue however, it will be advisable to Establish such a Camp and beyond even the Otter. My recollection of the terms of the Contract with the transportation - contractor is, that he can be required to take supplies beyond the Posts a hundred and fifty miles. If this ve so, the supplies for such a Camp can be loaded at unknown and taken directly to it, and there will be no necessity for purchasing additional mules. In this event I would bring up some Infantry from Fort Brown, I wish you would have Supplies for MacRenze's command sent to Camp supply, he may unknown over there- say thirty days for five hundred men and animals. The Born Contractor here informs me, that there need be no anxiety about born here after the 12th inst. when his trains begin to arrive. Buell camped fifteen miles from here last night and I hope with be in before the maid leaves = 12 o'clock today = I can then inform you what orders he has from McRenze's.

I do not believe he can carry over fifteen days supplies though will last twenty if necessary twenty days, and will enable him to reach MacRenze's Supply Camp, where MacRenze's can, if he desires, add to his transportation.

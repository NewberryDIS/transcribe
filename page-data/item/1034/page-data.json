Sweetwater, at the longitude of McClellan Creek I have not been, but think that water could not be found so far West.

It is a swift running stream and I am informed that the Indians say it never dries, but an abundance of water is found there at all times. There is but little timber found for building purposes.

Shin oak abound to a considerable extent, the valley is not extensive, but little hay could be obtained, it is not much subject to overflow, the nearest timber is found on Gageby Creek or the Washita.

Adjt. Gen'l Dept. of Texas\nSir:\n\n        I have the honor to make the following statement in reply to the questions asked by the Asst. Adjt. General, Dept. of Texas.\n\n1st.   I visited McClellan Creek twice in the year 1871. Water was found standing in large pools, but quite deep and sweet, the water near the mouth of this stream runs in the sand. In 1874 the stream was very much swollen on account of heavy rains. I think water can be found in the stream all the year round, but I don't think it will be running unless an unusually wet season. The water near the mouth of McClellan Creek is salty and brackish and in the year 1871 we were compelled to dig for water  for both men and animals of the Command a few miles below the mouth of McClellan Creek in the North Fork. The Sweetwater has good water about four miles from the mouth. I cannot say as to the permanency of the water in this stream as I was never on this stream about the longitude of the mouth of McClellan Creek except in a wet season but I am of the opinion that water can be had about 15 miles below the longitude referred to at all times. The North Fork never has running water except in wet seasons and as a general thing it is salty and brackish."},{"pageid":69240,"pagefilename":"7b600f24be295e0f8f6b360f7920effc.jpg","transcription":"2nd.   The timber on the above mentioned streams is Cottonwood, some little Elm and Hackberry on McClellan Creek , the most timber is to be found on McClellan Creek and the North Fork above McClellan Creek.\n3rd.    McClellan Creek cannot be depended on for grass, as for instance in 1871 we found several large bottoms of grass , in 1874 none was to be found whatever except on the hillsides or divides. The North Fork has grasses only in patches of a few acres and generally of a very poor quality. The Sweetwater has some very fine bottoms and more abundance of grass than either of the other two streams.\n4th.    I do not think that building stone can be had in the vicinity of either stream, although there is appearances of stone but in my opinion it is too soft to be quarried I think that soil can be had on either McClellan Creek or Sweetwater for making adobes. \n5th.    As a general thing the country is very much broken, the soil sandy and covered with shin oak, some parts of it good divides can be found with very short grass. In my opinion the country along the Sweetwater is considered as the best with the exception of timber.\n6th.    Not being versed in the science of Geology I cannot answer this question. \n7th.    I think fuel may be obtained in the vicinity of either for several years but it may necessitate it being hauled several miles. I do not think that  timber for building purposes can be had in the vicinity of either.\n8th.    Hay may be obtained on the Sweetwater but on the other two streams it cannot be had.\n9th.    Yes there is large bottoms on all these streams the largest are on the Sweetwater but few of them have timber they have standing water in them in wet seasons I do not think that they overflow, but in my opinion they are unhealthy and productive of  chills and fever.\nVery Respectfully\nYour obdt. servant\nRobert G.

ten years.\nDept. of Justice,\nWashington, June 1873.\nTo the President,\n\n       Sir,\n               I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt from you of several papers relative to the Modoc Indians now in the custody of the U.S. Army with a request for my opinion as to the authority to try certain of the prisoners by a Military Tribunal. The main facts out of which the question arises are these:\n\n  In 1864 the United States made a treaty with these Indians by the terms of which they were to go and remain upon a reservation in the State of Oregon. Late last fall, the Indians being away from their reservation, a military detachment was sent to procure their return. Finding them unwilling to go peacefully, the Officer indicated his determination to use compulsion in consequence of which a conflict ensued between the U.S. troops and the Indians.\n Soon after several peacable citizens and their families in the vicinity were murdered by Indians of this band. They then entrenched themselves in the lava beds in the neighborhood, fighting ensued and one or more severe battles in which persons on both sides were wounded or killed , and the U.S. troops repulsed.\n  Pending hostilities, negotiations were opened for peace and on the 15th of April last General Canby, Rev. Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Meacham at a point between the opposing forces, and in pursuance of a mutual agreement to that end, met Captain Jack the leader of the Indians, with some of the Chief Warriors, to discuss the term of a treaty, and while so engaged, General Canby and Mr. Thomas were treacherously assassinated and Mr. Meacham severely wounded by the Indians present upon that occasion. Battles followed and Captain Jack and all or most of his tribe have been captured and are now in the hands of the military authorities.\n  General Sherman, in a communication to the Secretary of War dated the 3rd, instant recommends that such of the Indians as have violated military law, be tried by a military tribunal.\n  This recommendation is approved by the Secretary of War. Instructions were prepared in 1868 by Frances Lieber, L.L.D., revised by a Board of Officers, of which General E. A. Hitchcock was president, and after approval by the President of the United States,"},{"pageid":69244,"pagefilename":"78b93153a3c50f31b17b069503e125e1.jpg","transcription":"were published for the Government of the Armies of the U.S. in the field. Section 13 of the \"instructions\" is as follows:\n\n    \"Military jurisdiction is of two kinds - \n\nfirst, that which is conferred and defined by the statute,\nsecond, that which is derived from the common law of war.\n\n     Military offences under the statute law must be tried in the manner therein directed but military offences which do not come within the statute must be tried and punished under the common law of war.\"\n     The character of the Courts which exercise these jurisdictions depends upon the local laws of each particular country. In the Armies of the United States the first is exercised by Court Martial while cases which do not come within the rules and articles of war or the jurisdiction conferred by statute on Courts Martial are tried by Military Commissions.\n     All the authorities which I have been able to examine upon this subject, harmonize with these instructions. According to the laws of war, there is nothing more sacred than a flag of truce dispatched in good faith, and there can be no greater act of perfidy and treachery than the assassination of its bearers, after they have been acknowledged and received by those, to whom they are sent. No statute of the United States makes this act a crime, and therefore it is not punishable under the \"rules and articles of war\" and if punishable at all, must be through a power derived from the usages of war. Kindred to the act in question in bad faith, is the breaking of his parole by a paroled prisoner.\n     While the United States were at war with Mexico, several officers of the Mexican Army were tried by a Military Commission composed of officers of the United States army and convicted and sentenced to be shot and executed for breaking their paroles. Numerous trials of a similar nature took place during the war of the Rebellion but there are no statutory provisions whatever upon the subject and the whole power of the military authorities in such cases is derived from the usages of\n\nwar. \n\n     On the 23rd of August 1865 a Military Commission duly appointed, assembled in the city of Washington for the trial of Henry Wirtz, who pleaded among other things that the Military Commission had no jurisdiction over either his person or over the subject matter of the charges and specifications, being a tribunal unauthorized by either statute, military law, or well established usage.\n     But this plea was overruled and he was convicted upon several charges, one of which was murder in violation of the laws and customs of war and after sentence he was hung for his crimes.\n     All the proceedings in this case derived their authority and validity from the common law of war."},{"pageid":69245,"pagefilename":"17f0e80794218ee629fed4c48323e65b.jpg","transcription":"Certain persons it will be remembered were tried and convicted in the same way for the assassination of President Lincoln.\n\n  Attorney General Steed in discussing this object (opinion Vol. II page 297) says that we have seen that when war comes, the laws and usages of war come also, and that during the war they are part of the laws of the land under the Constitution. Congress may define and punish offences against the laws, but in default of Congress defining those laws and prescribing a punishment for their infraction, and the mode of proceeding to ascertain whether an offence has been committed, and what punishment is to be inflicted - the Army must be governed by the laws and usages of war as understood and practiced by the civilized Nations of the world.\"\n   Again - \"If the prisoner be a regular unoffending soldier of the opposite party to the war, he should be treated with all the courtesy and kindness consistent with his safe custody. If he has offended against the laws of war, he should have trial and punishment as the laws of war require.\n   A spy, though a prisoner of war, may be tried, condemned and executed by a military tribunal without a breach of the constitution.\n   A Bushwacker, a Jayhawker, a bandit, a war rebel, an assassin - being public enemies - may be tried, condemned and executed as offenders against the laws of war.\" \n   The laws of Nations, which is the result of the experience and wisdom of ages has decided that Jayhawkers, bandits etc. are offenders against the laws of Nature & War, and as such amenable to the military.\n   Our Constitution has made these laws a part of the laws of the land ( see also Vattel 359, Wheaton's International Law 416, Woolsey's Int.

Milligan was the resident of a state not in Rebellion. The Courts were open an unobstructed for his persecution. He was neither a prisoner of war nor attached in any way to the military or naval service of the United States.\n   According to the instructions referred to, no civil tribunal has jurisdiction in the case disclosed by the papers before me.\n  \n Sec. 40 and 41 therefore are as follows:\n\n Sec. 40:  There exists no law or body of authoritative rules of action between hostile enemies, except that branch of the law of nature and Nations which is called the law and usages of war on land.\n\nSec. 41: All municipal law of the ground, on which Armies, or of the countries to which they belong, is silent and of no effect between Armies"},{"pageid":69246,"pagefilename":"ddf1ef345fb7f69f426b765793724d33.jpg","transcription":"160 [stamp]\nin the field.\n\n         Manifestly these rules are, to a great extent, if not altogether correct, for it cannot be pretended that an United States soldier is guilty of murder if he kills a public enemy in battle, which would be the care if the municipal laws was in force, and application to an act committed under such circumstances.  All the laws and customs of civilized warfare may not be applicable to an armed conflict with Indian tribes upon our Western frontier, but the circumstances attending the assassination of General [strike] Canby and Thomas, are such as to make their murder as much a violation of the laws of savage as of civilized warfare, and the Indians concerned in it fully understood the baseness and treachery of their act.\n         It is difficult to define exactly the relations of the Indian tribes to the United States, but as they have been recognized as independent communities for treaty making purposes, and as they frequently carry on organized and protracted wars, they may properly, as it seems to me, be held subject to those rules of warfare which make a negociation for peace after hostilities possible, and which make perfidy like that in question, punishable by military authority.\n         Doubtless the war with the Modocs is practically ended, unless some of them should escape and renew hostilities; but it is the right of the United States, as there is no agreement for peace, to determine for themselves, whether or not anything ought to be done for the protection of the country, or the punishment of crimes, growing out of the war.\n         Section 59. of said Instructions is as follows: -\n\n\"A prisoner of war remains answerable for his crimes committed against the captor's army or people, committed before he was captured and for which he has not been punished by his own authorities.\"\n\n         The conclusion therefore is, that a Military Commission may be appointed to try such of the Modoc Indians now in custody as are charged with offences against the recognized laws of war, and that if, upon such trial, any are found guilty, they may be subjected to such punishment as those laws require or justify.\n                                                                            (Sgd) George H.

It has never been urged by anyone, I believe, that Satanta had any claim to mitigation of the punishment awarded him, or was justly entitled to mercy of any kins, and his temporary release from the Penitentiary, was granted not from consideration to him [3 word underline], but as a kind of bribe to his tribe to cease depredating in Texas, and upon the pledge of the tribe that it would do so.\nHowever that [strike 2 words] In case it did not however Satanta was to be returned to the Penitentiary or \"others equal to him\".  The latter clause of this condition is of course worthless, as even Indians - unfortunately sometimes -  cannot be picked up and sent to the Penitentiary without a trial, and Indians convicted of raiding into Texas would hardly escape with the Penitentiary.   The question as to whether Satanta himself became hostile again or not, was not considered, and did not enter at all into the condition of his release.  There is no question as to Kiowas having raided in Texas since his release - and there is no question as to the course of Satanta, if the Indians had had a show of success.  Had he been so disposed, he could have come in with White House and other Kiowas, who"},{"pageid":69253,"pagefilename":"3cc930cfc36c654a6da3b375a350ddeb.jpg","transcription":"167\nasked to come in before the tribes had effected anything.  But he waits until every attempt of the Indians had failed, before he left them to come in to surrender.  It is not understood that Satanta himself complains that he is unjustly dealt with, neither does his tribe make such complaint.  This attempt to keep him out of the penitentiary is believed to originate with the same parties and in the same spirit that prompted the efforts made to the Governor of Texas to commute his original sentence of death to confinement in the Penitentiary for life and to which he modestly [strike] unfortunately yielded.\n\n                                                            (Sgd) C.

The Commr. of Indian Affairs is at present, inclined to think that it will not be best to send any members of the family, but that the punishment will be severer by a necessary separation, than it would if the families went with the offenders, besides the additional Expense which would necessarily be incurred.

Major Anderson was directed, on leaving Concha, that should the trails lead him to believe that a considerable body of Indians were camped West of his line of march, to detach a sufficient command to look them up. Capt. Bochen has since been directed on his march to the Fresh Fork to send two or three Seminole Negroes with fast led horses to ho into the Plains fifty miles West of the head of the Double Mountain Fork and endeavor to find such Camp. Should they be successful in finding a Camp, it might delay the movement of the Column from the Fresh Fork a few days. Respectfully submitted (Sgd) R. S.

I have not deemed it advisable to take any action in the case of Col. Davidson. He appears to be doing well and to be animated with a strong desire to do whatever is possible. The incompleteness of the affair at the Washita Agency is due probably to the unexpected attacks of what were considered friendly Indians and an uncertainty as to how far the defections had Extended. The attitude of the Washitas, Caddos and in fact all the quasi friendly bands at that Agency, was very wavering at that time. They were all mingled together with those who fired upon the troops, and the troops could not in many instances return the fire upon them unless they fired into the families, who were Endeavoring to get out of the way. Davidson also appears to have been uncertain how far he would be sustained in his action and anticipated, he tells me, that the Indian Dept. would complain of him, one object of his telegram, to Commissioner, he says, was to get the first hearing.\n    Although incomplete, the affair has had a good Effect, and it had better be regarded, I think, as a success.\n    It is understood by the Indians, by the Agent and by the Special Commissioner, whom I met here, Mr. Smith, that all Indians coming in are to be disarmed and to be subjected to such other conditions as the Government may impose. I think there a troops enough available here and at the Washita, to carry this out. If not, I can send for either Davidson's or Buell's Column.\n    I had intended to start for home on Tuesday next after the departure of Buell's column and after fitting myself out to return immediately to this point, to remain. But I think now I had better not leave at all. I shall send also down on Monday to San Antonio for such things as I need -- I have nothing with me -- just my travelling rig -- and take up my residence here for the present and until this matter is settled. After leaving what I can about the country, I have determined to locate Buell's Camp from which he shall operate, in Wanderer's Creek. This Creek is a small southern tributary of the Red and about 70 miles South of West from Fort Sill. You will readily find it on Davidson's map. I have been able to Effect an arrangement with the Trader here, by which he will deliver freight at that point for a Dollar a hundred.

I infer from what you say, that Miles and Price are not to come here at all unless by accident.

I sent the train there, in order to hasten matters, as it did in the case of Davidson's command, but owing to the high water, it will cause delay instead; it cannot be helped. Buelle is very impatient as well as myself, I really do not think, however, that this delay will be in the least detrimental, as the Indians are effected by the other other columns, they will fall back probably upon the Main road and Buell will be in good time to meet them.

I do not know iif you are aware of the arrangements already made for changing the 4th and 10th cavalry.\n                   The 4th is to go to Till the new post on or near  Mclelellan Creek and to Richardson.  The tenth to Concho, Mcthavett, Griffin, Davis and Stochton, and the Companies of the ninth, more coming in from the Indian country to take the place of the fourth at Clark and Duncan.   Giving to the unprecedented rains of this winter, the troops out cannot get in as soon as anticipated, and in consequence, the movements for exchange of Posts and for the establishment of the new Post may not commence as soon as contemplated--the first of March.  But they will commence so soon as the condition of the wades will warrant unless I receive orders to the contrary.  The movements referred to were determined upon under the direction of Lieut. General Sheridan.  A number of Comanches have recently gone to Mexico and will Endevor, I believe, to arrange for a residence there--finding it no longer safe on this side.  If they do we shay have a recurrence of raids from that side.  In a recent letter to General {F]uero the Mexican Commandandante at that frontier, I requested his interference to prevent this.  I am unable to course to say how far he may be willing or able to do anything.\n                   What few Comanches and Kiowas are now absent from Lill, are on the Pecos, at points from its mouth to the Guadelupe Mountains and I propose in the spring to start a column from Fort Clark"},{"pageid":69279,"pagefilename":"13af15cda51dcb7f57c37048476a52a0.jpg","transcription":"to clean that entire country. A summer camp will also be kept up at or near Mackinzie's supply camp.

If such concert cannot be arranged the dissatisfied Indians will all eventually find refuge in Mexico, and another pursuit of them into that country will, I fear be necessary to awaken the Mexican government to the necessity of taking action in the case. What I hear of General Fuero is highly favorable and induces a belief that a satisfactory concert of action can be arranged with him.\nThe one great difficulty, I fear, is that the people of Mexico on the frontier are reported as favorable to the residence of the Indians among them, as they find arising therefrom a profitable traffic in the blunder brought in by these Indians from their raids into our country. I hope, however, I will be found that General Fuero has the disposition and the force to overcome this difficulty.\nOur means of transportation is of course very much used up from its constant work on half forage since last July, and Contractor's transportation will be used for the movement of the regimental and company property of the troops moved, in order to give our animals a chance to recuperate for the approaching summer's work with the troops.\nI am General, very respectfully,\n\n   Your obedient servant,\n   (sgd) C.C.Augur\n  Brig.

I believe myself to have been the first to suggest last fall a change of the 10th Cavalry from Fort Sill and the sending the 4th Cavalry there in its place and I have that in my mind there was no question of Colonel Grierson in the case. His Regiment has occupied that Post since it was Established - six years - longer I believe thanof any other Cavalry Regiment in service has occupied a Post continuously. \nThe mere change of stations of the Regiment is not a righful  cause of complaint therefor, neither is it a hurtful change, as the Posts it will occupy are not unpleasant ones, and afford good opportunities for legitimate work. \nIn conversation about this change, I suggested to Gen’l Sheridan that I thought it bad policy to Keep all the Colored troops in the Army in one Department and mentioned that New Mexico would be a good place for a colored Regiment and if the 10th went there, Grierson would have Command of a District for which I thought him well qualified. \nMy reasons for thinking a change of troops at Fort Sill desirable were, as I have stated already, Entirely independent of any question concerning Col Grierson. I only regret that his Regiment did not go to New Mexico - not that I am not and have not been perfectly satisfied both with Col. Grierson and with his Refiment, but for the reason stated to the Lieut, General Sheridan that I think it a mistake to have all the Colored troops in one Department, and the 10th was in a position to make a change to New Mexico both convenient and useful and would give Col. Grierson Command of a District. \nI know Col. Grierson very well and have the Kindest feelings for him, and he need have no apprehensions of any injustice from me. I have no favorites. \nPersonally I should prefer to 10th to the 8th as I do not know well a single Officer in the latter Regiment, while I know well and have a great regard for nearly all in the 10th, which during the past summer has done most Excellent service.\n\nThe troops coming in from their summer Camps have had very severe weather and have suffered a great deal. We have lost too, a great many horses, owing to the impossibility of getting to them a proper supply of forage.

Senor, Your letter to me of September 23, 1874 was received here during my absence, and failed to receive at the time the attention it deserved.I take advantage of the return of Col. Williams to your city, to send by him this letter in reply. I regret to learn from your Communication that the Apache Indians have caused trouble to the people of your State, and that they constantly Evade their merited punishment by Escaping into this Country. I can sympathize with you in this matter, for a similar thing occurs whenever our troops pursue and attempt to punish these and other Indians guilty of murders and robberies on this side of the Rio Grande -- they flee into Mexico. I fear this state of affairs is unavoidable until our respective Governments arrive at some understanding as to the treatment of these Indians and are prepared to faithfully execute the terms of such understanding. While it is impossible for me to authorize or permit Mexican troops to enter our territory, I am prepared at any time to cooperate with such forces in any manner that may be thought most effective in preventing these Indians from entering Mexico at all, either for purpose of trade or for depredation, or for their punishment, in case they do as there. Those Indians belong to Reservations in New Mexico and whenever found by our people absent from such Reservation without authority, they are always regarded and treated as hostile. If your countrymen would do the same thing, and treat them as hostiles whenever they are found in your country, I doubt if they would go there so frequently. It is charged, I will not say with truth, that these Indians find in Mexico a market for all the horses and other property stolen from this side the river. I trust that Col. Williams will be ably assisted, as I am informed he is, by your powerful aid and countenance, to remove these Indians not only from your Country, but quite away from the Rio Grande frontier. I am informed Your Excellency desires a map of the U.S., particularly of that part contiguous to your own State. I take great pleasure in forwarding you this map by Col. Williams, who has kindly promised to deliver it into your hands. I hope at a future time to have the pleasure of meeting Your Excellency of expressing to you in person my respect for yourself and for your Country. I am very respfy. Your obdt srvt [(Sgd?)] C.C.

Sergeant Bush states that he was retained in service beyond the term of his enlistment by his post Commander Lt. Col. W. [R?] Shafter to force him to pay for a private horse the property of Lieut. Custer which it is alleged was lost through his, Sergeant Bush's negligence.   This complaint is substantially true.   It is sustained by the records of the Post (certified copies of which are herewith enclosed) and by the free admission of Lieut. Col. Shafter himself.\nI find the following to be the facts in the case.  On the 4th of December 1871, Sergeant Bush arrived at Fort McKavett, Texas, on his return from escorting the remains of the late Capt. Porter, [?A.Q.M.?] to San Antonio, Texas, on the10 of December Major Merriam 24th Infantry placed a private horse the property of Lieut Custer 24th Infantry in charge of Serg't Bush with instructions to take good care of the animal and turn him over to Lt. C. on the arrival of the escort at Fort Davis.  Serg't Bush was also instructed not to ride the horse or permit others to do so.   The Sergeant signed a receipt in due form for the horse and left McKavett the next day Dec 11th.\n\n  It appears that the Sergeant rode the animal part of the way after leaving Fort Concho.  He states in extenuation that the horse being tied to a wagon inhaled all the dust of the train, and was manifestly impaired and distressed thereby.   In consequence of this the Serg't concluded to ride him.       Upon leaving Central Station on the Staked Plains some Antelopes were seen and Sergeant Bush was induced to loan Corporal Spriggs of Company C 9th Cavalry the horse for the purpose of getting a shot at them.  Corporal Spriggs was gone an entire day and did not rejoin the Command until it had reached the crossing of the Pecos River.  He then reported that the animal had become frightened and had thrown him and escaped with saddle and bridle on, as the horse had since been caught and taken to Fort Concho, the Corporal's story is fully corroborated.  When Sergt Bush and his detachment reached Fort Stockton, he reported the facts to Lieut. Col. Merritt of the 9th Cavalry who advised to sustain his statement by the"},{"pageid":69290,"pagefilename":"b285244133db584340465f51bf9634b7.jpg","transcription":"1872\naffidavits of his men.  He accordingly made affidavit before the Adjutant of the 9th Cavalry Lieutenant John S. [Land?] and signed it himself. It was also signed by Corporal Spriggs.\nWith this paper as his justification he proceded to Fort Davis, reaching that post on the 21st of December one day after the term of the enlistment had expired.\nOn the next day, December 22nd the discharge of Sergeant Bush was made out in due form by the Company Commander Capt. [?Schriver] of the 9th Cavalry and presented to Lieut. Col. Shafter Post Commander for his signature. Lt.Col. Shafter declined to sign the discharge until he would investigate the loss of Lieut. Custer's horse. A fearful storm came up the next day and did a great deal of damage to the garrison. This engaged the attention of Lt.Col.Shafter for two or three days, but on the 25th December he again called up Sergt. Bush and being dissatisfied with his statement as to the loss of the animal, he ordered the Sergeant to the guard house as a prisoner, as the 1st Sergt supposed that Sergt Bush was a discharged man he had it seems issued no rations since the 22nd and none were given him in the guard house, at least none from the Company Mess. The Sergeant was released on the morning of the 26th after one day's confinement.\nOn the 25th Lieut. Col. Shafter wrote a letter which is herewith enclosed to Dept. Hqrs. to enquire if he could hold Sergt. Bush responsible before a Military Court for the loss of a Private Horse, the answer was in the negative, when the answer was received, Lt. Col.Shafter signed the discharge (January 6th 1872) as it was the same paper which had been previously handed him, it still retained the old date of December 22nd 1871  although the discharge took place on 6th of January, 72, it bears  date December 22nd, 1871.\nThe remarks on the Master Roll of Co.

In my opinion Company A had awarded it a much larger share of the post property than properly belonged to it if the division of property made by prior Council of which Capt French was senior member were just. By referring to the proceedings convened April 27 1871 page 89 it will be observed that these companies that were about leaving the post and that had equal claims on the Post Library that Co A had (unless the fact that Co A brought part of the books to the post while these companies brought none, gave to Co A claims superior to to theirs) got no share of the Post Library, or its value.

Of these articles there has been shipped since Jany. 1, 615 lbs of Hams and 1128 Cans of Tomatoes.

A shipment will soon be [?] to Fort McKavett of such articles remaining due as are on hand for shipment.  An extra shipment to Ft.

I do not deem it necessary to say anything in explanation of my course towards this officer except that the leniency with which he has been treated would not have been exercised towards him, were he not in the main, a very good officer.  The duty required of Capt. Norvell was but trifling, and Lieut.

Genl whose attention is invited to the endorsement of the Chf Qur. of the Dept.   This discussion as to the relative merits of Pack Saddles has been in progress since I have been in service, and seems as far from a satisfactory conclusion as ever.  I agree entirely with the QM General that no pack saddle can be procured that will not in the hands of careless and ignorant packers, injure the mules.  At the same time it is to be observed that what is known as the Regulation pack saddle requires much greater care and watchfulness on the part of the packers than the aparajo and those two qualities being generally wanting in the class of packer usually employed, accounts for greater frequency of injury to animals from that saddle.   Colonel Holabird's suggestion of having two good skilled packers at each post from which most scouting is done is regarded favorably and I propose to adopt it for those posts.  In my opinion the Aparajo is much superior to any other form of pack saddle, for among others the following reasons.  It admits of greater variety in size and shape of pack.  In Oregon I have packed on them, half barrels of pork, brine being drawn off, and boxes of hard bread with impunity to animals.  It could not have been done with regulation pack saddles, with it, the weight of pack is better distributed over the animal and the bearing surface greater.  The centre of gravity of the pack coincides more nearly with that of the animal, doing away with the great [?leverage?] unavoidable when packs are suspended from Xtrees [crosstrees?].  There is much less danger, none in fact, of injury to the animal from the pack itself.  In going through brush or narrow defiles or if the animal falls, the aparajo is a protection to it.  The original cost is probably greater, though they can be had on the line of Rio Grande for ten dollars each, but I believe they will outlast the same value in regulation pack saddle independently of the question of injury to animals.\nI respectfully recommend that Colonel Holabird be authorized to purchase one hundred aparajos for distribution to the posts where the skilled packers will be sent.  \nSept. 21, 72\nD.T.

Jackson states that, \"It is not customary to furnish companies with copies of Circulars relating exclusively to officers.\"  This is wrong, all instructions and directions concerning duty at a post affecting either officers or men, should be promulgated as orders and placed upon each company order book as prescribed by regulations.  If officers do not  see orders then it is their own fault and they can be held responsible for faults committed in consequence.   It is not believed these charges can be sustained under the circumstances, and even if they could, it is doubtful, if frequent recourse to Courts Martial - either for officers or enlisted men is conducive to the best interests of the service, which requires a conscientious performance of duty - not one constrained by fear of punishment.\nThere are of course officers and soldiers who are to be restrained only by fear, but the number is believed to be small.

Referring to the QM Genl's letter of Sept 25, 72 I have simply to remark that the irregularities complained of in the administration of the Quarter Master's Department in Texas, existed if at all some year or two before I came to the Department and that I know nothing of them except from common rumor - the same that  Mr. Baldwin refers to.\n[red ink] 1809"},{"pageid":69309,"pagefilename":"6acecf82301a3846797f8de8a208a33c.jpg","transcription":"[red ink] 1872\n\n The enclosed memorandum shows the prices prices [sic] paid for wood at Ft.

Colonel Holobird and myself and staff, are and have been active in our endeavor to detect irregularities and when found to at once correct them, and this I think will be more useful than investigating the truth of old rumors, which if verified could lead to no beneficial result.  A Cavalry Company is now at [?Rugget?] Barracks and is likely to remain there.  This will dispose of the corn there I believe.

Colonel MacKenzie's  operations and those of the escorts to Rail Road surveying parties have driven them from their haunts in and about Staked Plains, and they have gone to Mexico as a safe place from which to continue their depredations on the Texas frontier.  I enclose reports of two recent scouting parties who followed the trail of depredating bands to where they crossed into Mexico with their plunder.  I also enclose copy of letter from an American Merchant in Presidio del Norte giving reliable information concerning those Indians and their location in Mexico.  If these Indians are permitted to remain in Mexico it will be impossible to prevent their continual raiding into Texas.

I entirely concur in opinion with the petitioners as to the good results likely to grow out of the construction of a railroad from Austin to the Rio Grande, not only in settling and developing the country through which it passes, but in the increased facilities afford the Government in protecting & quieting the Rio Grande frontier now and for the last twenty five years harassed and despoiled by the depredating Indians and Mexicans.  Ft. Clark near the Rio Grande is two hundred and six miles from Austin, the nearest railroad point through this post, from the necessity of the case must pass its own supplies and those for Forts Duncan, Stockton, Davis, Quitman and Bliss, averaging  probably over four million pounds yearly.  Besides in the event of such a railroad being completed San Antonio, with Ft. McIntosh and probably Ruggles Barracks would be supplied by it at a great saving of time and expense.  But more valuable in my judgement would be it bearing upon our border relation with Mexico.

Doubleday's complaint of the non payment of his command is hardly fair, the records of this office show that the troops have been regularly paid every two months (since I have been Chief Paymaster) with the exception of the 31 December payments, when owing to the \"Epizootic\" it was impossible to procure transportation to Ft. Brown and some other of the posts in the Dept.  As soon as transportation could be obtained a paymaster was sent to pay at Ft. Brown as the Dept. Commndr. is aware.  In the enclosed extract Col.

The records of this office show that the petitioners a/cs were paid very regularly and that none of them have from three to four months pay due unless it is Dr. Davis who I am informed drew from Major       [?Gleason?]  Mar 12, 1873 his pay for June 1872, leaving at this date some nine months still due him, so that he certainly did not suffer from the long absence of the Paymaster.

Col. 4 Cav.\nRespectfully forwarded to the Adjt Genl.of the Army (thro Hq Mil Div. of the Mo.) for action of the War Dept.  The facts in this case appear from further inquiry to be as follows:  Capt. Hooker was ordered out with his Company on duty in a country entirely unknown to him, and refused a guide - I think imprudently - After leaving the post and about a mile from it he met Mr. Cloud who had been the post guide and engaged him to accompany his command as guide and for his services gave the enclosed voucher.  I am satisfied from enquiry that Mr. Cloud went in good faith and I think he should be paid.  If Captain Hooker exceeded his authority in hiring him, he should be the one to suffer and not Mr. Cloud.   It would appear that there was a bitter feud between Capt. Hooker and his C.O. Lt. Col.

These tickets called for 21 ounce loaves hence 6699 ½  lbs of flour.  33 1/6 Brls have been saved and the money collected.  This saving of 33 ½ Brls from 118 1/2 Brls is about as great a saving as can be expected from a small bakery using not much more than 1/2 Brl per day.  I do not think there is any loss in the Flour.  I would however call attention to one point which seems to have escaped the attention of the Post Comdr and the Post Council.  33 1/6 Brls of Flour brought but $229.59 hence the flour savings have been sold at  $6 88/100 pr. barrel.  The average price of flour has been for those months $9 95/100 per barrel, a loss of $101 82/100 has been sustained in the value of the savings.  This loss added to the amount collected $229.59 would have made the proper savings about $330.41 approximating to the amount ($400/) the Post Commander estimated should have been realized.  It is probable that the leakage exists in the low price at which the Council has fixed the price of Bread Viz. 5[cents sign] per ration loaf of 21 ounces.

The Proceedings of the Council as recorded are certainly not very clear and afford no data for deciding whether proper savings have been made or not.  The endorsement of the Chf.

Savings of Bakehouse never exceed in practice thirty percent - hardly can come up to it.  2d 21 ounces of bread cannot be sold for five cents with proper gain for Post Fund.  If Capt.

Frey's telegram was the first intimation received here, that it had been sent to Ft. Griffin. Orders were sent to Col. Buell, Comdg. that Post to have it returned at once to Camp Supply. Before this order reached him he sent it on with two companies of the 4th Cav to Ft. Concho, where Lt. Col. Merritt ordered it on with these Co's to Ft. McKevett. As soon as this was known, Lt. Col. M. Cook  was directed to have it returned at once to Camp Supply.  But before this order reached him he had sent it with the same Cos. to Ft. Clark. I cannot conceive the possibility of its being sent further and orders have been sent to him to have it returned immediately.  I cannot help thinking the officer in charge of this transportation has failed to represent fully and earnestly to the Officers sending it on, the great inconvenience that would result to Camp Supply.  Capt. Sanderson Comdg. Ft. Silll at the time is a careful and attentive officer and was honestly led I believe by the terms of the order he refers to, but I cannot understand the action of the other Comdg. officers, if they were aware of the great need of this transportation at Camp Supply.  They have all been called on for explanation.  I have been hurrying them up as much as possible to get the balance of MacKenzie's Regt. to him much needed at this time - and they were probably short of transportation for the emergency which they may have regarded sufficiently imminent to justify the use they made of the transportation.  This case fully exemplifies the great inconvenience we are subjected to here by reason of the entire absence of telegraphic communication with interior posts, and our insufficient mail with Forts Concho and McKevett, we have a triweekly communication with Ft. Clark, Duncan, Stockton and posts above, a semi-weekly & with Griffin a mail communication but once a week.  At this season of rains and high water, even this limited service is constantly interrupted.  Should affairs on the Rio Grande render it necessary arrangements will be made with Col.

Keyes should be tried on some of the charges preferred against him to do so at this time when the services of the officers necessary for a Court are essential in the field, would, it is feared, cause greater injury to the service than that likely to be corrected by it.  Under these circumstances it is directed that he be released from arrest and ordered to his company.\n\n   While Capt Keyes escaped a trial, he must understand that his conduct in this whole transaction from first to last is not approved.\n   Lieut. Col. Buell's arrangement for making his scouts effective by contracting baggage and limiting transportation was soldierly and eminently proper, and it was the duty of Capt. Keyes, being in command of a company to have been one of the first to set the example of ready and cheerful obedience.\n   In the field after Indians is no place for officers to make or stand upon small points, or to permit their personal or professional preferences to interfere with the dispositions or desires by the Cmdg Officer, and no thorough soldiers will do so.  It is believed that Capt Keyes has cause of complaint that Lt. Col. Buell took action against him on the report of another officer without ascertaining such to be the fact, the Genl. Comd'g believes Lt. Col. Buell to have been misled by the report of Lt. Cratt and thinks he erred in not sending for the officers referred to and learn from them direct their real intent and purposes.

The question as to whether Satanta himself became hostile again or not, was not considered, and did not enter at all into the conditions of his release.   There is no question as to Kiowas having raided in Texas since his release, and there is no  question as to the course of Satanta if the Indians had not a show of success.  Had he been so disposed he could have come in White Horse and other Kiowas, who asked to come in before the troops had effected anything but he waits until every attempt of the Indians had failed, before he left them to come in and surrender.

Their families I think should go with the men, not as an indulgence to men themselves, but as a matter of humanity to the family.

It is unquestionably true that the establishment of a military post in the locality indicated in the within letter would be of very great importance to that frontier.  \n\n I have heretofore discussed with Lt. Genl Sheridan the question of moving either Ft Griffin or Ft Richardson as troops cannot be spared from other posts - to a point on Beaver Creek, a tributary of of [sic] the Wichita, and better adapted than that river for the purpose and if an appropriation of eighty (80) thousand dollars can now be obtained to build the post, I will recommend that Ft. Griffin be transferred to that point.  Ft. Griffin has been and is now, an important post and I could recommend a change in its location only in the expectation that the new post would cover the same country and protect the same interests.  Settlers are already getting in advance of it, and if it were transferred to the Beaver, there is much fine country between, that would soon fill up.  the Beaver is about the limit of probably settlement in that direction, and a post there would be in advance of any considerable settlement probably for many years.  Ft. Griffin too, can be abandoned without any considerable loss"},{"pageid":69346,"pagefilename":"8d3ffae8d193f6619e1f8792a67f2350.jpg","transcription":"and the owner is now laying of a town and selling lots almost within the post.

On my return Capt Holgate was not in a condition to be tried.\n\n  He subsequently was placed in the Sisters' Hospital here where he has since remained under the daily supervision of Surgeon Hammond, the Medical Director of the Dept who has given much and careful attention to this case.  He now thinks Capt. Holgate is cured and that he will able hereafter to control his appetite for liquor.  Capt.

While I do not share  this confidence I do respectfully recommend that Capt. Holgate be not tried by Court Martial this time.   In fact I do not think he could be tried at all for his conduct at Ft.

Neither do I believe from the opinion Dr. Hammond now has of his condition, and of his ability hereafter to restrain himself from overindulgence in liquor, that he could be retired.   If the Secty is prepared to entertain the conditional resignation herewith enclosed, I respectfully recommend that Capt Holgate be ordered to Willetts' Point where he can be in the performance of his legitimate duties under officers of his own corps, and be subject to the restraints of strict military routine, and where it can be ascertained if he overestimated his strength in this matter.

Genl D.T. - There is no question as to the fact that Lt. Floyd did sell or dispose of a Spencer Carbine as alleged in within Statement of J. L. Humfreville, but it is doubtful if the Carbine belongs to the Government.  If it did, I am satisfied from all I heard in the case that Lt. Floyd was not aware of it.   It would seem that the Carbine was claimed by the late Lt. Vincent, 9 Cav. killed at the Howards Wells affair in April 1872, and into possession of Lt. Floyd from him on the supposition that it was private property.  The best evidence of this - amongst other - is that Lt. Floyd traded off the Carbine publicly in the presence of officers and men of his company, and his company commander, which he would hardly have done, if he had any reason to suppose it public property.  It would appear also that Humfreville supposed so at the time else why did he make no report, nor take any action in the case which he naturally would have done - at least his duty required it of him - had he seen his subordinate selling arms belonging to the Government.   But nothing is said about it until after Lt. Floyd appears as a witness in charges preferred agains Humfreville - even then he makes no written charge agains him, but makes vain allegations and holds them in terrorum over the head of Lt. Floyd during the time he is witness on his trial.  After the propagation of his sentence, Humfreville states verbally to Capt. Russell the Actg Asst. Insp. Genl. the substance of these charges and is informed he must put charges in writing, and give names of witnesses that the case may be investigated.  He fails to do so at the time he subsequently sends the charges to the Adj't. General.\nI believe from all I can learn of the case that Lt.

D H Floyd, 9 Cav, referred to me January 29, 75.  I have the honor to report as follows:  1st As to the sale of a Government Carbine by Lt. Floyd.  In the matter I have no direct proof at hand, and can but express the opinion which I have formed, from hearing of the matter in various ways, during the past year.  In April 1874, while at Ft. Brown on an inspection tour, Mr. Humfreville (just after his dismissal from the Army) stated to me that he knew that Lt. Floyd had a time long past, sold a Gov't Carbine; I told Mr. Humfreville that before taking any official notice of such a statement, I wished it in writing and names of witnesses &c (no statement in writing was furnished me).  Subsequently I mentioned this verbal \"statement\" to the Dept. Cmdr (then at Ft Brown) who said that he would not entertain charges made in this manner by an exofficer just dismissed against one of his accusers unless fully substantiated by testimony.  Lt. Floyd on the 27 of May 1874, tendered his resignation which was subsequently withdrawn under circumstances fully set forth in communication (and enclosure) to the A. Genl. USA from these Headqrs dated Sept 3, 1874 in reply to inquiries from the War Dept (marked LS 673 D.T.  74 - enclosed herewith).  At the time when the mind of Lt. Floyd was found to be deranged (in Austin about Aug 1st) he frequently mentioned to me the matter about the carbine in question.   From conversation with him and from the general reputation of Lieut. Floyd I then formed the opinion (which I still hold) that Lt. Floyd did sell a carbine to a citizen about the time stated, that, if the carbine was a Govt Carbine, the fact was not known to Lt. Floyd:  that the Carbine came into the possession of Lt. Floyd as private, and not public property:  that there was no secrecy or attempt to conceal the sale of the carbine from any one, that he sent for the carbine for the purpose of showing it to the Dept. Comdr. to prove that it was not a Govt carbine;  that through the feeling of his inability to prove a negative in the case of the carbine his sensitive organization, and the idea that several suspected him, Lt. Floyd's mind  became seriously affected; and that, in"},{"pageid":69352,"pagefilename":"958e31a461f5115e8835e67b954ef3ee.jpg","transcription":"consequence of such derangement of mind he resigned.  Attention is invited to the fact that the alleged sale took place in Nov 1872, and no report as far as I am informed, was made of the same by Capt Humfreville until he had been dismissed the service (more than a year after).  As to the Statement made by Mr. Henry Warren (not signed) it, being merely hearsay, is not considered testimony, and the statement cannot be investigated properly by me, unless some officers should be ordered to Weatherfords, Tx. to obtain statement of Bell Bros and Mr. \"Tige\" Littlefield, and without the detailed statement of J. S. Humfreville and Amelato Montez (whose whereabouts is unknown)\n2nd.  As to the charge, that Lt. Floyd \"Knowingly made false accusations against Cap. J. S. Humfreville, charging him with drunkeness &c in Dec 1872 I am unable to fully investigate this allegation, in this city, but have the honor to state the records show that the matter of the charges against Capt. Humfreville, was fully investigated by Capt. C.D.Emory 9 Inf. Judge Adv. of this Dept., and the result of his investigation finally forwarded to the Adjt Genl USA on the 21st of Feby 1874.   Finally, holding the opinion, that Lt. Floyd intended no wrong to the Gov't or injustice to Capt. Humfreville, in either of the alleged transactions, no further action is recommended.  If it is desired, however, that the testimony of all the witnesses mentioned in the accompanying papers be taken, orders are respectfully requested with authority also to allow Lt.

The number of enlisted men of the Division actually on the field was therefore about 3013.\n\n   As my division came upon the field I was directed to place it on the left of Crawford's Brigade and toward Cedar Mountain.  Subsequently Crawford's Brigade joined his Division on the right of the line, and I was directed to move my command - to place it in two lines with its right resting on the road leading to Orange C.H. and its left extending in the direction of Cedar Mountain.  Knapps Battery retained its original position near the centre of the line.  McGilberry's Battery was planted on the extreme left of the line and Robinsons intermediary.  My command kept this position during the severe artillery fire of the afternoon, the Infantry only taking advantage of the ground in its vicinity to cover itself from the enemy shell.

On the right of the Orange road was a forest extending perhaps a quarter of a mile along the road and behind which was massed the Infantry of the enemy's left.  On the left was Cedar Mountain so that in advancing my Division would pass between the two.  I had previously caused Capt Pitchers Battalion of 8th and 12th Regulars to deploy as skirmishers and cover the front of the whole Division - to advance continuously, discover the enemys position and annoy him as much as possible.  How well this was done will be seen by the following extract [crossed out: report of] from a letter from Genl Prince written on the 16th of August from Richmond.  Speaking of Pitchers Battalion He says \"Their part I have occasion to know excited the admiration of the enemy, who enquired if they were not regulars, as they had never seen such skirmishing.  They were out during the whole battle and penetrated even to the enemys position and annoys him so as to turn the attention of his guns away from more distant firing with shot and shell and cause him to waste"},{"pageid":69363,"pagefilename":"844c8b39cf2568683efe5e6221f18465.jpg","transcription":"canister upon the ground of the skirmishers.\"\n\n    When the Infantry of Williams Division on our right advanced and became engaged I was ordered to cause my Battery in front to cease their firing and to advance my Infantry.

I then caused Prince's Brigade to advance in like manner on the left which it did under its gallant leader handsomely and in good order and when in position opened its fire   Meantime the enemy had gotten a battery in position on our left and a body of Infantry evidently by having gone around Cedar Mountain and were in position to annoy us extremely.

Meantime the enemy had placed a section of artillery in front evidently for the purpose of using grape upon our advancing infantry.  I saw too a large body of Infantry collecting for its support.  I sent immediately for a section of Napoleon guns to act upon this body and selected its position in front.  Before its arrival my horse was shot and a moment after I was wounded myself and rendered unable to keep the field.

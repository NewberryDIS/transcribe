We were mercifully spared from suffering during the severe cold of Jan. 7, 8, and 9th.  The papers tell of 28 persons frozen to death in the western part of this state.  A good many about here were frost bitten -- ears, nose cheeks hands or feet.  A good many hogs and some cattle men frozen to death.  One man about seven miles south lost 7 or 8 cows.  The greater number of cattle about here have no shelter except wind-breaks and some have sheds where they can get shelter.  And with 3 to 5 days of strong north wind with the mercury merging from 0 to 18 or 20 below zero it was a terrible strain on man and beast.

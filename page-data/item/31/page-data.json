I shall commence on the 18th of May 1841. After a painful parting with you and our friends we retired to the cabin which we found nearly full of Irish Dutch or English, who were preparing their supper, which they spread upon the cabin table and eat with much apparent enjoyment. We took tea with the Captain whom we found to be quite a jovial sort of a man. he told us that he was going to take his wife on board, as soon as he came to his farm which lay on the banks of the river, and give her a sail for her health, and she would be some company for us. We did not, however, reach the farm before night and were thus deprived of the lady's society. Her health not permitting her to venture out at so late an hour. The steamboat on which we sailed was called the Commerce and at that time had five boats in tow which were well laden and prevented our going fast. We retired at an early hour with severe headaches which after a night of sound sleep was entirely dispersed. \n19th When we arose we found that we had proceeded but unknown toward Troy, You will remember that when we left N.Y. we unknown rain at least every other day.

They cast a long shadow \nin the water, which was quite calm and smooth, making it appear as black \nas night. We watched a long time to catch a glimpse of the Anthony's nose, which \nis a point in the rocks, said to bear an exact resemblance of a man's Nose. \n20th We were awakened about three, with the news that the boat would \nland in Albany, which we did not expect. We were soon prepared to go \non shore, and leaving our baggage on board to proceed to Troy, we proceeded to \nMrs Moseleys in Hamlinton St at the foot of which we were landed.

Coming home it \nwas delightfull the birds were singing the frogs croaking and numerous insects \nwere humming & buzzing about not excepting the mosquitoes. When I came to the top \nof the hill I was delighted with the scene I had to stop my horse and gaze upon \nit, to my left and right were thickets that contained many small poplar \ntrees which are now very green before was was a large flat through which run \nmany brooks which causes the grass to grow very fast near the brooks the grass is of \na lighter green than on unclearmaking it appear very handsomely shaded\na little to the right ahead is our Charles house with the storks? outhouses &c to the \nleft lay Louises field which is spread on the side of a gently sloping hill near \nthe field on the grass Louises cattle were straying. Along was seen riding a young\nman horse back and to crown the picture from an opposite direction rode \na young lady followed by two gentlemen descending the hill. What a good \ncommencement for a Novel. Now my horse must take fright just as the Lady & \ngentleman meet on a small bridge, the gent jumps from his horse to the rescue \nthe other gentlemen come running up and ha! ha!! ha!!! fill it out as you please \nbut dont laugh at my rude attempts to describe our beautiful scenery. the two\ngents were Olliver and John Pettengale? who was coming here to get some proper? \nWe got home without any axcident eat some boiled chicken supper. Mama\ntold us that Louis & Charles had gone to Rockford, that Mr. Hill had been here \nand talked of buying Charles claim. Mama told him that Papa calculated to enter \nit and said if he swaped claims Erastus (for that was the way they were to \ntrade) he ought to lose his claim as he knew all the circumstances. He said he should \nnot take it till he saw Papa. He said Erastus wanted to change because he \nwas afraid Papa would enter it. Olliver & I spent the evening which we lengthened \nout to 11 o clock in playing backgammon or blackgammon as he says.

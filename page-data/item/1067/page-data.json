Mr. Pohlman\nDr. Brother\n\n                It would gratify me very much if you or your people could do something for him (young man).  He has come all the way from Canada to come here to Albany to get to some school.  Ever since he was 4 years old he has been among the whites, he thinks he is not sufficiently educated to be an instructor for his own people.\n       He has been with me for 8 weeks now ans as I have no means to aid him myself I take this course to acquaint the friends in Albany that they might do something for him.  I hope the rest of the Clergy will do something too.\n       I request you will be kind enough to interest your congregation in his behalf tomorrow should you deem\n\n[along left side of page]\nI want to get him to go to school in the city.\n\n\n\n\n box Ayer N.

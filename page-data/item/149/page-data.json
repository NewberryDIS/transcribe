Mr. Davies wrote me in regard to the purchase of the \"Cenhadwr.\" Some, he said, advised him to have it published in an office, same as the \"Cyfanill?.\" I advised him by all means to buy the whole office and control the workmen, as the cheapest in the long run. By adding a few modern Job Fonts he could get considerable work outside, and as work into a good business. I thought of the Bourgeois, and that you had no use for it, suggested that he print the first form in that type, and make as few changes in its appearance as possible. The material is old and would bring but little in any other way.

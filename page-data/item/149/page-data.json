Is that the Bourgeois bought for \"Uncle Tom's Cabin?\" If it is, the type is over 25 years old; but type used on hand presses, and used carefully as material on the \"Cenhadwr\" were used, will last many years longer than on power presses. New Bourgeois is worth here about 40 cents per lb. - yours I think, ought to bring about 1/2.

I advised him by all means to buy the whole office and control the workmen, as the cheapest in the long run. By adding a few modern Job Fonts he could get considerable work out-side, and so work into a good business. I thought of the Bourgeois, and that you had no use for it, suggested that he print the first form in that type, and make as few changes in its appearance as possible.

The Address will be delivered and Friday evening the exercises will close - I should like to have you here to take charge of the exercises on Wednesday eve as the music of that evening will be made by the Choir & Hitchcock is gone and I have to take his place and lead the choir and shall have to be in the singers seats most of the time on Friday evening. The Marietta Band furnish us with music - I think it will do you good here to deliver the address not have it long - say about three fourths of an hour - and commit to memory - if you can. Is Myron coming to live with me? if so I wish to know it - if he comes and I am prosperous and have my health, I will put him upon a person"},{"pageid":40998,"pagefilename":"41b7123e2dda5c5f7bc3111ffc21f6f7.jpg","transcription":"after he is thoroughly educated if he desires and his health will permit of it. What is Lydia going to do? I should write to Sarah and her about it if I had time, but Miss W. is sick and Abby and I have to man the School & we get little time for such things to do. I have been in School 10 hours, and this evening had a singing and sang over half hours and even at this hour of the night am writing to you. I think Lydia had better come out with you & Sarah. She can finish whatever she desires with Sarah and probably you or I can find her a place for teaching after awhile - She could have quite a number of small scholars - Enough I think to more than pay her way - and you and Sarah would not want to be bothered with them. and if the School goes right probably in the course of a year you could give her a situation here.  unclear - Gov. Requier told me tonight that you told him you could not be here till the last of August - My advice to you is come now soon - and Sarah and Myron & Lydia can come together or Myron can come with you, and Sarah and Lydia can come together. My school in Salsburg commences on the 30th of Aug & I shall have to start from here as soon as possible after I get through - as soon as the 10th of Aug & probably before so that if you do not come before the time that the unclear days you will not find us here and I have some business here that I must leave with you to settle - and if Sarah wishes to see us she must come the moment her school is done - She can get all ready and leave as soon as it is done and get here before we go probably - and unless Myron gets here before unclear he cannot go with us - I shall send most of my things instead"},{"pageid":40999,"pagefilename":"61b15e388245f610686671cc33e3e232.jpg","transcription":"of selling them for nothing, as I can carry between all three horse and all for less than forty dolls - I shall send Jesse with most of my heavy things & my horse in about 2 weeks, as the freight will be cheaper.

I have not time to give you any advice as to your future course. I was in hopes that you would have wisdom so sufficient about you to come out here before I left that I might give you the wealth of my experience, but as you have done differently I do not see but that you must grope your way in dark as I have done. In reference to a Music Teacher, all that I can tell you is that Miss Franks will not do. The People will not send their Scholars to her. Miss Cicel might give the Lessons - but you then loose the tuition, & also would loose the Music Club from the School - I must confess that I don't admire your arrangement for Teachers. The Primary department I could cut loose from The School - it now amts to nothing since Helen left it , it has cost me more than $100 out of Pocket- in fact it has done nothing since Josephine Stedman had it - She broke it up - and I believe she will break up any school. However much you may think of her as a woman, don't be fooled as to think, that hence, she is a good Teacher. And again I hope she will treat you differently from what she has me - her bills for her school amounted to about $70 dolls. I took them and gave her sixty-six dolls for them - twenty-five dolls of them I shall never get a cent of  & for collecting most of the rest it has cost me 10 per cent. While she was teaching she was in school and for this I charged her only half price. When she left here I gave her $20, I know I overpaid her, but could not stop to go down to the house and get the Books, and see- it has run along till now  as she had not been"},{"pageid":41003,"pagefilename":"4041a96f83ba04ae3075dac4c7423f8b.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41007,"pagefilename":"49004b1d2477a94c205067a748f43f70.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41008,"pagefilename":"956d2c77a1a8525c1a2d247ee029ff01.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41009,"pagefilename":"3143c94c8f379fc3dad22850016a527c.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41010,"pagefilename":"d769122d1bad0dedf7e5ab922374edbe.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41011,"pagefilename":"1afcd834785732e38cde4bac4df2ea7b.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41012,"pagefilename":"76c2d5b28bb01180ff394c18c7959e36.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41013,"pagefilename":"0a2e161ae7c28b27d82cae277598f5b0.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41014,"pagefilename":"124dbe6bedb7fc27a9f8325fe45828c7.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41015,"pagefilename":"51f27e55177511a2d6e3259b121af6fd.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41016,"pagefilename":"ab4331ce0b4c601034d52a923fb2b608.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41017,"pagefilename":"84ac5141d6c5cfa906a8e7fb7df4f01b.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41018,"pagefilename":"ee60f91ccf5fba9051f098e02a6b8d87.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41019,"pagefilename":"d3a3d01957fb07d7f3b31d8da48f1f8b.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41020,"pagefilename":"9c26e9ce82e2b4d39339038b19135324.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41021,"pagefilename":"6afda02f0db19b2b59a030991ce3e231.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41022,"pagefilename":"71b205ee09aeb295a2a4095bc83d1403.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41023,"pagefilename":"e1da97bfc265d6a4c7a6d0c40b6d7393.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41024,"pagefilename":"587cdb7689188d131ce4dae5d7c6d0cc.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41025,"pagefilename":"c4e9c14cc0df368e1c516a539278fdbe.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41026,"pagefilename":"f7e3b4016583fb01380704ecc6c34c7b.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41027,"pagefilename":"31a8503f46d2b47949f956f3f4804b88.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41028,"pagefilename":"c057f92f1d339100bd84918f1000cc87.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41029,"pagefilename":"60e3d44789a76d3114a94ed117cd0504.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41030,"pagefilename":"88d3d53aa162c3cd02024db09500f56e.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41031,"pagefilename":"42dd9df28fa3b1b4db6cc867456b0701.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41032,"pagefilename":"70e1623bce89b6d907ee9a70379ce058.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41033,"pagefilename":"b12ff079e0b6f5a4f6c6a209d0dd5dc9.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41034,"pagefilename":"2bfe7f0e5abc08bfe33edf46da579705.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41035,"pagefilename":"315a0ec5a1b3f9591ea2f9e32675ef9a.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41036,"pagefilename":"223f53a46671c50b85722ba9f5eb1e64.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41037,"pagefilename":"8ef58469a451c4e909592dc6563d0464.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41038,"pagefilename":"477a7596102a612531156f17caf75e0e.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41039,"pagefilename":"4b2c63946a938c6c591af386f0021f5e.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41040,"pagefilename":"2edaa226f368abdaa1f937acde942681.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41041,"pagefilename":"f93145b0f7a03cb9b674abc5dcb82cbd.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41042,"pagefilename":"c3e6c9656cc8947e722f93fdf47f74b0.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41043,"pagefilename":"be6a90f2995bc9f785317c1f00d674ae.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41044,"pagefilename":"5296d64fa9c93cdcc7fca8e28d24161e.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41045,"pagefilename":"4ff5fcf27a8f53d4ab383d509da3387e.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41046,"pagefilename":"c938911797af6b944875f86ce9d83b3a.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41047,"pagefilename":"e7d376fd7de8b17a3da57a5c4b9d7673.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41048,"pagefilename":"c25fa34acca5321030f23e6e43b45bb7.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41049,"pagefilename":"b53fad20d3e772c864e168b18b064610.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41050,"pagefilename":"740130a3a73cd03569bccd3438c1bfb9.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41051,"pagefilename":"18822d52a0a39cae20c9559bc60e35f4.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41052,"pagefilename":"bbac266150df14877ded32126bcdcdeb.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41053,"pagefilename":"ed5b3183b2e3aa55984c3af4cdfc0cbe.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41054,"pagefilename":"bca45ccdc2a2bed5b674adb757850134.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41055,"pagefilename":"b19c4d97b6cc9b80afcd45f471344d9c.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41056,"pagefilename":"f0b5dbd17dfeee30b1c6a7ea298549f9.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41057,"pagefilename":"f545b55776611777133d5aeaa19326d7.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41058,"pagefilename":"9c99a54c7135005323b2a4648ec2345c.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41059,"pagefilename":"2c1c6d2ed92d516262deb5c85673cdd2.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41060,"pagefilename":"1f194d48d8d6fc275c2259d6974d1f38.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":41061,"pagefilename":"b5b84fdb040

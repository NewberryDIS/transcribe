I have not time to give you any advice as to your future course. I was in hopes that you would have wisdom so sufficient about you to come out here before I left that I might give you the wealth of my experience, but as you have done differently I do not see but that you must grope your way in dark as I have done. In reference to a Music Teacher, all that I can tell you is that Miss Franks will not do. The People will not send their Scholars to her. Miss Cicel might give the Lessons - but you then loose the tuition, & also would loose the Music Club from the School - I must confess that I don't admire your arrangement for Teachers. The Primary department I could cut loose from The School - it now amts to nothing since Helen left it , it has cost me more than $100 out of Pocket- in fact it has done nothing since Josephine Stedman had it - She broke it up - and I believe she will break up any school. However much you may think of her as a woman, don't be fooled as to think, that hence, she is a good Teacher. And again I hope she will treat you differently from what she has me - her bills for her school amounted to about $70 dolls. I took them and gave her sixty-six dolls for them - twenty-five dolls of them I shall never get a cent of  & for collecting most of the rest it has cost me 10 per cent. While she was teaching she was in school and for this I charged her only half price.

How many times I have wished I could see you & have a long talk  with you but I suppose I must be deprived of the privelege of them for the present.

This is the annual examination and we expect a large audience; hear of many that are coming from different parts. I dread it some, for I have a composition of about five pages to read; subject \"Study of Nature\" and there has been a political Colloquy composed for the occasion in which each scholar takes a part; hope we shall all succeed in everything we undertake so as to bring honor upon ourselves, but am afraid I shall fail. It takes place the last Wednesday in this month (the 29th I believe). Want you should come very much if your school is through so that you can; come down to Phillipston and then come with Uncle Kendall's girls; they would like to come and I will return home with you if I do not go to Pembroke, but if I do cannot, as I shall have no vacation as fall term commences there the 5th of August. Mother is at Albany; have heard from her since she went there by way of brother Erasmus; expects to return home the last of this month. Have heard from Edwin several times this summer; am going to write him to come here at the close of the school if possible. Also have heard from Lydia and she likes her school much and do really hope that she will succeed well in it. Raymond thinks of remaining at Norwich University as a teacher this fall. Rebecca was here the first of the term but she had to go home on account of her limbs and I have missed her much.

In regards to what you wrote about the\nproposals Raymond made you I want you to do what you think\nwill make you happiest and be the best for you. I know Sister\nAbby is good and sincere in what she written to you upon the\nsubject and that she would do all she could to make you happy\nbut I do not think Raymond is able now to take upon himself\n(I do not know to be sure how he stands in the world in regard to his pecuniary\nmatters) what he proposes to you and I know your feelings too well\nto think you would feel as independent there as you would to live\nby yourself and the difference existing between your religious views\nand theirs and being so far from scenes and place of your past-\nlife might be sources of unhappiness to you, but you must weigh\nthe subject deeply and act as you think best. I think it would be\nbest for Jesse perhaps to go and live with Brother R - for then he\nwould have some one to watch over him and protect him and I\nknow he and Abby would be kind to him and do all they could\nfor him; as for Myron Nathan and myself will look after him.\nI do not intend staying this way any longer than duty seems to"},{"pageid":41105,"pagefilename":"fcde119f9a38d8cc8e7999644e364469.jpg","transcription":"Sarah\nrequire, for living here is not congenial with my feelings and never has been and I cannot think of doing it any great length of time. If I live, shall return to New England in two years at most from this time with the intention of staying there and think if you conclude to remain there you had better stay where you are if Mr. Miller will rent the house to you until one or both of us return and keep Myron with you and watch over him and bring him up the best you can. Will send you soon money to pay his tuition this fall and to get him books for the Winter if he needs any. Wish him to pay close attention to ciphering, writing and spelling and be a good boy in all things - tell him so from me. If at any time you should need any money don't be afraid to let me know it -for if I am well I shall have it to spare you. Intend on my return establishing a school somewhere myself and should like Sister's cooperation unless she wishes to go and stay with Raymond or should be married in the meantime. After receiving a letter from her shall write her all about these things. Hope to write to David and Jesse soon; suppose they hear from us through you and you must always write us about them. Should think cousin Sarah would write me a she did not know where she should be this fall when I left. Hope I shall get time to write to Roeana, Mrs. Stone and other relatives and friends before long. You must remember me to all friends in Phillipston. Give my love to Mr. Miller & family - how much I should like to see them all. How much I would give to enjoy the privilege of visiting the burying ground in P__ to night and coming to see you and finding sister there. The Miniatures we took with us are a great satisfaction to us but I will write no more this time. Affectionately Sarah [later Weaver]\n[left-hand side] Monday night= Oc 16th Have received a letter today from Cousin Sarah and it was such a cousinly one that it has done me much good. Nathan had one from Raymond too- he goes to Marietta 2nd of this month."}],"title":"Nathan Kendall and Abby J. Reed Kendall letters, 1842-1907"}}}

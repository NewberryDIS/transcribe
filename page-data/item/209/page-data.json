Lizzy came for me to go with her to the Post office, was the first I knew of her writing.  I hope Ellen will answer her letter, I was in the Cemetery this morning at the funeral of Dr. Stevenson, I saw Miss Sarah at her Piano as I passed the window, Lizzy & I still talk about Washington and the pleasure we had all through you and your family.

I wont offend again by saying you only like me & write to me on Jule's account.  I wont indeed, I do it thoughtlessly.

I did not see one, good luck, wasn't it. 3 o'clock, Just before dinner I had a visit from Lizzy who gave me all the nes.

Will would have been so glad to have had a talk with him and Lizzy too. I dont speak for  myself as I was away. but both Liz & I took quite a fancy to him. Dont dream such horrible things about me any more, for if you dream I am to married it is a sign I shall die and vice versa.  I am not ready for either by any means, about as much in the humor for one as the other.  To day I insisted upon having diner on the back porch, which is covered with vines, and just as we sat down, bless us, but it did storm, the rain came pelting in.

My Darling Tom Blair has returned, I went to see him yesterday evening, and today am quite posted up in Paris & London, He admires the French extraovgantly, and says there is nothing like the vice in France, that there is in England, but we only got a talk of two hours, and that is just a beginning. you may imagine I spent a very pleasant evening. Well upon my word of pages, dont be frightened, I promise not to do it again if you dont like it; but I feel like writing for an hour yet; I shand do ti though for I must go to see Mrs. Olden and take this to the Post Office. I am glad you feel a little homesick for \"the dignified fashionable Miss Anderson\" bless me! how I laughed at that; when will you come again, to help us?

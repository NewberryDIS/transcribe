Lizzy came for me to go with her to the Post office, was the first I knew of her writing.  I hope Ellen will answer her letter, I was in the Cemetery this morning at the funeral of Dr. Stevenson, I saw Miss Sarah at her Piano as I passed the window, Lizzy & I still talk about Washington and the pleasure we had all through you and your family.

I wont offend again by saying you only like me & write to me on Jule's account.  I wont indeed, I do it thoughtlessly.

I did not see one, good luck, wasn't it. 3 o'clock, Just before dinner I had a visit from Lizzy who gave me all the nes.

Will would have been so glad to have had a talk with him and Lizzy too. I dont speak for  myself as I was away. but both Liz & I took quite a fancy to him. Dont dream such horrible things about me any more, for if you dream I am to married it is a sign I shall die and vice versa.  I am not ready for either by any means, about as much in the humor for one as the other.  To day I insisted upon having diner on the back porch, which is covered with vines, and just as we sat down, bless us, but it did storm, the rain came pelting in.

Did you know there was to be a young lady cousin brought home amongst other valuable merchandize, well! there is, and I am not one bit glad, are you? I fear our strolls up 4th St. about 2 1/2 o'C. will be sadly interfered with, by the cousin, perhaps she could be induced to sprain her ankle. My Darling Tom Blair has returned, I went to see him yesterday evening, and today am quite posted up in Paris & London, He admires the French extraovgantly, and says there is nothing like the vice in France, that there is in England, but we only got a talk of two hours, and that is just a beginning. you may imagine I spent a very pleasant evening. Well upon my word of pages, dont be frightened, I promise not to do it again if you dont like it; but I feel like writing for an hour yet; I shand do ti though for I must go to see Mrs. Olden and take this to the Post Office. I am glad you feel a little homesick for \"the dignified fashionable Miss Anderson\" bless me! how I laughed at that; when will you come again, to help us? If I go to Fayette on Saturday I'll let you know. The weather is so cool and delightful now but on Saturday at 6 o'c, the Thermometer was degree symbol 94"},{"pageid":47160,"pagefilename":"8236d93d296898a96ff526c1d69c52bf.jpg","transcription":"written sideways on left side of envelope\nMary Anderson\n1851\nMr. John V.

I agreed, and our trunks left down stairs, in readiness, Father and Mother proposed joining the party and here we are, except the old lady & gentleman who returned in the 2 o'clock train.

On the unclear man subject I cannot be touched, as he has pestered me into the dislike I have taken towards him, but the coffee, I grant you. I did take a cup the evening I took sick but have not touched it since. I should be very well if I could get rid of this cold, which I took through not fault of my own, as at Fayette they put one to sleep in damp sheets, enough to kill a strong man, to say nothing of a sick mortal like myself.

I begin to think you know me pretty well, I was in one of my nervous humors when I wrote the last long letter.

She & Annie escaped to go to Washington in September. where you will see them, I felt quite disappointed when you wrote that you would not return until November, but I suppose it is best for you, and you can pay Pitts several visits between now and then.

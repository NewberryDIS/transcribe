Mr. Marshall was quite concerned when I told him you would not return until autumn, but smiled very significantly, and said, \"Oh! he cant stay away that long I know\", I only laughed and said perhaps not, innocent youth! he evidently thinks we are very devoted and our Julie entirely forgotten, I wonder if he forgets the time, he informed you the music would be improved if you would take a different look.

I was almost certain she would come, or at least send a letter, but not one word, I know nothing more than when I saw you, except that she is still at West River, and will meet Alex in Annapolis in about two weeks. they will then go to different watering places, and return about the first of September.

How you must have enjoyed your first hunt.  I only wish I could accept your invitation and go with you next time, though it should be in the humble situation of cook. I'll take that ride, through those pleasant  woods. Have you had another Pic Nic? We had such a pleasant afternoon only this day week too, why it seems an age since then, you must not shock your Grandmother by playing on Sunday, but go to church or write to me, all the same thing.  I thank you for your kindness in wishing I had your flowers, some one, I shant say who sent me a beautiful bouquet this morning which I am at present enjoying extravagantly.

I feel as though I should hear more of it. Oh! I beseech you do not be drawn into another if you can possibly avoid it.  How does Miss Chislett enjoy herself?  Lizzy came for me to go with her to the Post office, was the first I knew of her writing.  I hope Ellen will answer her letter, I was in the Cemetery this morning at the funeral of Dr. Stevenson, I saw Miss Sarah at her Piano as I passed the window, Lizzy & I still talk about Washington and the pleasure we had all through you and your family.

I have had a fine time for the last two weeks riding on horse back by moonlight looking for ghosts, which of course you know I believe in, any quantity of nice Pic Nics, sociable ones like ours at Washington romantic walks, reading interesting books, in the woods, and on Fourth of July, we had fireworks of every description which I could have dispensed with, as I am not particularly attached to that style of amusement, but now all is over, and I shall roast here for at least three or four weeks as Father started this morning for Cape May, and my sister on Monday , for Fayette, Mother and I will be alone, A.

Lizzie Shaler staid all night with me the night before I went to Deer Creek, and I have not seen her since, she does not know I am at home. I changed my mind about your message, to her, I delivered it; and read her a few sentences of your letter, as I came to the sage conclusion that it did not make any difference whether she understood why we corresponded or not, but she has good sense when she chooses to use it.  So all's well, Your charming friend Frederick I met the evening before I went to D. C. and he informed me that he started to pay me a visit a few evenings before, but for some reason, did not reach the desired goal, my first impulse was to groan, but I was afraid he would think I took fits like his sister and rush to my rescue, so I controlled myself, and said \"Ah! that was unfortunate,\" and upon the instant informed him that I would be out of town for two weeks.

I took a hearty laugh over your description of Jacks arrival, but I thought you would bring Ellen home and I should see you, But dont come until you cannot help it for I assure you the heat is intolerable and you would wish yourself back again as soon as we had our talk out. I wont offend again by saying you only like me & write to me on Jule's account.  I wont indeed, I do it thoughtlessly.  I am so glad to hear there is no prospect of another fight: fro I assure you i was very uneasy, I have scarcely a hope that you can read my writing for I am so careless about it.; I was quite shocked to hear that Curf? had returned to his old ways , for though I feel but little interest in him I am always sorry to hear of any young man drinking.  I have not been to the Choir since I wrote, and do not know whether Mr Marshall has left or not, but Mrs Murray's throat is better and I presume she will continue to sing of course I shall go on Saturday night, but I promise you Curf? shant take me home and there will be only two drinks of mineral water, Lizzy and your humble servant. So you are in love with Kate very well, just send me an invitation to the wedding.  I am sorry you are disappointed in your musical arrangements for the summer, as for the mountain it is no matter you might have ben bitten by a  snake.  I did not see one, good luck, wasn't it. 3 o'clock, Just before dinner I had a visit from Lizzy who gave me all the news. Mr Marshall has gone and he has invited Ginnie Ormsby into the choir to sing second, of course A. E. will go down stairs as if she is willing. I will use all my influence to prevent her singing with Ginnie, who might possible strike by chance one true note in a day, but she is not to come up until Mr Marshall returns and as she is to marry Dr Morgan, she'll soon drop off. so after all it's no matter, Your Sally is much better, Lizzy says she is getting well, Henry Israel says you are to be here on Saturday evening, I wish I knew whether it was true.  if I though it I would not send this letter, but keep every thing to tell you, I want to try and answer all your questions.  I did not ask Till? who told her, but I presume Mrs B.

I wish I had the Message Bird. I shall miss it very much next Sunday for whilst I was in the country I had everything to  amuse me. One Sunday we had a sort of Pic Nic whilst the good ones were at church but the next one I took myself up and read my Prayer Book.  Why did'nt the little Dr go to see any body whilst he was in town. Will would have been so glad to have had a talk with him and Lizzy too. I dont speak for  myself as I was away. but both Liz & I took quite a fancy to him. Dont dream such horrible things about me any more, for if you dream I am to married it is a sign I shall die and vice versa.  I am not ready for either by any means, about as much in the humor for one as the other.  To day I insisted upon having dinner on the back porch, which is covered with vines, and just as we sat down, bless us, but it did storm, the rain came pelting in.  I insisted upon remaining? the rainy place and ate away.  I thought Will would have killed himself laughing at my  unclear table That's what I get for being romantic and wishing to eat in an arbor.  To morrow there is to be a grand Pic Nic, to which I believe the whole of Allegheny county is invited.  I have said NO!  I thank you, I quite envy you, your flowers, many thanks for thinking of me, when you enjoy them so much yourself.  I wrote this morning to Jule? before I got your letter.  As I have a letter to my sister to accomplish before tea time , I must stop for the present.  Oh!  I am almost melted.

When I told them in the choir what I had done, they were quite offended, but I told Annie if she had come to rehearsal it would have been different, so we sang the Psalm and Hymn, but oh! the evening,!!! there was glory, there was fame!!!! Mr Paull, induced Mr Fleming to come, and Cauf? insisted upon singing the chants, Annie seemed to wish it, and I gave in, to my sorrow, for such a time, you never saw.

I laughed at the idea, said I supposed Jule wanted a trip, I was perfectly astonished for I did not know any one, but Cauf? suspected there was any reason for Jules going away, and I set that down to the quick eyes of love, which could penetrate the walls of the Tower of London, Sarah's questions were very innocently asked and because she took an interest in you, but she little thought how near she came to the truth.

Dr. N. seems to think that rather high - but - he says there is no one else there who can attend to such things - though if you had been in Gallipolis you could have obtained all the testimony required - However the loss of time & the expenses would have amounted to nearly that - and after all forty dollars is not a very high price for 160 acres of land.

I don't believe there are a dozen families in town where they have not been moving their tables round?. Do you know what the experiment is? Four or five persons seat themselves round a table - each one laying their left hand on the table - and their right upon their neighbor's left - thus forming a complete circle or chain - And after sitting thus for twenty or thirty minutes the table begins to move around the room - without any impulse from any person - and the more lightly the hands rest on the table - the more rapidly it moves. And sometimes when there is a good circle it will continue to move after all the hands are raised except one or two pairs - if those raised remain clasped - It is a singular phenomenon - and no one seems to be able to account for it.

It generally moves in a circle when nothing opposes its progress - but if a second circle be formed outside the first - by resting the hands on the shoulders of the first circle - it moves in an opposite direction.

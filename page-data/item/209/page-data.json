Lizzy came for me to go with her to the Post office, was the first I knew of her writing.  I hope Ellen will answer her letter, I was in the Cemetery this morning at the funeral of Dr. Stevenson, I saw Miss Sarah at her Piano as I passed the window, Lizzy & I still talk about Washington and the pleasure we had all through you and your family.

I wont offend again by saying you only like me & write to me on Jule's account.  I wont indeed, I do it thoughtlessly.

I did not see one, good luck, wasn't it. 3 o'clock, Just before dinner I had a visit from Lizzy who gave me all the nes.

Will would have been so glad to have had a talk with him and Lizzy too. I dont speak for  myself as I was away. but both Liz & I took quite a fancy to him. Dont dream such horrible things about me any more, for if you dream I am to married it is a sign I shall die and vice versa.  I am not ready for either by any means, about as much in the humor for one as the other.  To day I insisted upon having diner on the back porch, which is covered with vines, and just as we sat down, bless us, but it did storm, the rain came pelting in.

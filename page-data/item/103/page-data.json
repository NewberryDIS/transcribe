S. W. WHITNEY, A. M., Principal. This institution is located in the village of Bound Brook, N. J., twenty-two miles west of Elizabeth, on the Central Rail Road running from Elizabethport to Easton, Penn. It is also on the Raritan river, six miles north west of New Brunswick. The school was organized about seventeen months ago as an institution for the education of children of both sexes; and the Board of Trustees are happy to state that they believe both the general tone of manners and the standard of scholarship attained in such a school, in consequence of the mutual influence of the two sexes on each other as they are daily brought together in the school and recitation rooms under the eye of their teachers, to be higher than is possible of being attained, other things being equal, in schools composed wholly of boys or wholly of girls. As both sexes are found in families, nature teaches that should be permitted to pursue their education together, instead of being isolated from each other, and left in their isolation to form habits unnatural if not unfavorable to their success or usefulness in after life. The school especially commends itself to those who have both sons and daughters to be educated, their children having here the opportunity of pursuing their studies without being separated from each other as they must be if sent to schools of the ordinary character. The number of boarders, however, is limited to twenty; and an early application is recommended to those who would secure a place for their children. The Seminary building to which the school will be removed on the 1st of January next, is new, having been erected the past Summer expressly for the accommodation of the school. The house in all its arrangements for the use of the scholars is double. The boys and girls have no communication with each other, and are not brought together except under the eye of their teachers in the school-room, at meals, during recitations, or in their social intercourse with the family of the Principal. The building has been constructed with at view to the comfort and health of all its inmates. Its location is elevated, airy and healthy-few, if any, more so. The grounds are ample, affording to both boys and girls airy yards of their own, entirely apart from each other. The government is parental-mild but firm. While every means is employed to draw out and strengthen the minds of the pupils, and lead them, if possible, to independent thinking and self-reliance, no less attention is paid to their manners and the formation of characters proceeding upon high-minded, virtuous principles. Every evidence of a desire faithfully to discharge duty is sought, duly appreciated, and correspondingly noticed. Those, however, who are known to exert an immoral or vicious influence will not be tolerated as members of the school. They must expect to be sent home. The academical year commences the first MONDAY in September and consists of two sessions of 22 weeks each. The vacations are three; the week between Christmas and New Year's, the week commencing with the first Monday in May, and the six weeks from the close of the second session till the first Monday in September. Public examinations and exhibitions are held annually at the close of the Summer session. The following schedule of terms has been adopted by the Board to go into effect on and after the 17th of the present months. TERMS FOR BOARDING PER SESSION OF 22 WEEK: Board, washing, fuel, lights, bedding, and tuition in English branches and Classics, payable quarterly in advance, $100 00 TERMS FOR DAY SCHOLARS PER QUARTER OF 11 WEEKS: Primary Class, 5 00 Common English Branches, 7 50 Higher English Branches and Classics, 10 00 EXTRA CHARGES PER QUARTER: French and German, each, 2 50 Music on Piano, 7 50 Drawing, Monochromaties, Painting in water colors, each, 2 50 Oil Painting, 7 50 N. B.-No deduction from these rates for absence during the quarter except in cases of sickness protracted beyond two weeks. For the information of friends of the school in New York and vicinity, it may be necessary to add that the most direct route from New York is by way of the Central Rail Road line of New Jersey, leaving Pier No. 2, North River, four times daily by Steamboat Red Jacket or Wyoming.

Of course that made us so late that we could not get to K.C. in time to play the game so we came back to Des Moines and called the game off. We are now trying to get a game with the for next week. We play the State Normal school day after tomorrow. I am glad you saw the Northwestern-Chicago game on October 18 and I wish I could have been there to go to the game with you. I thought N.U. would get beaten more than 12 points. Did'nt you? You know they lost nearly all of there old team. However I think they put up a good game, it is very hard for a team to win every time.

The folks were gone nearly two weeks and I was just beginning to think I was a fine house keeper when mother came home and began to talk about how dirty everything was.\nThey spent two or three days with George went to Washington and Pittsburg and had a fine trip.\nSay do you know it is'nt very long before the fishing will be good at Okoboji?

Mother is already planning for the Lake next summer, and I think I will be allowed to go up early enough to get the house painted before the others get there. Of course I consider this no small honor, but I would be kind enough to share it with some-one else. I am getting along fine with my school, and I won the debate last week in a walk.

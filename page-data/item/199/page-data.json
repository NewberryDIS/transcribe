Thirty-eight years, or a little over half of my life was spent in that state. I lived at times in the country, in the small and larger villages and in the cities, and thus had an opportunity of studying the working of prohibition under all conditions.\nSecondly I am a total abstainer and have been all my life. So the rigid enforcement of the law would in no way effect my personal habits.\nThirdly I thoroughly believe the consumption of alcohol, even if in moderation, is injurious or at least wholly unnecessary word completed on next page"},{"pageid":45147,"pagefilename":"102b5a27b9116849993929912419736d.jpg","transcription":"2\nunnecessary.

I am not underlined in favor of prohibition.\nI will briefly give a few reasons for my belief.\nMy first underlined objection to prohibition is a fundamental one. If we define the primary function of government to be that of protecting each individual against all others, then all other State action comes under the deffinition of protecting each individual against himself - against his own stupidity his own rashness, or other defects that prevent"},{"pageid":45148,"pagefilename":"2e82681327750d9f2edbe6ee25441423.jpg","transcription":"IMAGE F..O.

Now prohibition comes under this latter class of laws and is a strictly sumptuary law.\nIt may be argued that this is a purely academic objection. But I am confident it is not. On the other hand a disregard of the legitimate sphere of government is the source of most of the unwise legislation that is leading to too much government, excessive taxation, and a growing disrespect for law. And this I regard as America's greatest danger today.\nMy second underlined objection to the law is it has never been enforced and I question if it ever can be enforced, at least not for many, many years to come. It was not enforced in Maine, it was not enforced in Kansas, or any other state where tried. But it is argued the strong arm of the government will succeed where the states have failed. But what evidence have we for thinking the Federal government will succeed any better than the states have succeeded? Why does not the strong arm of the government enforce the 14th article\nover"},{"pageid":45149,"pagefilename":"c206149950efc321d449422edb0aeb03.jpg","transcription":"4\n\nof the Constitution giving the Negro the right to vote. Negro suffrage in the south is a joke.\nNow the most optomistic supporter of prohibition frankly admits it is not enforced today, but is confidint it will be enforced later. But is there anything to warrant such a conclusion. More than one half the adult population of the U.S. if left unrestrained would consume alcohol to some extent, hence do not want the law enforced. Only a small portion of the other half are willing to take any active part in enforcement, most men are to much absorbed in their own affairs to spend any time or thought in the enforcement of a law that does not effect themselves directly. So we have the sad spectacl of a law flagrantly, and many times openly violated. What could be more destructive to good government.\nI think we can safely conclude that so long as the appetite exhists and the supply of grapes and sugar and yeast cake hold out, and every kitchen a brewery, Dame Nature will turn these ingredients into very good wine. And if anyone wants a stronger kick the omnipresent bootleger with his ways that are dark and tricks that are vain can supply him."}],"title":"Clarence Darrow letters to John T. Jacobs, 1909-1926"}}}

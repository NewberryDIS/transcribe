Jan. 6, 1908.\nDear Doctor:\nI was delighted to receive your letter to-day. Have expected each day to hear from you so the letter seemed a long time coming.\nHave been confined to my bed since the 31st of December with a cold that had settled in my intestines. I contracted it on the train from New Orleans to Los Angeles. It first settled in my head; then it traveled down to my chest and the last and what I hope is the final break-out"},{"pageid":63369,"pagefilename":"129cf1d961fb936099f52714de46d58b.jpg","transcription":"THIS HOTEL IS ABSOLUTELY FIRE PROOF\nH.C.

I was out again yesterday for the first time and again to-day, so you can judge for yourself that I must be on the mend.\nYour advice on tobacco smoking and also about meals I consider excellent. Am tafering off on my smojing and now I eat but two meals a day. I am not sure that I should give up smoking entirely but I am gradually drifting into moderation which is a good beginning, you will say. I am under a physician's care here who seems to have the"},{"pageid":63370,"pagefilename":"5b9797795b57d6e9f1cc10e84832bd7c.jpg","transcription":"THIS HOTEL IS ABSOLUTELY FIRE PROOF\nH.C. FRYMAN.

My general condition, of course, has not been improved by this severe attack of dysentry but now that I am recovering from that I expect to improve in my general health. Open air and exercise should do the trick.\nYes, I am usually prompt in replying to your letters as I am with all friends that I value. But I was in such a rein-down condition for several months in New York that I neglected everyone. It seemed impossible"},{"pageid":63371,"pagefilename":"63acfaa92f0831a41c998c6000e4dabd.jpg","transcription":"THIS HOTEL IS ABSOLUTELY FIRE PROOF\nH.C. FRYMAN.

I recall very well your mentioning her to me.\nYour news of Major Mereer is truly news to me for I had not heard of it. I am very much gratified at hearing it. You may count on my doing my outmost to re-instate Yenil Pratto when I am feeling more like my old self- I don't mean entirely well for that will take some little time- but"},{"pageid":63372,"pagefilename":"e7b5e54fcd351bf9dafc77275b9ae18d.jpg","transcription":"THIS HOTEL IS ABSOLUTELY FIRE PROOF\nH.C.

You know, perhaps, that I have written articles on other subjects for The Outlook but always at their request and upon their order. But I know the editor-in-chief so well that I shall not hesitate to send it on to him. Will tell him that if he does not wish to run it as a regular article he can do so then as an open-letter with my consent.

I shall probably write the article this week and get it into the editor's hands the latter part of next week. You can count on my being forcible but tempered with tactfulness so that the charge will not miss fire. I want it to be useful and hence of course it must not be virulent.\nDo let me have your articles whenever you can. I am glad to learn that you are getting in some good shots. \nDo you ever see our good friends, the Burgess family?"},{"pageid":63374,"pagefilename":"d367aa415ab90f0a256ec1c2a91857bd.jpg","transcription":"THIS HOTEL IS ABSOLUTELY FIRE PROOF\nH.C.

With Yenil Pratt back in Carlisle, Miss Burgess must then be prevailed upon- well I am going on too fast; we must first get Yenil Pratt back.\nIf I can be of use by communicating with the California senators or congressmen why just say so.

I am very glad on your account as well as any own that the answer was favorable or I could not have forgiven myself for neglecting to write so long. I wish very much you could spend next term at home with me, I think we could make home quite comfortable and be well prepared ourselves befor we go next year. South Hadley is no place to do any thing more than keep our clothes in order besides our other duties. I know that you will lose some time by being home, and that you would have to let your french and drawing drop for the present, but I think you and I could find some time every day to read latin. I do not wish to urge you to do any thing that would not be well for you and therefore only mention this and hope you will act your own pleasure. I should like to read Virgil again and think I shall set apart a particular hour each day for that purpose (even if you do not come home), so that I shall be prepared for examination as soon as I go there. I shall try to analyze some flowers during the summer so as not to have quite so much to do next year, if you analyze any be sure to keep the names for it will help you.\nI hope to see you soon and then we can talk over things much better than write them. Sarah is not quite so well as she has been, she has a fever every day. We are expecting Mother home tonight, It seems a long time since she left. We have got along very well but are lonely without her. It is quite unpleasant today and we some fear ma may not be able to come. We are haveing a fine time today as we have very little do. We had fried pork and boiled potatoes to dinner dont you wish you had been here. When I was cooking the pork the fat spattered up on my face and burned it a little in several spots. I tell you this in hopes of having some sympathy from you for Mary says that I make so much fuss when only burned a little that she never knows when to pity me. Did you ever hear such a thing? just as though my face did not hurt any, well I should like to see her feelings just to know if she had any."},{"pageid":24845,"pagefilename":"f8cbdf2cf57bb1d758dabf61dd432707.jpg","transcription":"Sarah says that she is not worse only she has a little cold just now which causes her side to ache.

Hadley tuesday night and hasten to inform you that we have been accepted. I am very glad on your account as well as any own that the answer was favorable or I could not have forgiven myself for neglecting to write so long. I wish very much you could spend next term at home with me, I think we could make home quite comfortable and be well prepared ourselves befor we go next year. South Hadley is no place to do any thing more than keep our clothes in order besides our other duties. I know that you will lose some time by being home, and that you would have to let your french and drawing drop for the present, but I think you and I could find some time every day to read latin. I do not wish to urge you to do any thing that would not be well for you and therefore only mention this and hope you will act your own pleasure. I should like to read Virgil again and think I shall set apart a particular hour each day for that purpose (even if you do not come home), so that I shall be prepared for examination as soon as I go there. I shall try to analyze some flowers during the summer so as not to have quite so much to do next year, if you analyze any be sure to keep the names for it will help you.\nI hope to see you soon and then we can talk over things much better than write them. Sarah is not quite so well as she has been, she has a fever every day. We are expecting Mother home tonight, It seems a long time since she left. We have got along very well but are lonely without her. It is quite unpleasant today and we some fear ma may not be able to come. We are haveing a fine time today as we have very little do. We had fried pork and boiled potatoes to dinner dont you wish you had been here. When I was cooking the pork the fat spattered up on my face and burned it a little in several spots. I tell you this in hopes of having some sympathy from you for Mary says that I make so much fuss when only burned a little that she never knows when to pity me. Did you ever hear such a thing? just as though my face did not hurt any, well I should like to see her feelings just to know if she had any."},{"pageid":24845,"pagefilename":"f8cbdf2cf57bb1d758dabf61dd432707.jpg","transcription":"Sarah says that she is not worse only she has a little cold just now which causes her side to ache.

Fillmore says We will have fine times all of us together I assure you and perhaps we can coax Mary to cut up some shine then, wouldnt that be fun. Mary says if we are a going to feel bad we had better be about it before then, I think so too, dont you?

Forgive me if I have again seemed to neglect you, it was not my intention so to do, but cousins make one so happy that the time passes wonderfully fast. Last Saturday Thomas took us to Central Park, New York. We took the 6th Av. cars at the City Hall, New York and had a ride of six or eight mile before we came to the park. On our way we past the park where is Lowe's great air ship in which he proposes to go to Europe, but we could see nothing of it as there is a very high fence all around. Of course, you know from the papers that Prof. Lowe's departure is indefinitely postponed on account of the illness of his marine navigator. It would be impossible to give you any idea of the grandness of Central Park. Imagine 844 acres thrown into one great inclosure and laid out with beautiful walks, shady groves, cool lakes and streams. The work of forming and beautifying it is not yet half done and we had only an hour to be there, so that of what there is, we could get but a bird's eye view yet was my heart filled with wonder and admiration at the proofs of the power of man's genius. The rocks had he made to \"blossom like the rose\" for upon their flinty bosoms he laid the soft tender soil and there planted trees and other shrubbery.

It was so low that the upper part was only a little higher than the surrounding land, -- the water in the pond will not, I think, be very deep, from the masonry at the sides I should judge not more than four feet at the greatest. The Croton Reservoir is within the park. It was not covered and was the only water we saw there as the lakes, ponds &c. are not yet sufficiently advanced to receive water. When this park is finished, it will be one of the most stupendous works of art combined with nature and one of the most lovely adornings the city could possibly possess. There is to be a highway through the park, leading from the 5th to the 8th Av. the sides of which are to be of masonry. It will be quite below the surface of the park and will be crossed by stone or iron bridges. There are to be roads for walking, others for carriages, and still others for horseback rides. We saw several gentlemen and two ladies on their horses lightly skimming over even surface prepared for them upon the once rugged bolders.

I am so sorry I have neglected my journal for two or three years. I have lost the best part of our lives and I regret it, as it was so full of events that belong to the young ladies, for they have lived a very gay life and received much attention. Invitations have been numerous for them to ride on horseback, concerts, parties, Opera,s Croquet parties, Sleigh rides and all kinds of gaieties, they have had many charming Beaus, and we have travelled a great deal. We visit every winter our Louisville home. They always give us a large party. We visited Lake Geneva in Wis. enjoyed a few weeks there. Mattie Faulds and Octave with us. The boats and fishing my little boys enjoyed. The lake is very pretty and clear it is nine miles round. The drives down and up on the hills is beautiful. Everywhere you turn you see the lake, many people have summer homes there. We have visited Waukegan, Lake Superior, Marquette, Green Bay, Escanaba, Riverside which is 12 miles from Chicago we spent some time at. We took a Cottage and stayed there while our house was being finished. Many young Gentlemen came out on account of my daughters being there, they had picnics, rowing, fishing and balls, so it was very attractive.

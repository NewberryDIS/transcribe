The next day Mrs. Kimball sent the remains of the feast to the poor of the town and neighborhood. Major Kimball is a good man.  I do not suppose a more strictly honest man exists.  His character is in such striking contrast to that of the other quartermasters big and little that I have fallen in with in my short army experience that I cannot avoid remarking upon it - How much good it would do some who are puffed up with authority to take lessons from him.

It is rather remarkable that Capt. Byrne should feel compelled to defend not only  himself but all the officers of the garrison before any have been accused.  In the opinion of the commanding officer, the captain's singular burst of virtuous indignation, although apparently on account of Par I G.O No. 2, from these Hd.Qrs. has in reality been caused by private quarrels he had had with officers of the Regiment before his arrival at this station.\n(Signed) B.H.

She went home from Richardson, and before she left there was a dirty piece of scandal about she and that doctor who came up to Gibson with Lawson's command in the summer of '72.

I may not have much sympathy on Nordstrom on general principles, but he is at present about the worst subject of tyrannical persecution that I ever saw. \nBecks's resignation has been accepted by the war dept., but not to date Dec. 31st, as he tendered it, but Dec. 8th, the date he left on recruiting service.

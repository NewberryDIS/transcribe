I gladly accepted his offer thinking you would be pleased to see any one who had seen me here.\nYesterday and to day have been cold and stormy and consequently I have not stirred from the house I am now sitting close to a comfortable, cheerful fire of wood in my own room. Every thing is quiet, my room mate, young Dr Bronsow having gone out to Church, and I am as cosy and comfortable as I can expect to be away from you.\nI have not been here long enough to form any just estimate of the effect the climate is going to have upon me. Yet I must say that I feel encouraged. The excrutiating pains in my chest, side, shoulders &c which I had before leaving home and which I had so severely on board ship have entirely. My expectoration and coughing are much less- and I can lay a good deal on the right side, which you may recollect I could scarcely do before leaving home. Tomorrow if the weather will permit I will weigh myself and see whether I have gained or lost since I landed.

And it has relieved me from much anxiety, for I take it for granted that you are all well altho you do not say so in precise terms. I am much pleased to hear that Ben is gaining. It would be a great pleasure if I could have him here with me. Sweet little Fanny, how \" Papa would like to kiss  that \" sweet spot. Does she improve in her walking. Let Tilly sleep in the small bed room, at any rate not in a room with a fire -- I wish you were not oblidged to: my mind is more deeply impressed? than ever with the necesity of sleeping in well ventilated apartments. I hope you will dispense with a fire in your sleeping apartment, as soon as you can. On many accounts I should like to change my boarding house, but am afraid that I cannot find as good a sleeping apartment -- as my present one is large, & airy with three windows and a large fireplace. \n    This will be the third Wednesday that I have mailed a letter to you. Yesterday the \"Southport\" set sail for New York - and Mr. Smith the first mate kindly takes charge of a letter for you; he will take it to the house so you can see him yourself, and question him as to my appearance. He will also call again before returning to Savannah for any letter or package you may wish to send to me.

During the fine weather, I can almost feel myself improve, but the rainy, windy days are almost as bad for me as the stormy days at the North. There are many who have recovered health here, but it is always by staying here through the summer. Mr. Olmstead the Cashier came here some 15 years since and told me that he cured himself by keeping in the house during the winter and remaining through the summer. However I hope to derive benefit even during the winter - and if I had you here to look round for ? very soon, so that if it should please God that I should be spared for a time, I may be able to stay here next winter and have you with me. I feel that I cannot live in the north. \n    In my second letter I told you of the death of Mr. Neufville -- Last Friday I called on the \"Rev. Rufus W? White\" and presented Mr. Stones letter to him. He said that he had heard of me, and the Mrs. Neufville desired him to find me, but he had not been able to, not having the slightest Clue, either my name, boarding house, or anything else.

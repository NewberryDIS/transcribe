Other visitors have done so, and should not I? Other writers have had their journals published and given to the world, but I do not aspire to this. I do not want mine to go outside of me home circle. I shall write just as the thoughts occur; but I wish I could write them down as easily as they come. This is a beginning- not very extensive. I know - but it answers my purpose."},{"pageid":79232,"pagefilename":"79f8ff14ed008be3f956ecc18d881d97.jpg","transcription":"Yesterday, I began to copy for my new book. I do not know how I over come to think of setting to work at another; for with all my other writings it seems a great undertaking. But something seems to whisper - \"Go on.\" I may finish it, I may not - God knows. If not; I shall leave it in such a manner, that sister Della, at her leisure and inclination can readily resume where my pen is laid aside. And I hope the dear girl will do this. I call my book - \"Wayside Blossom.\" I give it this title because its contents in prose and poetry have been written from time to time, allowing many a long and chequered year. This pieces reminded me of wild flowers - buttercups and daisies simple and lonely in their pretentions; and which one sees along the country wayside, when one, freelance, has left the busy town and is going home."},{"pageid":79233,"pagefilename":"3e4d7ec3f9edd9a83b3a08f9681e1d15.jpg","transcription":"Thursday Nov 11- '76\nI have quite an item to note down to-night A\nlong resident of our native village at the East\nsend indirectly for a copy of \"Silver Ripples\"\nThis makes two which to my knowledge have \ngone there.

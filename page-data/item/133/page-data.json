Having found, however, that club-women in general are interested in our new magazine, (many inquiries concerning the subscription price, etc. having been received), we now wish to direct the attention of all club women to PUTNAM'S and to offer a very attractive premium.\nWe feel that the interest which PUTNAM'S has created in the intellectually alert and cultivated circles of women's clubs is one of the highest compliments that has been paid to the magazine. Because it is a new periodical which follows the literary and artistic movements of the time, and attends also to the progress of affairs the world over, and because it presents matters in attractive and finished literary form, we feel sure of its appeal to America club-women, and wish to enlist for it their interest and approval.\nYou should, by this time, have the specimen copy of the magazine, and we are confident it will plead its own cause well. If you are an earnest club-worker you will find that the well written and well balanced articles on the large interests of the day, as well as the book reviews and other features, will be of great service to you in the preparation of papers, and in other ways."},{"pageid":31578,"pagefilename":"5d37c668aaf6d189d0ff1c21de70a83c.jpg","transcription":"(2)\nThere is also in the essays and the fiction much to amuse and instruct, and whether you use it for the specific purposes indicated above or not you may rest assured that it will carry to you each month a breath of fresh and charming literature--the work of some of the brightest minds and most graceful pens of the day.\nDesirous of making its first appearance in your home as graciously as possible, PUTNAM'S MONTHLY will bring with it, if it receives an invitation from you, as gift for your acceptance--any one of the popular novels of the day which may be selected. We shall be glad to send you the novel of your choice, and with it the magazine for a year, if you will write the title of the story you select on the last page of the circular and send it to us with $3., the cost of a year's subscription to PUTNAM'S MONTHLY.\nTrusting that the advantageous suggestion we are making may excuse us for trespassing upon your time, we are,\nYours truly,\nPUTNAM'S MONTHLY.\nIf you are not already a subscriber to THE BOOKMAN, we can offer you both PUTNAM'S and THE BOOKMAN at the special price of $3.50.

But his crowning day will come by and by, and those who opposed or failed to sustain him in this life will then learn their great error or the unpardonable sin they have committed.\nHow hard it must be for you and others to continue there where, notwithstanding the great abundance of the true light of the gospel given the people so freely in the past, so much of error and wrong have been enacted for so long a time. May God have mercy on the people of Remsen.\nWell, we are still in the Sunny South where as to climate and God's abundant provisions one could not ask for more. These things alone are enough to debar one from the thought of returning to the north to live again. In the near future I believe great prosperity will prevail in many parts of the South. Where the colored people are so numerous, are sections not so attractive to the white men.

The daily use of the universal Japanese bath is most beneficially shown in its prevention and control of the consequences of excesses upon the Kidneys, in Uromeia and acute or chronic Bright's Disease.\nYour opinion is particularly desired on its applicability to your specialty, and such modification as you may suggest will be thankfully accepted. Your opinions will not be published except with your permission.\nHoping that you will lend your valuable assistance towards disseminating in the Profession a knowledge of the practicability of this apparatus, I remain,\nYours very truly,\nAlbert D?

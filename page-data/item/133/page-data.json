Because it is a new periodical which follows the literary and artistic movements of the time, and attends also to the progress of affairs the world over, and because it presents matters in attractive and finished literary form, we feel sure of its appeal to America club-women, and wish to enlist for it their interest and approval.\nYou should, by this time, have the specimen copy of the magazine, and we are confident it will plead its own cause well.

But some things that have come to pass could have been very different in their final results, were the hearts of some men more inclined to the ways of the Lord than they have been. Especially so, it seems to me, might things have been in Reemsen.\nIn reading your letter it saddened our hearts to recall events well known to us - the expectation of being able to do some good in our own humble way, and the whole thing being blasted because the will of one man of the world was not regarded, and that in our childhood home.\nIt was sad indeed to read how, after years of toil and faithful labor in the vineyard of the Lord, Mr Davies, broken in body and disappointed in heart, was, because really of stretghtened? circumstances, compelled to turn his back on the people he had longed to serve had he been permitted to do so according to God's word.

But his crowning day will come by and by, and those who opposed or failed to sustain him in this life will then learn their great error or the unpardonable sin they have committed.\nHow hard it must be for you and others to continue there where, notwithstanding the great abundance of the true light of the gospel given the people so freely in the past, so much of error and wrong have been enacted for so long a time. May God have mercy on the people of Remsen.\nWell, we are still in the Sunny South where as to climate and God's abundant provisions one could not ask for more. These things alone are enough to debar one from the thought of returning to the north to live again. In the near future I believe great prosperity will prevail in many parts of the South. Where the colored people are so numerous, are sections not so attractive to the white men.

A very few of them have, at any time, assented to my statements as true.\nOn Saturday, casually meeting two of our best known and most influential citizens at a lawyer's office they, speaking of our present war with Spain, said without any conversation that would lead to it: \"We now see very clearly and as never before that the overthrow of the Confederate forces was a great blessing and that the United States, if not already so regarded, will soon be acknowledged the greatest military and moral force in the world.\"\nThis was saying much for two who in the past had been bitter secessionist.

The daily use of the universal Japanese bath is most beneficially shown in its prevention and control of the consequences of excesses upon the Kidneys, in Uromeia and acute or chronic Bright's Disease.\nYour opinion is particularly desired on its applicability to your specialty, and such modification as you may suggest will be thankfully accepted.

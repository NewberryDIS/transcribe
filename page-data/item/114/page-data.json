Howard had met an earlier train but before we reached the main part on a street car, he somehow saw us on the car and so we came together. We ate dinner with him and then Helen and I looked around in the stores for the few things we wanted to buy. We ate supper with the Wilcox's and are fixed up for the night in a good hotel. I have come down to the journal office to spend a few minutes with Howard who has had some writing to do and now we are both going back to the hotel for a little visit with his mother. Howard is writing this for me at my dictation and is a very rapid writer\nWe had a pleasant journey. Edward and I enjoyed it very much, but the others got rather tired.\nBryan speaks here tomorrow night, but I fear that we will not be able to remain to hear him.\nHoward sends his love with mine, and will write in a few days.\nMost Affectionately Your Nephew,\nJE.

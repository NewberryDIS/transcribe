I am anxiously looking for the waggon with the cotton, in order to send some things back by here, and also because if I had the cotton now, I could make it equal to eighteen cents to me. I wish you also to let Cesar plant okra, beans &c. &c. in the garden & if Jenny is cook she can work half the day in the garden and do all the cooking at the same time.\nI wish you would speak to the unclear gentleman your father & tell him I request of him if he can possibly spare some of his coarsest pork to let you have a little for my negroes, & if he lets me have any make Cesar salt it up.\nI will write you again by next mail & send you some more money - inclosed is ten dollars to pay for horse collars &c.\nI am very respectfully your friend\nD.B.

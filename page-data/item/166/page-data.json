If I may express a wish so free?\nRespected Friends,\nYours, of the 10th last, has been received and if an early return be the only assurance of its kindly reception, I will speedily reply.  Sister Abby and I are having a holiday today, and met at Home.\nThe news we received of the death of Mrs. Kendall called forth for you our deepest sympathy, which we gladly would have expressed, had not we felt your grief was too deep for interuption?.  And since then we have experienced the truth of this.  Our Loved sister unclear, my brother Chandler's wife, was summoned home in August.  And on the morning of the 4th, she cheerfully smiled a Last Farewell and as we hope and  trust, joined the angel band in Heaven.  How happy the thoughts, that the friends we loved so dearly n Earth, are bright angels in Heaven!  Oh!  That I may so live that when Life is done I may join them there.  \nMr. Kendall you sustain a severe loss in the death of your dear wife.  How true it is that \"Life will not prove all sunshine.\"  Did you ever wonder why under the weight of unclear we must on our journey go? I have sometimes, and yet I know it is right and feel that Our Father knows what is best for his children and when he takes the sunshine from us the stars smile from above."},{"pageid":38837,"pagefilename":"d83ed9169b8d128657cc11fdb583f913.jpg","transcription":"Perhaps the pure spirits of departed friends are near us still, affectionately guarding us from the many trials and temptations thro which life may lead. Even that thought affords consolation, and we look forward to the time when we may be called to share the joys of Heaven, and meet the loved ones gone before.\nI need not tell you that your sentiments and ideas of Home are true and purely Christian. Would there were more such homes than there are. The elevated character you give woman, should be the standard of every female. But I regret that too many prize the butterfly joys of Earth more than the purity and excellence of Christian life!\nSo you have given up teaching and the ministry? I am teaching still and have been since I wrote you, all the time with short vacations only. I thought I should rest this winter, but I couldn't! Why is it that teachers never find a time for rest, or rather rest all the time? \nDo you like your present employment as well as you did teaching or the ministry? No doubt it will be better for your health - I think even now, you need to take good care of your health lest you become an invalid again.\nYou spoke of visiting New England. If so I hope you will come to Warwick. Perhaps you will be able to preach One Sabbath. Mr. Wilson does not preach here now - he has not since last April. Mr Jackson of Walpole is our pastor now, and a good faithful one he is. People generally, like him very much indeed. He is very sincere and his sermons cannot fail to make an impression upon the attentive mind. Perhaps you will be interested to know that brother Chandler, brother Tyler and sister Emily are to be received into the church tomorrow - New Year's Sabbath.\nHow could you think of Mt Grace this cold weather? A single glance only, at its snow-crowned summit would give you the ague (I guess) for even I only gaze when the setting sun throws its genial rays across it. And then such clear cold breezes as it sends down to us - you will smile to know your Warwick friends are 22 degrees below zero!\nI hope to hear from you again - A letter from Mr Kendall will always be welcome at Maple Grove.

Then another thought would follow that you too had gone to the \"Spirit Land\" to be reunited with those dear friends above. But my fears are not realized! God has preserved your life! And I am happy to hear that you are enjoying a good degree of health again. The business in which you are engaged (though rather hazardous) may be the means of restoring to you, permanent health and I think had you continued teaching and preaching together with the great exertions which you would necessarily make and which could not avoid, would have disabled you, perhaps for life. Within a few months, God has seen fit to take back to himself those near, and dear friends, whom he gave you, but for a very short time; and who are now, pure, bright spirits around their Father's Throne in Heaven. How you will miss the many pleasant associations, which you have enjoyed with her, who was the light and joy of your home? Oh! you will grieve a long long time. But your faith in God, will enable you to look above for support. I will extend to you my heartfelt sympathy. And I hope you will find friends who will cheer, and comfort you, while wandering on in the dreary faith of life homeless and alone. Your present occupation must evidently bring you in contact with anxious classes of society. Yet is my opinion that the true Christian principles which have activated you thus far, will preserve you from the thousand temptations, even if you have not the \"purifying influences of home surrounding you.\" Have I not guessed right? Home should be the seat of happiness; else it ought not to bear the title! For no spirit can long resist bad domestic influences! But it does not depend on woman alone for true piety at home. She can do much with her influence, in making a \"Happy home.\" But she needs aid from others. Brother Samuel was married a year ago last Thanksgiving. He lives in the other part of the house.

But he, too, unclear quantity gets the erroneous idea, that woman finds nothing to weary, or perplex her. Therefore it is no effort for her, to greet every one with a cheering word and a happy smile, at all times. But as I think Mr. Kendall, understand human nature exceedingly will. It will not need my arguments to prove it to be otherwise. I guess you have been taking a peep into unclear lectures to young men and women, have you not? I have read some of him and like very much. I intend to finish these, when I can find leisure time. You inquire if we have been teaching? That has been my chief employment. I have taught in this town unclear and have spent every sabbath at my own home with my mother. The school in which I am now engaged consists of about 30 scholars, more than half are males.

We spend several weeks at my unclear, and the nice sea-breezes, will unclear - reslit me up very soon. My seasonal health has been very good. would you like to hear a word from my dear \"California Brother\"? He has been doing exceedingly well for a short past. He had satisfied his golden appetite, and started for home the 29th of Sep. and was shipwrecked the next day, near San Diego.

It has been some time now since we heard from him, and we are feeling rather anxious. You are getting father and farther west, I see, every time we hear from you, and should you really reach California I hope you will look up my brother and bring him unclearto New England with you, in the spring. Shall I not begin to anticipate this visit? Please remember me kindly to your sister Lydia. Oh! I have just thought of that revolver! I think you are becoming quite brave!

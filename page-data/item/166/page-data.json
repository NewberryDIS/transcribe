Kendall and Abby\nWarwick, Jan. 6, 1855.\nA Happy New Year, I wish for thee.  If I may express a wish so free?\nRespected Friends,\nYours, of the 10th last, has been received and if an early return be the only assurance of its kindly reception, I will speedily reply.  Sister Abby and I are having a holiday today, and met at Home.\nThe news we received of the death of Mrs. Kendall called forth for you our deepest sympathy, which we gladly would have expressed, had not we felt your grief was too deep for interuption.  And since then we have experienced the truth of this.  Our Loved sister Zebiah, my brother Chandler's wife, was summoned home in August.  And on the morning of the 4th, she cheerfully smiled a Last Farewell and as we hope and  trust, joined the angel band in Heaven.  How happy the thoughts, that the friends we loved so dearly n Earth, are bright angels in Heaven!  Oh!  That I may so live that when Life is done I may join them there.  \nMr. Kendall you sustain a severe loss in the death of your dear wife.  How true it is that \"Life will not prove all sunshine.\"  Did you ever wonder why under the weight of wo we must on our journey go? I have sometimes, and yet I know it is right and feel that Our Father knows what is best for his children and when he takes the sunshine from us the stars smile from above."},{"pageid":38837,"pagefilename":"d83ed9169b8d128657cc11fdb583f913.jpg","transcription":"Perhaps the pure spirits of departed friends are near us still, affectionately guarding us from the many trials and temptations thro which life may lead. Even that thought affords consolation, and we look forward to the time when we may be called to share the joys of Heaven, and meet the loved ones gone before.\nI need not tell you that your sentiments and ideas of Home are true and purely Christian. Would there were more such homes than there are. The elevated character you give woman, should be the standard of every female. But I regret that too many prize the butterfly joys of Earth more than the purity and excellence of Christian life!\nSo you have given up teaching and the ministry? I am teaching still and have been since I wrote you, all the time with short vacations only. I thought I should rest this winter, but I couldn't! Why is it that teachers never find a time for rest, or rather rest all the time? \nDo you like your present employment as well as you did teaching or the ministry? No doubt it will be better for your health - I think even now, you need to take good care of your health lest you become an invalid again.\nYou spoke of visiting New England. If so I hope you will come to Warwick. Perhaps you will be able to preach One Sabbath. Mr. Wilson does not preach here now - he has not since last April. Mr Jackson of Walpole is our pastor now, and a good faithful one he is. People generally, like him very much indeed. He is very sincere and his sermons cannot fail to make an impression upon the attentive mind. Perhaps you will be interested to know that brother Chandler, brother Tyler and sister Emily are to be received into the church tomorrow - New Year's Sabbath.\nHow could you think of Mt Grace this cold weather? A single glance only, at its snow-crowned summit would give you the ague (I guess) for even I only gaze when the setting sun throws its genial rays across it. And then such clear cold breezes as it sends down to us - you will smile to know your Warwick friends are 22 degrees below zero!\nI hope to hear from you again - A letter from Mr Kendall will always be welcome at Maple Grove. Affectionately, your friend, as ever, Mary A. Reed."},{"pageid":38842,"pagefilename":"ca80068b7cd88bb5cf77b6b8b8c7285e.jpg","transcription":"Abby to Nathan [June 1855]\n\nSaturday PM \nI was very happy to hear from you again Mr.Kendall and will assure you that it was very welcomely received by the \"Original Abby and Mary.\" So long a time had elapsed since we last heard from you, that I began to think you seriously ill and unable to write. Then another thought would follow that you too had gone to the \"Spirit Land\" to be reunited with those dear friends above. But my fears are not realized! God has preserved your life! And I am happy to hear that you are enjoying a good degree of health again. The business in which you are engaged (though rather hazardous) may be the means of restoring to you, permanent health and I think had you continued teaching and preaching together with the great exertions which you would necessarily make and which could not avoid, would have disabled you, perhaps for life. Within a few months, God has seen fit to take back to himself those near, and dear friends, whom he gave you, but for a very short time; and who are now, pure, bright spirits around their Father's Throne in Heaven. How you will miss the many pleasant associations, which you have enjoyed with her, who was the light and joy of your home? Oh! you will grieve a long long time. But your faith in God, will enable you to look above for support. I will extend to you my heartfelt sympathy. And I hope you will find friends who will cheer, and comfort you, while wandering on in the dreary faith of life homeless and alone. Your present occupation must evidently bring you in contact with anxious classes of society. Yet is my opinion that the true Christian principles which have activated you thus far, will preserve you from the thousand temptations, even if you have not the \"purifying influences of home surrounding you.\" Have I not guessed right? Home should be the seat of happiness; else it ought not to bear the title! For no spirit can long resist bad domestic influences! But it does not depend on woman alone for true piety at home. She can do much with her influence, in making a \"Happy home.\" But she needs aid from others.\n\n[left-hand side]  Brother Samuel was married a year ago last Thanksgiving. He lives in the other part of the house. Chandler boards with Mother and Mr .Jackson also. Our family wish to be remembered particularly Jesse.\nYour friend, Abby."},{"pageid":38844,"pagefilename":"247c2733c0cc7dc721bcd13147cdbc41.jpg","transcription":"Does it not need all the good moral influences of both sexes, after all, to make a home as beautiful and bright, as you represented in your letter? Every home ought, as might, compare well with your description.But how many there are, that, fall far, far below! But it would be otherwise. I think, could every person understand, (as I think you do). The secrets, by which a home is made happy. Man delights in enterprise and action. And exerts his whole moral force in the conflicts of the world. His feelings are constantly annoyed, by perpetual irritations, and disappointments. And his home should be a place of cheerfulness and comfort in order to sustain him. His soul will then renew its strength, and he will again go forth to encounter the troubles of the world. But he, too, frequently gets the erroneous idea, that woman finds nothing to weary, or perplex her. Therefore it is no effort for her, to greet every one with a cheering word and a happy smile, at all times. But as I think Mr. Kendall, understand human nature exceedingly will. It will not need my arguments to prove it to be otherwise. I guess you have been taking a peep into Eliot's lectures to young men and women, have you not? I have read some of him and like very much. I intend to finish these, when I can find leisure time. You inquire if we have been teaching? That has been my chief employment. I have taught in this town altogether. And have spent every sabbath at my own home with my mother. The school in which I am now engaged consists of about 30 scholars, more than half are males. I have about a dozen young ladies and gentlemen who's ages are from 18 to 21. Some of the young men are very tall and I am obliged to \"look up\"considerable to get a peep into their faces! After I closed my fall term. Mother, uncle, sister Mary, and myself went to Springfield to spend Thanksgiving with my mother's only sister. We were there a fortnight. I had a delightful visit and came home feeling refreshed, both in body and mind - already to begin my winter's work. But I am getting rather weary again. And I think after finishing my school, sister Mary and myself will visit Boston and Barnstable on the Cape. We shall spend several weeks at my Uncle's, and the nice sea-breezes, will recruit me up very soon. My seasonal health has been very good. would you like to hear a word from my dear \"California Brother\"? He has been doing exceedingly well for a short past. He had satisfied his golden appetite, and started for home the 29th of Sep. and was shipwrecked the next day, near San Diego. He with the other passengers (consisting of nearly 1000) were taken back to San Francisco. He has since gone back to the mines. It has been some time now since we heard from him, and we are feeling rather anxious. You are getting father and farther west, I see, every time we hear from you, and should you really reach California I hope you will look up my brother and bring him to New England back with you, in the spring. Shall I not begin to anticipate this visit? Please remember me kindly to your sister Lydia. Oh! I have just thought of that revolver! I think you are becoming quite brave! May this letter find you well. I should be happy, very, to continue our correspondence - Good night and a happy Near year.

My school this \nwinter has been pleasant, but rather hard. The examination was\nlast Saturday week. Everything passed off pleasantly and satisfactorily.\nI guess - for they expressed a wish that I would teach\nthe school next season. The family with whom I boarded live a\nmile from the schoolhouse, and consequently I was favored with many\na sleigh-ride. The last two weeks, however, we had no snow, and the \nroad being very rough, I walked generally. This exercise, together with\nthe labor in the school-room were quite fatiguing.

I believe that a majority of not only women,\nbut men,  have a desire for “soul companionship”, and many hopes\nblighted by not finding in a companion, this spiritual relationship.\nBut I have already said too much on this subject, inexperienced as \nI am. Pardon me; and I will try to serve up something else.\nMary and I have anticipated visiting the “Cafe” after having\nfinished our schools.

I am happy, my dear friend, that you think of me thus, & that something told you right about my heart's affections, & after a continued correspondence, if we find ourselves congenial spirits, & think it best to be united, be assured that my heart's best affections shall be bestowed upon you, & in return I shall expect the same assurance from you.

You ought to take time, turn your attention from business as much as possible, & rest, both your body & your mind. I wish I could assist you in your business , so that you could get more time to rest. Do you not think I can assist you a little, when I become your wife? I do not believe but what I can. I shall have to be your pupil awhile, & then, perhaps, I can be your assistant. Does Mr. Kendall favor this idea? Do you rest better night now, than you did? I hope you have got rid of your cold. And you will be very careful in future won't you, my dear Mr. Kendall?

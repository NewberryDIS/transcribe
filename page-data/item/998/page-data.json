There is to be a Review and Dress Parade this evening if the weather is favorable Nelson H. Davis.  Col and Inspector General is now making an inspection of the Dept. of Texas and is expected here soon.  I shall endeavor to let him know our wants in relation to material for repairs - quarters etc. etc. and obtain his favorable recommendation for the same if possible.  the little City of South Angillo hear here on the North Concho is the County Seat of this great Concho Co. as yet however altho' they have the full complement of County Officers ready to serve the State and their County - no public buildings have as yet been erected.  the said city in reality is only the place where the County ((seat?)) is to be established.  Now this whole section of the County is overrun with the greatest set of scoundrels that ever lived on the face of the Earth and went ((wandering?))  and constant murders are committed and robberies being perpetrated.  The Sheriff of the County is a gambler and keeps a drinking saloon in the City ((Aforesaid?)).  He is as great a rascal as any no doubt.  Altogether they have ((lively times?)) and frequent arrest are made and as the City is not provided with a jail these rascals have to be  confined in the guard house.  I have notified the said Civil Authorities that they must find some other plan for their ((unclear))rascals which will no longer be kept and fed at the guard House and that they must be provided for elsewhere."},{"pageid":65020,"pagefilename":"43237972d0042c1183deb37072bddf82.jpg","transcription":"1875 June 22nd 8 P.M.\nMy dear A -\nthis has been another very long day and comin out from the office this A.M. about 11 O'Clock having on my military Cap and having lately had my hair cut I came near having a stroke of the sun.

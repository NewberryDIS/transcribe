Dec 6, 1830\nBrother Kimball,\nYour Letter of Oct 27, gave me pleasure.  Though it has lain before me a week or two, I have neglected answering, hesitating how I could get the fullest, most inteligible, & correct answer before you.  Facts which have fallen under my eyes, in travelling through the state 200 miles from North to south, some distance from East to West, up the Missippi, & thence up the Illinois River on its East side, in the sundy school service, together with those which I have obtained upon what I consider the best information, & my opinion respecting upon them, I could not communicate without filling a number of sheets.  I am thinking of publishing a few numbers, before long, that is, as soon as I can possibly get time to write them, in the Newspaper of this place, in answer to your queries, If I should do this I will not fail to forward the papers containing the numbers [to?] you.  In the meantime I will state what I can in this letter.        My journey I consider prosperous, but a little more expensive than I had calculated.  As I lingered in Ohio some weeks, my entrance into this region was in a season of the year, unfavorable to the health of newcomers.  Yet I have not for some years enjoyed, for the same length of time, so good health, as since I left Dudley.  And in this connection it ought to be borne in mind, that I had been of a strongly billious habit for 15 or 20 years, & frequently laid up for a day or two, by billious irregularity of the bowels, & yet I have not confined myself to the most healthy part of the country, but in my travels have taken it just as it came.  My Daughters have enjoyed fine health, but they have been much more confined.  My sons have had the fever & ague, but are now in good health.  The past season, (& the sickly months are August, Sept. & Oct.) is extensively spoken of as more sickly, than any preceding season for a number of years.  Yet I verily believe it has not been, excepting upon the Bottom lands, & in the neighborhood of creeks, more sickly than it ordinarily is in New England at the same season of the year.  The country from the Eastern part of Ohio to the Missippi has undoubtedly a billious tendency.  This is manifest in the countenances of the inhabitants.  As soon as I entered Ohio, & so ever since, I saw less of the rose on the cheek, & more of a sallow appearance, than what prevails in the East....And almost every where in this widely extended region, the chill & fever are occasionally felt.  But it is a poor country for Doctors.  The fevers have a remarkable similarity; & may be treated with a good degree of safety in a very uniform"},{"pageid":57067,"pagefilename":"396ccf0910c2f4abea84294a68b7b4f9.jpg","transcription":"way.  This is so well understood, that the inhabitants are generally their own physicians, & in this they succeed well.\nBut before proceeding further I will be a little more personal.  After making up my mind, not to settle at Rock Spring, I pretty much determined that I should settle somewhere in the northern part of the state.  And in travelling up the Illinois River through the counties of Green, Morgan, Sangamo, & Tazwell, I was much pleased with the country.  And I understood that in the direction of the Illinois River even to Michigan Lake, & that a considerable proportion of the large country between the Illinois & Missisippi Rivers, is remarkably fine.  I am however for the present settled in Kaskaskia, on account of a favorable offer of a school $550 for myself & Sophia 44 weeks... The school is select & very pleasant & affords the best opportunity for the education of my younger children.  I have no lamentation that I removed to this state.  Were I back in New England, with my present knowledge of this country, my first object would be to remove yet it is not a paradise.\nMonied capitital is greatly wanted, & can in various ways be employed to advantage.  Of this the rate of interest is a sufficient proof, which upon an average, I think is not less than 10 percent in the south part of the state, & from 10 to 25, & sometimes even 50 per cent in the North part of it.  Agricultural labor here is nominally somewhat lower than in the East, but perhaps really higher, as people do not labor nearly so hard as there.  Mechanical labor of almost all kinds is decidedly higher.  The morals of the countrey are not so unfavorable as I expected.  There is indeed a pretty strong tincture of the back woods character, open hearted free expressions of feeling.  This is manifest in religious meetings in which there is more noise than with you.  And it is as I understand, not from much that I have seen, on public occasions when whiskey gets into the head, noise, & among a small class of people quarrels.  Yet I see not but a sober strait forward man is as safe from violence & insults as in the East.  The electioneering spirit, as in all the southern states, is carried, as it seems to an Eastern man to a great extent.  Constant & excessive drinking, I think, does not prevail more in this state than in the East, probably not so much.  There is I am confident less drunked in private, but perhaps more in social ?, on public occasions.  There many drink freely, who drink almost no spirit in the interval between such occasions.\nReligion is not in so favorable a state as in the East; neither is it so far behind as is sometimes represented.  The Methodists are the most numerous, next the Baptists then the Presbyterians.  Schools are low, as they always must be in a new countrey.  But they are rising, & it is a general opinion that the state of society is improving.--  Water power is scarse from this point 150 miles North.  No streams afford a constant & even supply of water for turning which   as a general characteristic in the dry season they are too small, & in very high water flood the wheel.  But few mills will run well more than nine months in a year.  But further north water powerer is said to be good.  Ox power & streams are much depended on for milling.  This you will understand is much more expensive then the New England streams."},{"pageid":57069,"pagefilename":"3d3e0323663988a4b434610186e1b42d.jpg","transcription":"Stock pretty universally runs at large, & even in the dry season, finds water enough within a mile or so.  But when they shall be enclosed which probably must be within a few years, dependance must be had in a great measure upon wells even for stock.  But almost universally water enough may be found by digging from 15 to 40 feet.  This is generally pretty good, but not so good as it is in the East.\nI rest my opinion of the future prosperity of the country upon the extraordinary fertility of the soil, & the tolerable salubrity of the climate.  This I apprehend must decide.  Business is not yet regulated, but it must in a few years be as well regulated as in the East after there shall be due competition in all its departments.  Illinois, rather than Missouri, or Indiana, or Ohio, holds out the greatest encouragements to emigrants, whether farmers, mechanics, or merchants.  Indeed the emigration from Ohio here is very great as well as from others.  It is now probably the most favorable time for making settlements.  Emigrants ten years ago, had greater room to select the place & to obtain land at bargain prices.  But the character of the countrey, & the central points for business were not ascertained, & things which they had to purchase excessively high, & milling could not be obtained without great difficulty.  I think my removal was in time for the countrey.  And pretty certainly a few years hence, the countrey will afford an encouragement to emigrants than at present.  Mechanics, who have barely a sufficient capital to set up their business, have a fair prospect of doing well.  And farmers, who can command only 200 or 300 Dollars may soon, if prospered, put themselves into an easy state for a good living.  But it must be very desirable that emigrants, should know before they come, where to settle, especially if they have families.  For it is expensive having a family boarded until a man can take a tour of the state, & make understandingly a selection for himself.  If they think of coming on in companies, it may be well worth their while to send a judicious agent to look out for a settlement, that after having made a thorough examination, he might lead them directly to the spot.  Much better to expend a little money in previous examination, than to be kept upon expense in the countrey with a family until a journey of some hundred miles can be made.  But the agent may want his money with him, or at his command, so that he can secure the purchase, the moment he makes up his mind what to purchase.\nIn regard to regions of settlement I have mentioned the northern one.  And yet for ought I see, here is a wide extent of countrey, in which there is not room for strong preference.  A thousand eligible settlements might be made within 20 miles of Kaskaskia.  And so almost any where above.\nI am aware Dear Sir that I have not answered all your questions, & it is because I could not in a letter.  I will endeavor to give you further information hereafter in some way or other.  I rejoice in learning your welfare, & the enlargement of the church which I left.  I should indeed rejoice to meet you & my friends in your village.  Please to accept my kind regards & to present the same to Mrs Kimball, also to Mr Hester? and his Lady, & to the Dean? and his family ?\nAffectionately yours\nH.

Instead of any personal opposition to the treaty party, many of them were among my most favorite friends. This was the case especially with the family connections? of Messrs. Ridge, and Boudinot. To them I was more especially indebted for ten thousand acts of kindness, than to almost any other families in the nation. And when I heard that the treaty was ratified, and knew in some measure, at least, the feelings of the people, and the consequent danger of Messrs. Ridge and Boudinot, I would not rest without advising them to take some measures to regain the favour of the people. As Mr. Northrop, Mr? Ridge's father, was then on a visit, at the house of Mr Ridge & addressed my letter to him, that he might, as he should judge expedient, read or communicate it to Mr. Ridge. I commenced by saying, that, though I might not be a politician, yet I might be a peace maker; and as a friend I begged the privilege of suggesting a few thoughts to our friends Ridge and Boudinot with regard to their endeavoring to communicate the minds of the people and the national council. I enquired if they could not address a communication to the general council, acknowledging the importance of the law they had violated, than in all communities, holding land in common, it was of vital importance that it should not be at the disposition of any one or two individuals but of a majority, or persons authorized by a majority; and that, under any common circumstances, they could not expect forgiveness in thus acting for the nation, But the condition of the nation was peculiar. These I proposed to them to state, in the clearest manner possible, the oppressive measures of Georgia and Alabama, by which the whole nation had been brought to the very verge of ruin, and urge that distress as a reason why they had adopted a measure which might be considered desperate, in order"},{"pageid":71680,"pagefilename":"faef6939c78ff22a0c2acba5fe3f9f62.jpg","transcription":"to pluck the people from the mouth of the lion, from that oppressive grasp likely to chill all the blood in their veins.

Then let them call all who signed the treaty, to sign this communication to the national council, so as to divide the responsibility as far as possible, that it might not rest on two or three individuals. I also advised our friends to avoid any thing like extravagance in their dress or equipage and let their appearance rather indicate poverty than riches. As the above communication was was? disregarded, and my friends seemed to seek safety only in reliance on assistance from the United States, which tended rather to wound? the feelings of the nation.

I will attend to the note as soon as I learn of this money being paid.\nI may say that my mistake in overdrawing my account was one of the results of renting the farm through an agent and not directly. The terms were somewhat different from those of preceding years, the first payment being in November instead of earlier in the year. I had no paid especial attention to that provision and had forgotten it and so presumed there was plenty of money in the bank. However, I think I am getting a better rent than if I had done the business myself.\nSincerely yours,\nJ..Ed. Everett.\nP.S. Let me know, please, whether it will be all right for me to defer payment till the rent money is paid in November 3. J.E.E.\nAll right.

Our jeweler here says the watch can be packed easily in a box large enough so that quite a good of paper can be put around it, and that the only thing to be done besides packing it snugly is to take a very small of slip of paper, double it, so that it forms a weak spring, and place it under the balance wheel, - under one side of the balance wheel - so that it will keep the wheel from moving. Do not put yourselves to inconvenience. I think it entirely improbably that you can get it here in time; and if you do not it will not make much difference to me.

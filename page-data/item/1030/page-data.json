His band is not a large one, and I have reason to believe that during the past year has not been a very troublesome one.  I cannot, of course, be certain of this, but I am almost certain that most of the Indian troubles in this Department for the past two years have come from the Minnecanjous  - the Northern Cheyennes - the irregular bands heretofore on the Republican under \"Pawnee Killer\", \"Whistler\", and other, and"},{"pageid":68635,"pagefilename":"fe01c5fcc92c5f009ba2a80f0cb7c6b9.jpg","transcription":"probably part of the Northern Arrapahoes, with a sprinkling of Unkpapa's, and others from the North.\nRed Cloud cannot control any of these bands, and his influence with them will be no greater than that of Spotted Tail.

A successful Headsoldier can at all times control the fighting men of the band, and through them the band itself, and it not unfrequently happens that this control is divided between two or three soldiers.  The complications arising from this system are endless, and very embarrassing in any effort to master the Indian question.  Red Cloud himself is not a legitimate chief, only a successful soldier of the Ogallala band, and even in his immediate band his authority is divided with his brother \"Long Chin\", another successful soldier.\nI have taken the liberty to write the above that no undue expectations may be formed from any amicable arrangements made with Red Cloud.

The late Secretary of War was a Civil officer purely, and, whatever his shortcomings, they are in no way chargeable to the army.  He never belonged to the army in any way, except as a volunteer officer during the war of the rebellion, when his services were held to have been at the least very creditable. If you regard the transfer of the Indian bureau to the War department as injudicious and wrong, I recognize fully your right to oppose it, and to strengthen your opposition by all fair arguments you can find. But in doing so, is it necessary or just to vilify and malign officers of the army, without furnishing some proof or evidence of their guilt?"},{"pageid":68690,"pagefilename":"f5230043066c8666d61e0724c0aeffe5.jpg","transcription":"Who are the \"several men of the Army who have given signal proofs\" of dishonesty; and where is the evidence to sustain such a charge?

If the Churchman is in possession of such evidence, ought it to have made its charge of dishonesty, without referring to it? You may ask \"what about General Babcock\" ? I have only to answer that he has been tried by a competent court and acquitted of the charges against him. Moreover, whatever he may have done amiss is in no way connected with the army.

It should be borne in mind that every one of these officers has served for many years in direct contact with the indians, and know their needs, their wrongs, and their peculiarities, from long and close personal observation.

In regard to Lieutenant Pratt who has charge of the indian prisoners at St. Augustine: He has had a most difficult and delicate duty to perform in connection with them, for they are recognized as among the very worst of our indians.

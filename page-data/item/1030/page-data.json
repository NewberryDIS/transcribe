His band is not a large one, and I have reason to believe that during the past year has not been a very troublesome one.  I cannot, of course, be certain of this, but I am almost certain that most of the Indian troubles in this Department for the past two years have come from the Minnecanjous  - the Northern Cheyennes - the irregular bands heretofore on the Republican under \"Pawnee Killer\", \"Whistler\", and other, and"]},{"pageid":68635,"pagefilename":"fe01c5fcc92c5f009ba2a80f0cb7c6b9.jpg","transcription":["probably part of the Northern Arrapahoes, with a sprinkling of Unkpapa's, and others from the North.\nRed Cloud cannot control any of these bands, and his influence with them will be no greater than that of Spotted Tail.

A successful Headsoldier can at all times control the fighting men of the band, and through them the band itself, and it not unfrequently happens that this control is divided between two or three soldiers.  The complications arising from this system are endless, and very embarrassing in any effort to master the Indian question.  Red Cloud himself is not a legitimate chief, only a successful soldier of the Ogallala band, and even in his immediate band his authority is divided with his brother \"Long Chin\", another successful soldier.\nI have taken the liberty to write the above that no undue expectations may be formed from any amicable arrangements made with Red Cloud.

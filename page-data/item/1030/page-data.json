He thinks such a post should be established there at once, and directed me to so write to you for the information of the General in Chief.  There are two companies of 2d Cavalry now there.

While I think it very desirable that Red Cloud should be confirmed in what seems to be his present friendly disposition, I feel it my duty to state my opinion that, however successful the Government may be in doing this, it will be no mans stop Indian depredations on the plains.  I do this as I see by the papers, that an impression prevails at the East that Red Cloud is the head and front of all the hostile bands.  Nothing can be further from the truth.  His band is not a large one, and I have reason to believe that during the past year has not been a very troublesome one.  I cannot, of course, be certain of this, but I am almost certain that most of the Indian troubles in this Department for the past two years have come from the Minnecanjous  - the Northern Cheyennes - the irregular bands heretofore on the Republican under \"Pawnee Killer\", \"Whistler\", and other, and"},{"pageid":68635,"pagefilename":"fe01c5fcc92c5f009ba2a80f0cb7c6b9.jpg","transcription":"probably part of the Northern Arrapahoes, with a sprinkling of Unkpapa's, and others from the North.\nRed Cloud cannot control any of these bands, and his influence with them will be no greater than that of Spotted Tail.  I think it will be found that any Chief or Headman, who becomes friendly to the whites, will cease to exert any influence over the hostiles, unless of his immediate family.\nThe Sioux are divided into some eighteen different bands, all independent of each other, and without a controlling authority in any one of them.\nThe introduction amongst them of what is known as \"Soldiers\", has impaired, and in many cases entirely destroyed the authority of the legitimate chiefs.  A successful Headsoldier can at all times control the fighting men of the band, and through them the band itself, and it not unfrequently happens that this control is divided between two or three soldiers.  The complications arising from this system are endless, and very embarrassing in any effort to master the Indian question.  Red Cloud himself is not a legitimate chief, only a successful soldier of the Ogallala band, and even in his immediate band his authority is divided with his brother \"Long Chin\", another successful soldier.\nI have taken the liberty to write the above that no undue expectations may be formed from any amicable arrangements made with Red Cloud.

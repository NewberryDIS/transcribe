I write in haste just to blot out that streak of blueness.  There is no use in being blue.  It is neither food nor raiment nor faith.  So cheer up.  It made me rejoice to learn how much indebtedness you had paid up.  I think you are doing first rate.  I am glad you have got your farm safe in your hands.  I was a little afraid there might be some slip, between the cup & lip.  If you are square with Erasmus, that is another thing to rejoice over.\nI know you are not well,"},{"pageid":42383,"pagefilename":"bdfa6f1efd8f12dc02a866638cc9699a.jpg","transcription":"but that is a burden you have always borne.

Probably you cannot hope for a long life counted in years; but \"that life is long that answers life's great error\".  True life is not reckoned in years, but in spiritual attainment.

Christ, through faith, gives wings by which the soul may rise suspended above sensuous things.  This is the raising up which Christ gives to souls that enter into his order of life.  Bushnell states my views on this point.\nNo, I have not touched Father Abraham yet - am not certain I can make your view clear to others, though I incline to it.\nLast Sunday I preached on \"Put up thy sword\", a peace sermon - antiwar - claiming that the time has come for a republican world government, or a republic of all nations, by which all international"},{"pageid":42385,"pagefilename":"172feef9c0577e05a26bf75c5f975b9e.jpg","transcription":"relations & difficulties shall be settled.\nSunday before My theme was \"Many are called but few chosen\", which suited so well I shall repeat it in a few weeks.

Thy have formed a literary society.  All goes well.  Our meetings all keep up their interest.  All's well, but money matters.  As usual cash is low -- we run on credit.  We shall bring up at last.

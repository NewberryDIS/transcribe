Dec 22, '51. \nMy dear Mother,\nYour letter came Saturday night, and it seemed as I could hardly wait for Monday morning to come, that I might answer it and relieve your anxiety about me. I was very sorry when I read your letter and found how uneasy you were, that I had not written several days before, as I ought to have done, to tell you how nicely I am getting along. The only excuse I have is, that I was waiting to hear from your first; which you know is not a very good one, as I knew all the time that you would be anxious about me. And now, my dear mother, I must ask you to forgive me and I will try to do better in future. Do not give yourself any anxiety for fear of Mrs. Burchad distressing me, for she is a great deal better. I have not heard hardly anything of her for two weeks; she is very quiet indeed now, and in a great many things, quite rational. Dr. has strong hopes that she will recover. She walks out every day with either husband or nurse and comes back as quietly as any one. You ask if I am able to keep warm now?

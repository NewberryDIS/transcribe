He was wholly devoted to his task and I think strove so to conduct his school that it would be of the greatest advantage to all those under his charge.  The thought almost startles me, when I recollect, that since then nearly nine months of my time has been spent attending school, and still that there is so much left I had desired to learn ere I left school as a scholar.

Soon after receiving the sorrowful intelligence of Mrs. Kendall's deceased I wrote to Mrs. Weaver and expressed our sympathy with you all in your deep affection.  It afforded us a melancholly pleasure to read the particulars of our dear friend's death, for how beautiful was her calmness at the hour of departing, and how consoling to your afflicted heart to hear from her own life assurance of continued watchfulness and affection in her Home beyond the skies.  Blessed thought for those who are this suddenly delivered of the society of dear friends, to know that while they feel sad and lonely, the Angel spirits of the departed are happy in Heaven.  It seems only natural that she should have felt this resigned for those who are as well prepared to live as she was are always prepared to die.  Hers was a Christian life in the highest acceptation of the term, corresponding in every particulars with a beautiful verse I committed to memory a short time since showing who might be considered true Christians.

They shivered from the cool and from their nerves. Torches were lighted, tent stakes driven more securely; canvas wagon-tops were roped to the bodies.\nThe thunder which had been subded like the a ball rolling down a blowling alley became sharp as like the ball when it makes a strike; it grew loud, heavy, and cracked like the sky Clarles looked at his watch. There were but twenty four seconds between the lightening and the resultant thunder; the lightening was five miles distant. It became more blinding, the thunder more intense. The whole western sky was alight; it was a great mass of black rolling, churning squall clouds, which raced with unbelievable swiftness toward the encampment.\nThe breeze which had ceased for a spell, to gather breath and strength, now veered to the north west. At first it was gentle, cool, and refreshing, thenit was a puff and came in capful, boyantly and half joyfully, then angrily; it became a cold, wild, howling fury; it whistled throug the wagons and the trees; it moaned, and groaned, and roared withalmost hurricae force the wind was the vanguard. A prairie storm is a terrifying thing. The lightening was blinding, the thunder deafening; the willos beside the creek bent in long sweeping curves, leaves were torn from the trees, and branches of the cotton-woods snapped and fell. Torches which, but a few moments before, were seen moving about neighboring camps were extinguished. The rain struck; it came in horizontal sheets, all the broad world was shut out in the onrush; each raindrop was like the prick of a needle. THe mules turned tail to the storm; they stuck theit tail between their legs at half mast and their heads and their long ears drooped.\nThe sotrm of wind and rain increased.

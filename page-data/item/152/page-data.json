John\nOsawatomie July 4 1866.\nDear Mary\nI thank you very much for your faithfulness in writing, & particularly for telling me so much about the children. I will not write much this morning. First to answer your questions. I am not doing any thing about the building just now. My health has been rather poor for a little over a week. Very bad headache part of the time and disordered stomach. Am feeling rather better now. Sleep will which helps my head. Frank says you are really mistaken if you think he never wants to see New York again. I asked him if he was tired of cooking? No, he said, but he wanted to see all the folks again. He rather liked to cook. - We keep our best clothes partly in the trunk, and partly hung up.

This morning I had a cup of coffee for the first time at our own table since I have been back, and my head don't ache. But I question whether that is a good way of getting rid of headache. But I hope I am getting rid of it by the natural process. It is a bright beautiful day for the fourth. Frank is going to a Sabbath School picnic. I do not know where I shall go - perhaps to plow corn. I am very glad to hear that Robert is getting along so well in his Arithmetic. Is he learning to write any? We found some nearly ripe apples in Mrs. Mendenhall's orchard this morning. I wished I could give some to the children. I am sorry I can not as yet give a better account of my building.

The unclear was never so welcome before. We had not a word from home by mail since we had been in the territory. A Mr Knox from Rex? Corners, Oneida Co had brought us a letter from Jane. When we got the unclear we had seen almost no newspapers since we had been in the territory. No Tribune later than March 27. So the news we got in the Cen. was very acceptable. We had a chance to send to Lawrence next day to have our letters forwarded from there. Have not yet got them. Got your letter, dated April 30, last Thursday evening. Were very glad to hear from you. I presume you will have seen the letter we wrote to Robert by Mr Knox. I have not much news to send. Emigrants continue to crowd into the country. The man who assumes the chief management in this settlement, Mr Brown, is not at all truthful. So most of those who come here now go away again. In fact the wood about here is all taken about, or covered by claims in some way. There are many false claims however, when one man tries to hold more than his share. Those who get on to such claims, although their legal right is perfect, generally have some trouble with them. We are having a little trouble with ours. The Justice of the Peace here assures us that our right under the preemption law is indisputable, and that we shall be protected in our rights. Still we may be defrauded.

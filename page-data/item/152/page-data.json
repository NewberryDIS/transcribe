I like the arrangement at South Hadley very much which compels the pupils to exercise so much. Let your walks seem as spontaneous to you as possible. Enjoy them as much as possible - not as tasks - but as every day renewed and inestimable privileges of going at your will, and wandering in the glorious picture gallery of our Heavenly Father. Under the blue Heavens, on the soft green grass, with trees waving their leafy honors around and on every side of us, \"all men meet together\" - \"God is the Maker of us all,m\" How admirably has he fitted us to enjoy nature, and made nature for our enjoyment. Many a little spot of deep blue sky guarded and environed by fleecy clouds will sometimes give me a feeling of happiness, almost an ecstasy of enjoyment which a king might envy. The spring beauties have come at last to our woods, and that little modest pure white flower that grows by their side (I do not remember its name. Thus \"the beauty of the Lord our God shines upon us.\"\nI have been very busy the last week in setting out my trees. I have set out between 130 and 140. We had a busy time of it, for I took great pains to set them as I thought they would grow unclear. They are set 28 feet every way - every tree (except the outside ones) being at the centre of six others.

Spring and summer - the maiden and the matron - have come both together this year. We had a glorious day yesterday - beautiful as a dream of heaven. The sky seemed to clothe itself in smiles and to come near to us; the grass growed visibly - its beautiful green getting every hour more enchanting.

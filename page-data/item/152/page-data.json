Dear Eddie Yours from ? was received about noon today. I am getting along well here better than at the Hospital. I have had a walk yesterday with cousin. We went to Jefferson Park, and walked twice around it. Today we walked four times around the Park, making over a mile and a half - besides the distance from here to the Park. It was very refreshing to sit out of doors. Both eyes were tied with and cotton bandage over the sore. My eye is getting better every day. It seems less sore now than at all. All that I have to complain of here is that I am treated too well. I am sorry I cannot be with you too.

Mr. Stott the jeweler fitted or inserted the sheeted glass. But it was a little too large, and the screw consequently too short. So it came loose the next morning on rubbing the glasses.

He said he was used to trying that. He found a wheezing in the right but none in the left lung. I have taken a little cold, and yesterday he could hear it in his chair three or four feet off. I thought I would mention this, although I do not attach much importance to it. I took one dose (1/2 teaspoonful) of the Ex coca yesterday, and one the day before. It seems to quicken the action of the bowels. Day before yesterday I took the Phosphorous three times. Yesterday omitted it. Today I shall take it again. I am getting a little more strength, but not to boast of much.

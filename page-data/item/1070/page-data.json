I may first observe that Indians keep no register of their births, but their ages may be determined with in a year or two by comparing with them the ages of their English neighbours or some remarkable event, which we can ascertain the date of. This is the measure I have used.\nThe Popmunnuck family in first in dignity among my people and affords the most instances of longevity. \nPopmunnuck appeared as first of this tribe in the year 1648 and lived till after 1680. He left at least three sons, but I am \"not\" crossed out able to give the christian names of only Simon and Caleb.\nSimon succeeded Mr. Richard Bourn as pastor to this Church and lived till \"about\" crossed off 1720 when he was a very old man. Three of his children were living when I came here in 1757 viz Isaac, Experience and Josiah. Issac for many years\nx Simon might live till 1727. Mr. Joseph Boum succeeded him and he was not ordained before Dec. 1729. Simon was not able to preach sometime before his Death--Mr. Bourn relinquish'd his Mission in 1742, at his own request--- written vertically in left margin"},{"pageid":72421,"pagefilename":"65c6871bdbcf2cc61e73a16d0c140e65.jpg","transcription":"years was a deacon of this Church & an Indian magistrate of great reputation. He was blind when I first saw him and died in April 1758 when he could not be less than Eighty three. He never had but one Son that I heard of, who died October 1767 aged about 67 having the same year appeared as the Speaker & cheif of his tribe upon a publick occasion.\nExperience sister to Isaac died Novr 1767 having been blind \"for\" crossed out many years. I saw her spin[n]ing once, when her sight could scarcely distinguish the day from night; which was in the year 1759. She could not be less than Fourscore and five at her death. Josiah her brother lived till last March, when he died being about Fourscore & five years old. He had been a schoolmaster and taught a school of Indian children after I came to this mission: But he was blind several years before his death-- I return to\nCaleb Popmunnuck son of the first sachem and Simon brother, who was \"for\" crossed off many years a famous Indian magistrate. I have seen the tree where it is said delinquents were ordered by him to be bound & chastized. He lived to be a very old man; and left one Son, who was living when I came here, and died in my neighbourhood, in January 1767; when he could not be less than Fourscore & ten. He for many years when by the name of Old Zephaniah. We have two Persons of the Popmunnucks, a man and his sister, now living, near or quite eighty years old-- My good Deacon Popmunnuck, however, died 22 October last, when he was about fifty \"had but just turned fifty\" crossed out: being a sober wellbeheaved man, his death is a great & irreparable loss. He was a great help to me.--"},{"pageid":72422,"pagefilename":"5386f2a67e9244ef782c6b50b64a41fd.jpg","transcription":"I will mention a few more instances of great age, who were not related to the sachems family, that I know of.\nIn 1759 died Mercy Richards, aged as was supposed Ninety years. She left a sister, Deborah Wampum, by estimation now above Fourscore, who is likely to live many years.\nIn 1763 died widow Peage about Ninety years of age. A year or two before her death, in the begin[n]ing of March, came up a snow Storm attended with a wind, which soon carried away the roof of her wigwam. The old squaw was alone. After the storm on the next day, one of her neighbours being anxious for her health went to see how she had weathered it.\"the storm.\" crossed out She found her bed, on which she lay, covered with a bank of snow, and so deep that there was no appearance of her blankets, which covered her. However she answered from under the snow, with the voice of health, vigor & cheerfulness.---- In 1765 died Widow Absolom aged about Ninety.\nI can give only these instances of longevity among my people except it is that of Old Timothy Right, who is in his 86th year, and whom I married, the week before last, to a squaw under fifty. Timothy is a very sensible man, but hath not been remarkable for his temperance. I heard one of his cotempories among the English say \"that Tim. Right had drank many a hogshead of rum\". However, he has rarely drank to intoxication, and has many qualities that have always made him respectable among Indians & English. The begining of this month, at the court of quarter Sessions, he, upon oath, gave an evidence to a fact?, said to be Fourscore years old, of which he was an eyewitness.

At Stockbridge Captn Kunkapot* was for many years the oldest man of his tribe. I am not certain how great his age was when he died; but am persuaded that it had not exceeded Eighty. \nOf Johnson's Mohawks * Abraham, a brother of the famous Hendrick, was the oldest of his tribe. I saw him in 1756, a few months before his death; when he did not appear to be Threescore & ten-- I saw a sister of theirs in 1765 who appeared to be above Seventy and is probably yet living\nAmong the Onohoqugas I never saw one of their men who had arrived to Threescore. Whither the small pox carried off their old men in the year 1745 I am not able to say-- There is a village of Tuskaroras near Onohoquaga where I have seen very old persons, both male & female, who were born in N. Carolina, near the sea shore, and from whence they removed about the year 1711 and settled where I found them.\nI am, with great Sincerity, \nRev Sir,\nyour most humble Servt\nGideon Hawley\n\n Kunkapot was very sober & temperate, all his days & He was remarkable on his stability.\n Abraham was a sober man and charity obliges me to think he died a good Christian.

I may first observe that Indians keep no register of their births, but their ages may be determined within a year or two by comparing with them the ages of their English neighbours or some remarkable even which we can ascertain the date of. This is the method? I have used.\nThe Popmunnuck family in first in dignity among my people and affords the most instances of longevity. \nPopmunnuck appeared as first of this tribe in the year 1648 and lived till after 1680. He left at least three sons, but I am able to give the christian names of only Simon and Caleb.\nSimon succeeded Mr. Richard Bourn? as pastor to this Church and lived till 1720 when he was a very old man. Three of his children were living when I came here in 1757 unclear Isaac, Experience? and Josiah. Issac for many years\nx Simon might live till 1727.

Isaac died Nov 1767 having been blind for many years. I saw her spining? once, when her sight could scarcely distinguish the day from night, which was in the year 1759.

A year or two before her death, in the beginning of March, came up a snow Storm attended with a wind, which soon carried away the roof of her wigwam. The old squaw was alone. After the storm on the next day, one of her neighbours being anxious for her health went to see how she had weathered it. She found her bed, on which she lay, covered with a bank of snow, and so deep that there was no appearance of her unclear, which covered her. However she answered from under the snow, with the voice of health, vigor & cheerfulness. - In 1976 died Widow Absolom aged about Ninety.\nI can give only these instances of longevity among my people except it is that of Old Timothy Right, who is in his 86th year, and whom I married, the week before last, to a Squaw under fifty. Timothy is a very unclear man, but hath not been remarkable for his temperance. I heard one of his unclear among the English say \"that Time.

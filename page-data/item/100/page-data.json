My health and spirits and all utterly broke down when I lost my own precious mother and it is only the last few weeks my strength and interest in things are returning.

She intended to apply for that; now we understand she does not intend to teach. It will and be very bad if John Eddie does not get a school, tho we would rather not have him disappointed, He could then finish his school year nicely and be ready for next year. Perhaps he will be in the same school another year, we cannot tell, he probably will be in some school if his health is spared. and it may be a great advantage to him to have passed the examinations there.

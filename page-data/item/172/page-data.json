Madam Paine & Katie are still East.  I think a great deal about your journey home.  It will be very hard for you at best.  I wish I felt able to go East & return with you but I am afraid to.  I am aware you do not think I should run any risk, or of course you would not wish me to do so, for of course you are as anxious to have me live as I am to live & would regard my death as a great calamity to you & the children.  My experience the last time I went East & also my recent experience in riding in the cars makes me dread a journey very much.  Perhaps my fears are groundless.  I fear also that it will do you harm.  Perhaps you can arrange so as to stop at Albany with Mrs. Lee & at Buffalo with Mr. Hartzell's folks in case Lydia returns with you & then by taking the sleeping car from Buffalo you will not get as tired.  If I go with you I shall not think of going through without stopping.  I wish you & I were both well but we are not.  You will get so tired coming out.  David said to-day he would pay 10 dollars towards my expenses East if I would stop in N.Y. City and see some men there for him.  I would not hesitate a moment to go East & return with you did I not so dread the effect of the journey.  For I do want to see Sarah & George in their home & sister Lydia & then I know it would be easier for you even if Lydia did return with you.  I may yet overcome my fears enough to make the attempt.  Mr. Paine said if he was in my place he should not dare undertake it.  It did not rain last night as i wrote you I fear it would.  It has been quite cold to day & is to-night.  I should enjoy so much to have you with me to night to snug close up to me & to give me some of your sweet kisses.  I am daily expecting to hear whether Lydia will return with you & if not then I must make such other arrangements as well best suit you.

There is a great excitement here in war matters.  The governors of the Central West have offered the president 100,000 men for 100 days to man the fortifications & so let the old veterans go forward & take part in the approaching gigantic struggle.  The West has done nobly in this war.  Illinois is a long way in advance in men of all calls made upon her & so is Indiana & yet there is an instantaneous rally & response to this new call.  I feel proud of the West.  Were I able I presume I should have been in the army long ago.  Our family have however furnished its quota.  War is a terrible thing.

He who would calmly sit down & see his wife & children abused, insulted & slain without using every effort in his power to protest & defend them is a cowardly wretch that deserves neither home or wife or children.  So he who can calmly & suprisely see his country destroyed by the hands of traitors & yet make no effort for its safety is not deserving of a country.  I tremble when I look at the approaching struggle & think of the effects of a defeat of our arms.  I think the move being made by the governors of the West is a wise move, for then new men will enable as many veterans to go forward from the fortifications & take part in the struggle & in case of disaster they will serve as a nucleus around which to rally our shattered hosts.

At these two points the armies of the North & South are being massed for a desperate struggle & I am expecting daily to hear of such battles as this ever has not yet seen.  What a terrible affair in the massacre at Ft. Pillow was.  Mr. Leamings brother is the only officer that can survive.  He was shot down after the surrender as the others were but it is thought he will recover.

He says the man who shot him was not over 20 feet from him.  After he was shot he fell down the embankment some 20 feet & there laid unable to move & while lying there rebel men unarmed & who had surrendered & frequently the brains of their victims would be spattered over him & the only way he could get rid of the sight was to shut his eyes.  The fort was garrisoned by Negro troops.  It was attacked by overwhelming forces.  The Negro troops you know have white officers.  After the fort surrendered every officer was shot in cold blood & the negros murdered.  It is strange that such barbarities should have been committed in our own country which we are want to look upon as a civilized land.  Leaming brother has been brought home on a cot in the cars.  Do you get excited over these things down there in Mass.  There is a large war meeting here to-night.  I called at Mr. Hannah's this evening & Mrs. Hannah & Mrs. Bennet were both at the war meeting.  You know I do not go into any large assemblies as it is difficult for me to breath.  I hardly know where to direct this letter to you.  I think I will direct to Warwick & if you are not there they will course forward it.  I am very anxious to have you & the children with me & look forward to your return with pleasant anticipations.

I should be glad to have you & the children with me , very glad indeed but if you think that you &  they will be less likely to be sick with summer complaints in New England than on the farm I want you should remain where you are till cool weather. I shall start for the farm in the morning & shall attend church in Chicago tomorrow & go to Kankakee City to-morrow night. While on the farm I will examine the carpets & put camphor amongst them & try & leave things as safe as I can. I intend to drive the horses up here & turn them out for a couple of months. If possible I want to fix up & put a cover on to our large buggy, for if we live in the country, we need a family carriage very much. It will cost $100 but it will be worth after it is done $225 so carriage makers tell me. It must be painted any way. About painting our house I think when we get down there we can live in the part that Morical's folks are now occupying while the other part is being painted & then we can move into the other part while that part is being painted. We shall of course do our cooking in the Wood House. What do you think of this. I think I can have our buggy fixed this month & next month earn enough to paint our house & get provisions etc. for us to commence living provided Chandler can let you have money enough to get what things you want for yourself & the children & to pay your fare out here. I have borrowed $50 dollars of Mr. Walker & I owed him 100 before. With that I have got I shall be able to pay up all our small debts & shall be owing no body on them but Walker, Erasmus & Myron.

I shall still be owing Erasmus & Myron, but it is quite likely Mr. Walker may want me enough to pay up Myron. Then we shall have a good family carriage & our house painted, but we will have to get along with what stores we have got & other things as they are till we can get money to make them better. I think if we have our painting done when we are there to attend to it then it will look very well with two coats. Write me what you think of all this immediately. I want to know so as to decide about our buggy. It will not cost any more to have you & the children with me down on the farm than it will to have you & them board at Warwick & me board here & perhaps not as much & I am sure I would much prefer having you & them with me providing you all will be as well & prefer being with me. I would like to have Lydia come out with you & go down to our farm providing she would enjoy it, but not otherwise for if she did not like it would not be pleasure for her or us.

We can sell your tickets from here to Chicago & it will be pleasant. You speak about my making a long visit East. I dont now see how I can make much of any visit even if I go East as I cannot lose the time & it will keep me busy after the first of Sept to get our hay, coal, wood rails for corn cribs & fall ploughing done. I suppose I might lose some time & let my job last into Sept & then hire someone to do the work that I should do. Perhaps if I was not absent more than 10 days or two weeks they would not ask me to lose any time. I will think this matter over. There is another objection against my visiting East. I have but one suit of cloth in the world & I have worn them everyday for a long time & they do not look as well as you or I would like to have them. Perhaps they would do. What do you think. If I go East I shall endeavor to start so as to spend the 24th with you & if I go as soon as that will it be necessary to bring your things if I do not stay more than a week or ten days.

He said by giving him 3 weeks notice he could rent for us a comfortable house for from 25 to 30 dollars a month. He saw many come there & derived great benefit, in faith got quite comfortable.

There is no ague in that part of Minnesota they tell me. I know of no place outside of the suburbs of Boston where I would as soon live if I could as in Minneapolis. They raise no applies there. The winter kills the trees. In Wisconsin they have an abundance of apples. Minneapolis market is well supplied with fruit brought from the south. Southern & central Ill. is the fruit garden of the world. Chicago Market is flooded with fruit. Mr. Butt's folks said we could get good board in Minneapolis during the winter for 6 dollars a week & Eddie, Winnie & George, half price & Artie nothing they thought. Board in the winter is much cheaper than in the summer as the pleasure seekers are gone. This would make our board 21 dollars a week besides our washing. They said we could live much cheaper than that if we rented a house. If we should conclude to go there to spend the winter, perhaps we better board till we see how the climate affects us. Board in Asheville N.C. in Getchels institution is 7 dollars a week, but I was told in Chicago we could rent good houses for 10 dollars a month & every thing in the eating line was cheap but it was difficult to get beef. We could live there probably much cheaper than in Minneapolis but could not board as cheap & we should not want to move our things till we know how the climate effected us.

I often think that I have been unkind in not answering the letter which your cousin Mary had the kindness to send me soon after your visit to Boston. But not being an adept in the art of letter-writing, and being deficient in the \"gift of gab\" as it is commonly called, (though I must confess not a very refined term,) I felt very delicate in writing one for fear it would not be exactly to the purpose. But I have laid aside those feelings of restraint in a measure, and have this evening concluded that I would write something if it is not quite so bright; though to tell the truth I suppose I should not have written now if mother had not requested me to. It is a long time since we have seen each other; and I suppose we have changed in appearance, if not in feeling. I hope we may before long have the pleasure of seeing you again in Boston, accompanied by your mother. I have always had a great desire to see her, as she bears I have been told a striking resemblance to my Grandmother.  I have also heard my mother speak of the many pleasant hours she has passed in her society.

Thursday 25th. I have just returned from school having supplied the place of a teacher who is absent. I have as yet obtained no permanent situation. I sometimes get discouraged and think there is no luck for me. I will now inform you why I have written. Last Sunday Mr. Gray informed me that you had received no intelligence from your brother Charles for some time, and that you were very much distressed on his account. I thought if the little information of which I am possessed, (although it is some time since I received it, and you may have heard from him since then,) would relieve your minds any, I would give it you. Last summer Aunt Sarah received letters from her husband, and in one of them he mentioned, that in his travels he had met with your brother at one of the mines. He was then well and seemed in very good spirits. I hope however that you will soon hear from him, and be relieved of your anxiety. Perhaps he may be like a young man whom I met last summer at my Aunt's. He had neglected writing so long, that he thought at last it would be of no use to write. His friends were very anxious about him, and came to the conclusion that he must be dead when suddenly to their great joy and surprise he made his appearance. I hope that it may prove this in your case. We did not know that Charles had gone to California, until he had been there sometime. We were informed of it by some of our friends from the country. When you write, (which I hope you will soon,) you must tell us all about him, and if he is doing well, and how long he intended to be gone. Tell us about the rest of your family, and about yourselves, and every thing that you think we shall take an interest in. I suppose now you would like to hear from your friends down this way. But allow me to say to you before I commence, that I feel more acquainted with you now, than when I commenced writing."},{"pageid":40209,"pagefilename":"6ddc66da5d1b08d0833ed23ca71f88f6.jpg","transcription":"Our family are all in health, and our three boys very active. Grandfather is much better than we ever expected him to be. He is at present with Aunt Esther, in North Chelmsford, but we expect him down here, when the weather is sufficiently warm to enable him to come without any inconvenience. Aunt Sarah resides in Somerville and has a very pleasant place. Uncle Paige returned from California last December, after having been absent nearly two years. He remained at home about two months, and then left again for the \"Golden Region\". I will take the opportunity now of saying to you, lest I should forget it, that I will request Aunt Sarah when she writes, to ask Uncle Paige if he will make inquiries concerning your brother. I have also two cousins at the mines, and I will request the same favor of their friends when they write. Aunt Abby resides in E. Boston. I have not been over there this winter as the going has been so bad. Aunt Harriet still lives in Concord. We hear from them very often as Uncle Stewart comes down every fortnight, and occasionally I receive letters from the girls. Charlotte taught school last summer in Tyngsboro. I believe she did not like as well as she thought she should, and come to the conclusion that she would not attempt teaching again, at least for two or three years. Uncle John lives in the same place that he did when you were here. He has also had an addition to his family, of a girl and boy. The girl is about four years old, and a little beauty I assure you. The boy is about two months old. Uncle Sumner lives in Cambridgeport. I suppose Uncle Samuel lives in Springfield. We have not heard from him since Grandfather was there last summer. I have just returned from lecture, which we have every Thursday evening.

I have been engaged in teaching this summer, and when I returned home at night, I did not feel as though I could lift my hand to do anything. Then again we were very busy in making preparations for Charles to go to California; Charles gone to California! I can almost hear you exclaim. Yes! That little boy you saw when you were here, has gone to seek his fortune in the \"Golden Region\". And if you will believe me, I came very near going; so near that I purchased a travelling dress, and went to Somerville to inform the gentleman with whom I was going that I had decided to accompany him. Aunt Sarah & her two children have gone, and have probably arrived at San. Francisco, before now, as they left on the 21st of June. Now I will explain to you why I thought of going. Last winter when Uncle Paige was at home, he exacted from me a promise, that I would go to California provided Aunt Sarah should go. I thought I was quite safe in making my promise on that condition, as there was no probability that she would ever go. Well! Last May what must he do but send for his family and also for Charles & myself. I was some time in making up my mind, and I finally concluded to go; but I found father rather objected to it, and I thought best to relinquish the idea.

We felt very badly when the time came for parting; Aunt Sarah & Charles kept up very good spirits until, they gave the parting word which brought tears into all eyes. Charles is young to go so far away from home and in the midst of so many temptations, but we do not fear to hurt him as he is a boy of good principles; and then he will be in Aunt Sarah's family, where he will have good influences around him. We received a letter from Aunt Sarah while she was at Panama.  She writes she was seasick but a very little, Anna was sick but a few hours, David not at all, and Charles more so than either. After they had been four days out David had one of his fits, caused I suppose by the excitement. She had a very gentle mule, but Charlie's was rather obstinate, and was determined not to go unless compelled to, and for that reason he did not arrive at the other side of the Isthmus as soon as Aunt did. Now I will give you some account of her journey across the Isthmus, although it will be brief, as she did not give a very minute description, but I suppose we shall have the particulars when Charles writes which I hope will be soon. In the first place her saddle tuned, which let her gently down upon her back in a nice soft place; you must imagine as we did what that \"nice soft place\" was. Her saddle made sure she again mounted, and proceeded  on her journey. She says if you raise your imagination to its highest pitch in regard to crossing the Isthmus, you can scarcely conceive of anything as bad- you go through rivers, over mountains, into mud holes, down steep declivities, and through narrow passes; and I think that is about as much as I should wish to go through. In some parts of her Journey she was obliged to sit astride of the mule as it would have been impossible for her to have travelled otherwise. When I think of the length of time they intend to be gone, (which is five years) I feel sad, for I think of the many changes that may take place, and the probability that we may never meet again on earth; bit it is my earnest prayer that we may have our lives & health spared to us, and that we may again be permitted to enjoy each other's society, as we have in days that are past.

It was Mr. Mansfield, a partner of Uncle Paige's. He came on to visit his family, and Uncle Paige thought it would be an excellent opportunity for Aunt S. to return with him. He felt perfectly sage to trust Aunt S. with him as he had travelled the route several times. Aunt Sarah wrote that he took the best of care of David when he had his fit, and that he had treated them all in a very gentlemanly manner, for which she should always respect him. Charles was very happy and in good spirits, she writes, which is certainly cheering news for us as we expected he would be entirely disheartened, and homesick. I have spoken only of these friends who have left us in the expectation of returning; but there is one who has left us never to return; it is my aged Grandfather. He passed away very gently on Saturday the 12th of June, about 20 minutes past nine in the evening. We had been here but one week when he died. We moved here for the purpose of taking care of him, but he did not want our care long. He was confined to his bed but three days previous to his death, although he ought to have been there several weeks before he was, but he seemed very ambitious to keep up as long as it was possible for him to rise. Uncle John came here and took care of him six weeks, and he was obliged to carry him as if he had been a child. The night before his death, mother & Aunt Sarah watched with him, and he would frequently say though with great effort, \"The Shadow of Death\". We thought he might have been thinking of the passage of Scripture, where it speaks of passing through the dark valley of the shadow of death. The afternoon of his death, he thought he should like some honey. I went into the city to procure some for him, but before I returned with it, he was dying, and not able to take any. I then went directly back for Uncle John; but he was unable to return with me, as his business was such that he could not leave then. When I returned his eyes were closed, but I think he knew I was there, as his hearing returned before he died. While I had gone for Uncle John, he took his last farewell of his friends. When father entered the room he took his hand (being unable to speak) and gave it a firm pressure, he then took the hand of mother, and pressed it to his lips several times; when he took Aunt Sarah's hand he retained it for some time. He looked at each of the children and then closed his eyes upon this world forever. I regret very much that I was not present at the time. But never shall I forget the scene that presented itself to my view, when I entered the room, after my return. There he lay gasping for breath, with the hand of my mother upon his forehead, the hand of Aunt Sarah within his own, and the children standing around, weeping as if their little hearts would break. O! it was such a sad scene indeed, and I cannot refrain from weeping whenever I recall that scene. I knew that he is far happier than he could be here but I should have been pleased, could he have been spared to us a little longer. I cannot realize that he has gone from us forever, it seems as though he must return again. His remains were conveyed to Concord, and deposited in Uncle Stewart's tomb. He looked very natural after he died; Mother thought he resembled Aunt Emily very much, as he lay in his coffin."},{"pageid":40214,"pagefilename":"625bccf787ba0f1a9e187aed25e2a4af.jpg","transcription":"You mentioned in your letter that you had received no new of your brother Charles for a year last Nov. I think if he is living it must be owing to his habit of procrastination that he has not written: for he was very much given to that habit when he boarded with us. He would frequently say he must write home, and that would be the last of it for some time. I hope, however, you have heard from him before this time. I had a cousin leave the 5th of May for California. He was going to meet his brothers who were there, at Bidwell Bar on Feather River. I thought as that was the river on which your brother had been located, they possibly might know something about him, or perhaps be fortunate enough to meet with him; I therefore wrote your brother a letter informing of the anxiety you felt in not hearing from him; and requested my cousin if ever he should meet with him, to deliver it to him. But unfortunately he neglected to take the letter with him. I was sorry it did not go, but I know if ever he should see him, he will let us know when he writes to his friends, Uncle Paige also wrote, that he would endeavor to obtain some information concerning him. You wrote you anticipated visiting is in the fall; I hope you have fully decided to come, and your mother also, and make us a good visit. Now do come won't you? say yes do. Aunt Reed you must certainly say yes for yourself. I should like also to see Mary very much. I should be glad to see all the family, but I suppose as it would not be convenient for all to come I must be contented with seeing a part. Mother too would be very much pleased to see you; and I hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing you soon. I wish you would come now while it is my vacation. It commenced  last Monday and we are to have six weeks. Mother & I went to E. Boston last Friday, and spent the day with Aunt Abby. Hiram obtained a Franklin Medal, at the annual Exhibition. We are now residing at Somerville in Aunt Sarah's house, but it is uncertain whether we shall remain longer than fall or not. We can stay until next April, and I hope matters will be arranged that we can remain until they return from California. I should like to live here always it is so pleasant. I go into the city every day in the cars (which I like very much,) to school. The house is very pleasantly situated, and we have a very extensive view of the neighboring towns. We have quite a little farm too. Father has plated a few vegetables, and we have a cow, and three hens, and in the course of a week or two, we shall have some chickens- O! I enjoy living here very much. There is one thing that I must tell you about; and it is this: Uncle & Aunt Stewart are strong believers in the \"Spiritual Rappings,\" of which I presume you have heard so much. They are quite spiritual of late. I really wish you could hear them talk,- I think you would be amused. I find my sheet is nearly filled, and I must therefore bring my letter to a close. I have written at intervals, and that is the reason why you have not received it sooner after the date. When you scribe, you may direct it if you please, to the care of father, at Mr. G.W. Robinson & Cors. Lock Manufacturing No. 4 Richmond St Boston.  Please excuse bad writing and blunders. Write soon, and have Mary write also. Give my love to all the family, and reserve a share for yourself.

No I am not, but I thought very strange that you had not written me before, and since you have made such a satisfactory apology, I cannot do otherwise than excuse you for your long neglect. I am glad that you & Mary contemplate visiting us so soon and hope that you may not be disappointed. You wish to know who of our friends now reside in the city. Uncle John is the only one and lives in the same place that he did when you were here before. Aunt Abby lives at E. Boston, I am sorry on your account that we are not in the city, as it would be pleasanter for you. I think however that you will like out present place very much.

I wish you would persuade your mother to come with you, for we all wish to see her very much. I do not think there is any thing to prevent her coming as her babes are all large enough to take care of themselves. Now you do your best to have her come. I always had a great desire to see her and  I should think she might gratify me in my wish. All our friends are well except Uncle John.

He died on the passage from Panama to San Francisco. They procured a pine box at Acapulco, and took him to San F.

His death occurred on the 8th of April by the  explosion of the steamer Gazelle on the Columbia Inn, Oregon, at which place he had been about four weeks. This last letter to me were written to me on that steamer and when I read of the explosion I feared here it might be. The next morning I went to school and one of the teachers asked me if we had received letters from California. (Oh! well did I know why she asked) She then told me that the morning paper had mentioned the name of Mr Paige as among the number killed by the explosion. The next day we received letters from Charles and Mr. Gray confirming the sad tidings. They were both too and to write more than a few lines to inform as of his death. Oh! how sad I have been since receiving the mournful intelligence. We are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the next mail so that we may know more of the particulars. Mr. Gray sent me some notices of the death of Mr. Paige so that I might see how highly he was esteemed. The teachers and scholars of the Sunday School in San Fransisco where he had been Superintendent sent him a present of a silver flower vase and salver it reached Willamett on the day of his death. We supposed when the explosion took place that he was on the boat for the purpose of returning to San Fransisco - but Mrs. Steele - a lady from Boston, who has a son in San Francisco, and who was much thought of by Mr. Paige, told me that James wrote her the particulars.

The funeral service was held in the Unitarian Church, Mr. Gray officiating. When they arrived at the grave the children gathered around it, and sung a hymn - they then took a farewell look of their friend, before the grave should hide him from their sight.

Last night when upon reaching home, I found cousin Ann and Sarah. They have come for the purpose of finding some employment in the city. I fear that they will not meet with very good success. They brought with them a letter from cousin Leonora, which afforded me much pleasure- she spoke of her visit to Warwick, and of the pleasant time she passed with her friends there. She said she wish to have me accompany her the next time she went. I should be very happy to do so, and may perhaps give myself that pleasure. I began to speak of my visit, but find that other subjects have taken the place of that one. I had a very pleasant time at uncle Stewart's as I always do, when there. After being there a week I went to N.C. to visit Aunt Esther, found a little daughter there, who arrived on the seventh day of August last. From N.C. I proceeded to Clinton. Enjoyed my visit there very much, found Lottie the same as of old although she was assumed the titles of wife and mother. I presume Leonora told you that Lottie had a babe. He is truly a beautiful looking child. He was born the 10th of last June. And we have also another member added to our family.

It is now time for the scholars to make their appearance which they are beginning to do gradually. You have heard I presume that we are to admit colored children to our schools. I have five of that class, and I think as much of them as I do of my white ones. Brother George wished me to say that he would like to have you come in \"Candy Scrape\" time. He is also quite desirous to hear some of Charles' California stories. Oh, Abby I have just thought of something. Little Sumner Belding was here last Sunday and told about the visit he had made you. He said he told Charles that he looked like me.I could not keep from laughing outright, for only a few weeks before while visiting at Aunt Esther's cousin Roxanna came to see me, and she also said I resembled your brother. I hope Charles will not feel flattered, for if he does he will be sadly disappointed when he comes to see that his cousin Agnes is no handsomer than when he last saw her. Has he written to my brother Charlie yet? If he has not, I hope he will do so soon, for Charles is anxious to hear from him.

My feelings in regard to writing on the Sabbath day are similar to your own. I feel that it is not wrong occasionally to write to absent friends on the holy day, but to take it as many do, as a day expressly for that purpose does not seem right, although it is not actually sinful. I sometimes feel that it makes the heart better to converse with absent friends on that day which is set apart for the service of God. The calmness and quiet of its holy hours are peculiarly favorable to pure and heavenly thoughts while communing  with those who are far away.  And when such heavenly desires and holy expectations find entrance in the heart, is it not doing God service, as much so as to go with the multitude and worship in his holy temple?  felt as I read those beautiful sentiments expressed by you in regard to the different forms and opinions in religion, that my heart was made better by these fine emanations from your own."},{"pageid":40251,"pagefilename":"a1445eb9ed9236fb2a8d51266a31ac9d.jpg","transcription":"I have attended church all day, and I must tell you how much I have enjoyed the services of God's House.

You are probably aware that at this present time, appearances are rather on the \"Shady Side\", but my heart still dwells in the\"Sunny Side,\" although clouds seems to be gathering thickly around me. My hope and trust are strong in Him, who is my Help and Deliverer in time of trouble. I will leave all with Him; for I feel that He will order all things as He thinks best. These are the sincere feelings of the heart. If I must leave this home which is so dear to me, I will endeavor to bear the loss with calmness.\n           You speak of the happy time you had with cousin Nora."},{"pageid":40252,"pagefilename":"93daec0029c843ce4022c9c83bb14a7f.jpg","transcription":"I can imagine the happiness you enjoyed in her society, for I too, have had that pleasure and I sincerely regretted her departure from \"Sunny Side\".

I wrote her last week, but did not scold her as you wished. I could not find it in my heart to reprove her. You will forgive me won't you? for not complying with your request. Yes, I think I may sometimes visit Warwick with her, and perhaps without her as you have so  kindly assured me that you will keep me from all harm.

Frederic is quite tall - large enough to be a young gentleman, but still retains his boyish actions. He is 15 years of age, George 13. How many years is it since we have seen each other. I suppose we have changed very much since then, but I trust the change has not affected our friendship. When we meet I do not think it will be as strangers although we have been so long separated.

You know not with what a grateful heart I received it, and especially that portion of it in which you have given me the privilege of opening my \"whole heart\" to you. You do not know what a blind privilege it would be to me to feel that I had a friend whose sentiments were in harmony with my own and to whom I could go in perfect confidence feeling that the thoughts which I might express would not be looked upon as being peculiar or singular. You have promised to be to me such a friend and from the depths of my heart I thank you for your love and friendship -- believe me they are both reciprocated. Your confession of love has made me very happy for I thought perhaps you did not regard me with as much affection as I did you.

And for those who are seemingly cold, my prayer is that their hearts may be softened and that I may once more enjoy their love and friendship. Oh, how sweet it is to love and be loved. You have thought Abby that there is a congeniality of thought and feeling existing between us. I think there is in many respects, and perhaps we do not differ greatly in any. As you did not write for so long a time, I thought you had withdrawn your friendship on account of the unpleasant occurrence which transpired but a few days previous to your last visit. I did not mention it then to you, because Charles requested me not to, and I promised him that I would not. I would not have you think that that circumstance has changed the feelings of any us towards any of your family. Believe me for I am speaking the truth when I say it, that the same kind, friendly feelings exist for you all as before; and you would be welcomed as sincerely and cordially should you ever visit us again as you were when you first came.

Without boasting let me assure you that these remarks are honest and from the heart. I never allow myself to give expression to any sentiment which I do not feel. Charles also continues to share our friendship and kindness. We ever were his friends, and such we continue to be. My parents never objected to his coming although for awhile he absented himself which made me feel very badly for I feared he would never come again, but he came once while I was away, (and oh how glad I was to hear it) and he has been twice since my return. Ge came last Sunday and spent the day - we had a very pleasant time. Mother and he have real good times talking and laughing together. He often tells her that she is just like his mother. We all have good times. I hope he will often come and that we may have many happy meetings at Sunny-Side. Mother thought perhaps he might be here to day it has been so pleasant. I never feel any happier than when my friends are about me, to whose happiness I can contribute. I would like to have some one of my friends with me all the time so that I could have the pleasure of making them happy. You wish me to be as a sister to your brother, and to cheer him by kind words, looks and deeds. Could you look into my heart you would not need to make such a request.

You express a wish that my feelings may not be changed towards him. Let me tell you Abby that the same kind regard I had for him when he was a member of our family I have now and ever shall have. His manner towards me was ever kind and at times even affectionate. And think you I can ever forget that kindness? No never. During his long absence those pleasant remembrances were often thought of, together with many thoughtless acts of unkindness on my part, which filled my heart with deep regret, and I resolved if ever we should be permitted to meet again, I would atone for my unkindness by kind deeds. I fear your mother will never think of us again as she has, but I hope she will love us a little bit if no more. Tell her that her \"poor boy\" is received as kindly as ever by all of us, and that we all have real good times when he comes. And he will himself confess to the same. My mother and father always thought and spoke well of Charles, and they are still his friends. Do not feel that any unkindness is felt or hard feelings exist towards him - for it is not so, I assure you. Why on that very night that the conversation took place,  before we retired we laughed and were as happy as people could be. Father at the commencement made a remark which made mother and myself feel very badly, and she has talked with him about it. But I think what is said when a person is vexed should be overlooked as they often make remarks which they are sorry for afterwards. You have spoken of your brother as being possessed of a noble heart. I know he has very fine feelings and I appreciate them. I have enjoyed his correspondence very much because his sentiments were very often like my own. I enjoy talking with him very much. I think I understand his nature perfectly. I know he has a kind heart and that is of much value. I have never told my mother that you knew of that affair for she would feel very badly about it. I should not be surprised however if  when she see your mother she would tell her all about it. Yes Abby my mother is going to let me visit Warwick next summer. She says we will all go together as my brother will then be here to go with us, and furthermore she says I may stay longer then she does if I wish to. I was gone three weeks this summer, although at first I did not intend to go away. I visited Clinton in company with Fanny we had a very pleasant time together. You have probably heard of the death of Charlotte's little boy. I spent two weeks with Aunt Esther- she was disappointed that you did not visit her as you first intended. While I was there we all went over to see cousin Roxana. We spent a very pleasant afternoon there  - she too was disappointed in no receiving a visit from you. While at Clinton I heard about Fanny notwithstanding she made you promise not to tell me about it. Are you teaching now? I have 70 scholars ? with an attendance of 65 and 66 which more than fulls mt seats, as I have only 60 of them. Charles and Oscar Wright called at the school one afternoon. I was very glad to see them and then I called with Charlotte only a day or two after to see Charles. Mary owe me a letter which I should be glad to get. Please give my love to her, and say to her I often think of her with pleasure. Mother and I often speak of your visit. You will come again soon will you not? and have your mother come too, for you do not know how I want to see her.

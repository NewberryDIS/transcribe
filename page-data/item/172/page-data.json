Madam Paine & Katie are still East.  I think a great deal about your journey home.  It will be very hard for you at best.  I wish I felt able to go East & return with you but I am afraid to.  I am aware you do not think I should run any risk, or of course you would not wish me to do so, for of course you are as anxious to have me live as I am to live & would regard my death as a great calamity to you & the children.  My experience the last time I went East & also my recent experience in riding in the cars makes me dread a journey very much.  Perhaps my fears are groundless.  I fear also that it will do you harm.  Perhaps you can arrange so as to stop at Albany with Mrs. Lee & at Buffalo with Mr. Hartzell's folks in case Lydia returns with you & then by taking the sleeping car from Buffalo you will not get as tired.  If I go with you I shall not think of going through without stopping.  I wish you & I were both well but we are not.  You will get so tired coming out.  David said to-day he would pay 10 dollars towards my expenses East if I would stop in N.Y. City and see some men there for him.  I would not hesitate a moment to go East & return with you did I not so dread the effect of the journey.  For I do want to see Sarah & George in their home & sister Lydia & then I know it would be easier for you even if Lydia did return with you.  I may yet overcome my fears enough to make the attempt.  Mr. Paine said if he was in my place he should not dare undertake it.  It did not rain last night as i wrote you I fear it would.  It has been quite cold to day & is to-night.  I should enjoy so much to have you with me to night to snug close up to me & to give me some of your sweet kisses.  I am daily expecting to hear whether Lydia will return with you & if not then I must make such other arrangements as well best suit you.

There is a great excitement here in war matters.  The governors of the Central West have offered the president 100,000 men for 100 days to man the fortifications & so let the old veterans go forward & take part in the approaching gigantic struggle.  The West has done nobly in this war.  Illinois is a long way in advance in men of all calls made upon her & so is Indiana & yet there is an instantaneous rally & response to this new call.  I feel proud of the West.  Were I able I presume I should have been in the army long ago.  Our family have however furnished its quota.  War is a terrible thing.

So he who can calmly & suprisely see his country destroyed by the hands of traitors & yet make no effort for its safety is not deserving of a country.  I tremble when I look at the approaching struggle & think of the effects of a defeat of our arms.  I think the move being made by the governors of the West is a wise move, for then new men will enable as many veterans to go forward from the fortifications & take part in the struggle & in case of disaster they will serve as a nucleus around which to rally our shattered hosts.

What a terrible affair in the massacre at Ft. Pillow was.  Mr. Leamings brother is the only officer that can survive.

He says the man who shot him was not over 20 feet from him.  After he was shot he fell down the embankment some 20 feet & there laid unable to move & while lying there rebel men unarmed & who had surrendered & frequently the brains of their victims would be spattered over him & the only way he could get rid of the sight was to shut his eyes.  The fort was garrisoned by Negro troops.  It was attacked by overwhelming forces.  The Negro troops you know have white officers.  After the fort surrendered every officer was shot in cold blood & the negros murdered.  It is strange that such barbarities should have been committed in our own country which we are want to look upon as a civilized land.  Leaming brother has been brought home on a cot in the cars.  Do you get excited over these things down there in Mass.  There is a large war meeting here to-night.  I called at Mr. Hannah's this evening & Mrs. Hannah & Mrs. Bennet were both at the war meeting.  You know I do not go into any large assemblies as it is difficult for me to breath.  I hardly know where to direct this letter to you.

I dont now see how I can make much of any visit even if I go East as I cannot lose the time & it will keep me busy after the first of Sept to get our hay, coal, wood rails for corn cribs & fall ploughing done.

Perhaps if I was not absent more than 10 days or two weeks they would not ask me to lose any time. I will think this matter over. There is another objection against my visiting East.

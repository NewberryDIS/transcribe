Kearney.  First came the killing of the hunting party out from Ft. Reno, then the massacre of the mail party from here to Phil. Kearney and since that the road has been infested with stealing bands of Indians to such an extent that nothing but the utmost vigilence could could prevent the stealing of stock.\n    On last Sunday morning, I received the news from xxxxx Fort Sedgwick or rather from Ft. Mitchell that Indians were on the road below and that a train of Mr. Korstz had lost all its animals.  In an hour or two after I started Capt. Ball with his company in pursuit.  Capt.

Augur\nCommanding Department\nDear General\nYours of yesterday is duly received.  Your remarks about the case of the wounded boy  are perfectly true and conclusive.  In mentioning that Dr. Crampton had been at all times ready and willing to attend the wounded lad, my only idea was to exonerate him of any suspicion of indifference in the case, and I did not think any further in the matter.  Your note shows me that my mention of Dr. C. was quite unnecessary, and I acknowledge it cheerfully.\n\n                                              Very Respectfully\n                                                Your friend and Servant\n                                                       R. de Trobriand"},{"pageid":69062,"pagefilename":"72d72a0248fd123276cdd71e535cf664.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":69063,"pagefilename":"cd73f71df472777031a85c8ff5bb3967.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":69064,"pagefilename":"8cbb39e0d11473187e8d1af38ac17e82.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":69065,"pagefilename":"5a6390b03d2262cb0cd39519aabfa0ba.jpg","transcription":""},{"pageid":69066,"pagefilename":"b240d714b6a331e917b7938710c341b1.jpg","transcription":"2\nand travled all over the Country looking for both the Secretary of War is Satisfied that I had men and horse but he Says I must Show that I was emploied by you and that I might onley be working for the Reward offered I posted up for government the first bills ever printed offering a Reward I allways come to you and aney time you Sed go and do aneything I don't my claime for this is but three hundred dollars I was note over three weeks and five men and horses I paid all Expences the days I got the gun boat baker \nboat baker got Booth So I did not go in it but I had the men in the Street all night awaiting orders and the news came that baker had got him if you remember I was hard at work at that time I comenced the next day after the President was kiled if you recolect you went down about 9 oclock in the morning and brought the Presadent up from tenth Street in a waggon you give me orders to take men and do all i could I did as you told me to but all the orders for horses has not your name to them but you gave orders and took them to the partis then thay give me orders to Quartermasters of corce your name is not an my last orders and the Secatary Says he will wite you he Says that you think I mad a good deal of money if it was my dying word I Say that I Lost Mosby owes me over a thousand dollars his men owe me Lots of tobaco I was in thare power I had to trust them when unley made the laide on Washington thay Stole Everything I had I then give up my teame and if you recolect when Genl Sheridan made for the valley you Sent for me to come to your office you told me if I would take the Team and go oute you would se that\nI was paid I was Loosen then I took my wife and Comenced agan now I mad but ninteen trips and I\nCould not make a Large amount of money but I did actuley Looose money but if Mosby and his men had of paid me I should made maby two thousand dollars but I did not get the tobaco In and if Mosby had got me oute agan he would of hung me all he wanted was the Large lot of goods he ordered and to hand me but I did not go not go anney more the Jews put in affadavits that I decived them that thay thought I was a Settler did thay think our Soldiers wore gray uniforms and rebbell buttons Shoo Fly they Say I asked for bribes if I had of  don that I ges you would of put me in old capitol thay I robed if I had don the Leas thing roung would not Mosley or his men hung me in a Second what a foolish Letter this of Riddles is but he has killed my Claime in the Sennate I have no friend to help me aboute a hundred Jews have him to the Committee I will now ask and pray that you will wright the facts and youse your influance for me to get a Settlement with the Secretary of War I am poor I hav a little farm in Ellington NY five hundred miles from Washington I hav bin hear Six times this winter and Spring I Shall go home tomorrow if cost me about a hundred dollars every time I come I had to Sell two cows to get the money to come hear this time and my farm my little home will be Sold in September to pay the mortgage if I do not get aney money hear I think that government had aught to Sustain me and to pay me that bribe money or its Equivilent and never let the Jews hav it It has cost me every cent if I got it for Expencis I paid all the Expences of the trails getting wittnesses of Millatory Commission and traveling Expencis my family expencis in Washington don all the work and paid oute thousands of dollars"},{"pageid":69067,"pagefilename":"cc19f1a5c3abf5c5fabb6e35f1783e9f.jpg","transcription":"and it is not a Shame that after all the chances of Life all the abuce I have suffered and the nights I have traveled with my wife in the Rebbell Lines Expecting any day to be Shot and all this to aide the government and now after I have Exausted the last dollar and today my familey is Suffering for the money paide out for the interest of the government and I am now over fifty years old am I to become a begger for my Loyalty this is hard Cant you make a statement to Secretary of War that he can have some grounds which he can make a Settlement with me fix the amount for all I will be Satisfied with your Report to tak what you Say.

Genl. C. C. Augur,\nComdg: Dept. Platte\nOmaha\nGeneral,\n\n              For the last few weeks, the Indians have made rather lively times along the whole  route from Fort Sedgwick & Fort Phil. Kearney.  First came the killing of the hunting party out from Ft. Reno, then the massacre of the mail party from here to Phil. Kearney and since that the road has been infested with stealing bands of Indians to such an extent that nothing but the utmost vigilence could could prevent the stealing of stock.\n    On last Sunday morning, I received the news from xxxxx Fort Sedgwick or rather from Ft. Mitchell that Indians were on the road below and that a train of Mr. Korstz had lost all its animals.  In an hour or two after I started Capt. Ball with his company in pursuit.  Capt. B. had to swim the Platte and go fifty miles before he could get to the trail, but he followed it quite a long"},{"pageid":68965,"pagefilename":"de42de0946ea0a5f42b1fd504f834a9b.jpg","transcription":"distance beyond the White river before giving up all hopes of overtaking them.

Green with all the remaining serviceable horses at the Post was sent after the.  I have no news from him as yet but I have heard that the friendly Indians near here have been stripped of nearly all their horses.\n    In the midst of these troubles the desertion [underline] fever broke out in the Command. Several small parties went off and as it was all important that this mania for desertion should be checked I sent several parties with Commissioned officers in pursuit.  Two of these parties have been successful in bringing back a port of the men.  In this connection I will state that I have made repeated efforts to have a General Court Martial ordered here for the trial of our General prisoners without success.

In the battle I had the extreme left of our position, & every man of my Brigade went into action & as far as I saw, did his utmost, The 6th Maine Battery, Capt. Robertson, was the only Artillery I had & was the first part of my brigade to open, & well he played his part.  I am mistaken, it was second. The first was Capt. Pitcher's battalion of 8th & 12th regular infantry (6 companies) which was thrown forward in front of the brigade as skirmishers. Their part I have occasion to know excited the admiration of the enemy, who inquired if they were not regulars, as they had \"never seen such skirmishing.\" They were out during  the whole battle &  penetrated even to the enemy's position, & annoyed them so as to turn the alteration of his guns away from more distant firing, with shot & shell & cause them to waste canisters upon the ground of the skirmishers.

I have heard of a few slight wounds happening here. But the cannonade ceased & I then immediately moved forward with the right wing, deeming the left had better remain where it was because we were so much out flanked by the enemy that I expected a charge on the flank, while thus advancing with the right wing, I received by Capt. Cutting A.D.C. an order from Gen. Augur to \"go forward\" accompanied by a message from the Gen. that he would send \"some artillery to sustain the left.\"  I advanced with the right wing till in short range of the enemy and had opened when a second Aid de Camp from Gen. Augur communicated the General's order for me to advance my \"whole\" force.

Tenatt was mortally wounded encouraging the soldiers with his cheerful manner & sometime after that Lt. Haskell by my side pointed to his wound & told me he thought he could not sit his horse much longer which was evident from his apperance. Captain Green being the only other mounted person present besides myself I ordered him to hold Haskell on his horse & take him to the rear. I was then the  only mounted officer present. It was getting quite dusky & was necessary that I should have some communication with the rest of the Army. I told the nearest field officer Maj. Gray that I would be absent for that purpose a moment & only a moment that I would instantly return & gave the new orders which were evidently necessary.  I galloped to the right & rear & just as I expected to issue from the cornfield into open ground where I should see Gen.

He looked into my holsters & said \"Gen. I will take your pistols & your glass.\" I then held away my coat from the handles of my sword when he asked me for it & I said \"there it is you can take it\". He drew it out & we rode a quarter of a mile or more when he presented me to Gen. Hill who asked him who he was; he said Major        of       regt.

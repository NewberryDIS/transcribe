Kearney.  First came the killing of the hunting party out from Ft. Reno, then the massacre of the mail party from here to Phil. Kearney and since that the road has been infested with stealing bands of Indians to such an extent that nothing but the utmost vigilence could could prevent the stealing of stock.\n    On last Sunday morning, I received the news from xxxxx Fort Sedgwick or rather from Ft. Mitchell that Indians were on the road below and that a train of Mr. Korstz had lost all its animals.  In an hour or two after I started Capt. Ball with his company in pursuit.  Capt. B. had to swim the Platte and go fifty miles before he could get to the trail, but he followed it quite a long"},{"pageid":68965,"pagefilename":"de42de0946ea0a5f42b1fd504f834a9b.jpg","transcription":"distance beyond the White river before giving up all hopes of overtaking them.  Capt. Ball thinks the Indians have at least ninety- miles the start of him, and he considered it perfectly useless to pursue any further.  He returned late yesterday.\n\n    Yesterday morning I heard of a party of seventy Indians some fifteen miles above here, and Col. Green with all the remaining serviceable horses at the Post was sent after the.  I have no news from him as yet but I have heard that the friendly Indians near here have been stripped of nearly all their horses.\n    In the midst of these troubles the desertion [underline] fever broke out in the Command. Several small parties went off and as it was all important that this mania for desertion should be checked I sent several parties with Commissioned officers in pursuit.  Two of these parties have been successful in bringing back a port of the men.  In this connection I will state that I have made repeated efforts to have a General Court Martial ordered here for the trial of our General prisoners without success.

For some unaccountable cause the road heretofore has passed beyond Bridgers Ferry, up the Platte through the bad lands to near the mouth of Gap Creek before turning northward.  Now I am almost certain that the new road which I have ordered opened direct from the Ferry to Reno, will be a great deal better and some thirty to thirty-five miles shorter.  As I stated in my telegram of a day or two since, would not the garrison of Fort Casper be of some service then, at or near the Ferry an on the main road to Montana?   I know that Gen.

Dewers did not explain the direct road from Bridger's Ferry to Reno.  He was directed to return that way and Nick Janiss, a good guide was sent up to guide the party back.  Capt. Dewers states that he did start back that way but owing to loss of a food portion of his mules and the difficulty of breaking the road with weak teams he was obliged to return to the old road after coming a few miles on the new one.\n         The report concerning the loss of Dewer's mules will be prepared by Sun.  I didn't think Even will get caught that way.  He has good hobbles for all his animals and I procured for him about a third of a mile of telegraph wire to be used in wiring up the Camp.  If he can stretch it so as to catch and capsize a few of the Indians, the Medicine will be something that will make them very careful of running about our Camps.\n                                                         You probably"},{"pageid":68974,"pagefilename":"8610b204f92eb660f8a9a19cd6599ca8.jpg","transcription":"saw that the going up to Phil.

It is rather a curious condition of affairs attempted.

They are made very comfortable here and I do everyting they require to be done for them.  They appear to be very remarkable men, and they may be able to accomplish some good.

It mattered not that they were all precisely alike in form; we gave them different names, and it was wonderful to see the changes so produced in their appearance. The red and white strawberries also, that abounded there, afforded us no small sources of pleasure. Many is the overflowing handful I have plucked of them, and many the sweet mouthful I have eaten.

The driver very kindly assisted me to mount.  The ends of the logs formed the steps by which I ascended, and though they were not so graceful or easy of ascent as might be, they answered my purpose very well.  I was soon as comfortably seated on the uncouth looking logs, with a horse blanket cushion, as if I were on a velvet cushioned seat in a costly carriage.  I sat with my side towards the horses heads, and my face turned to the village before us.  Everything seemed anxious to render happiness.  Perhaps this appeared so to me, because I was just in the mood to be pleased.  But aside from my feelings the sight was truly pleasing.  Only the tops of the village houses could be seen from whose chimneys the smoke went up, curling gently through the air.  The snow fell so softly, that instead of dazzling or bewildering the sight it lent a beauty to the air through which we looked, making what was always admired appear still more lovely and over that, which like the rough rail fences, was really homely, it threw a mantle so pure and graceful, that we could not but call it beautiful.  Lightly and merrily it danced around the hills and forest beyond the village dusting them over with white.  My favorite hill was in its prime. Its form, the same as ever, arose like a pyramid, higher than any other eminence around, and its crowning tree still stood erect upon the top.

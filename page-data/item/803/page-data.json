On the night of the 11th Co. D was on picket and it was a dark wet cold night. At 12 o clock on the night of the 12th we were routed up to go to Corinth via of Rienzi and guard through a long train and some prisoners, we arived at Rienzi in the evening of the 13th and staid all night. The next day (14th) we arived at Corinth and we were right glad to see our quinine Brigade and new recruits after having been away from them so long. We have settled down here and formed a regular camp as if we were going to remain here sevral days and rest. . There is no crops within six miles and the earth is thrown up into piles and riges to protect men from bullets and the timber is filled to prevent charges. ....... Capt Reynolds received a letter making inquiries about us. After this I won't give you so much trouble for if I have no chance to write a letter I will write you a line with a pencil. Wm. and I are all right and kicking. The secesh haven't got us and won't be likely to as long as we have good horses. . Our horses was valued at the highest figure or one-hundred dollars each. I don't know when Uncle Sam is going to pay us for them, he already has his mark on them. We wanto hear from you as soon as possible. I must bring this lengthy letter to a close and go and wash a shirt for I haven't washed one these six weeks past, but hoping to hear from you often. I remain your affectionate brother, Chas. W. Gallentine. P. S.

After I wrote you last we settled down at Corinth and nothing of importance transpired while we remained there. We drilled with our new recruits, stood picket went forageing etc. On the 29th of Oct. we received marching orders and on the 30th we started, got into Corinth and stood there all day. While there I saw Steven Thurman he was not very well. In the evening we traveled sevral miles out of Corinth and stoped. On the 31st we marched all day. Nov. 1st we reached this place in the evening and camped. We came pretty nigh starving to death on this last march. During the three days we were out I subsisted on three biscuits or rather the first day I had three biscuits and after that nothing. You don't appreciate what a favor it is to have plenty to eat. I don't know of any regiment that gets starved as often as we do. While I write an order comes for us to be ready to march in the morning at day light with five days rations and 250 rounds of cartriges. There is going to be a movement made from Corinth and this place perhaps on Holly-springs. The 103ed Ill. infantry and sevral other regiments arived here to day. The 103 is from Fulton Co.

William and I are both well and neither of have been taken prisoner or hurt. About the first of December Gen. Grants Army moved southward from this place the Cav. taking the lead but I cannot enter into the details of the skirmishes and incidents that transpired on the way. We passed through Holly Springs, Oxford and other towns on to Coffeeville. After we passed Oxford we picked up a great many prisoners some fifteen hundred in number. On the third of Dec. our reg. and the 2nd Iowa had a skirmish with the rebels at Springdale. There was ten rebels wounded and two men of our reg. wounded. The next day Dec. 4th the 2nd Iowa and our reg had another little fight at Watervaley. Companies A, G and D were dismounted and put in the bush the remainder of the reg. and the 2nd Iowa remained mounted. The rebel cav. made a desperate attempt to check us and without halting charged upon us but they charged out again full as fast. They left nine dead on the ground and we took near one hundred prisoners. I don't know how many they had wounded. We had one man killed and sevral wounded. John Wine of our Company was wounded in the calf of the leg.

At that time our infantry and artilery was a long way behind having been detained at the Tallahtchie where the rebels burned the bridge. The rebels had powerful fortifications at the crossing of the Tallahatchie but they abandoned them after making just stand enough to stop our advance of cavalry. The Tallah is about eighteen miles from Holly springs and sixteen miles from Oxford. On the 5th of Dec. the 7 Kansas, 3rd Mich., 5th Ohio, 2nd Iowa, 7 Ills. Cav. regs. advanced from Watervalley towards Coffeeville the mud being tremendous deep. The rest of the Coffeeville affair you know as well as I do. The rebels was too strong for us. Our advance was driving in their pickets when suddenly they formed themselves on a long line of rebel infantry which arose and poured in a volley. We continued to skirmish with them awhile when all at one the commenced to advance on the double quick and folowed us four miles or until after dark. Our cav. was formed in line after line but the rebels outflanked us farther than we could see so that ever line we formed gave way after delivering one tremendous round. Some of our regs. was armed with revolving rifles which shoot five times without reloading and when they delivered their fire it was awful to hear. I don't know how many was killed on either side. We fell back to Watervaley and at midnight just after we had gone to bed we were routed up (it was raining hard) and went back sevral miles farther. There was two men of our Company wounded at Coffeeville and the Captain and thirteen men was taken prisnors. I have just received a letter from George E. Edrington of Galesburg who was taken at Coffeeville he is at home and he sends me the power of attorney so that I may draw his pay if we are paid before he returns.

We took a few pris and eigh secesh wagons eigh six mule teams 125 new tents that had never been streched sevral boxes of canteens a large quantity of corn meal two casks of whiskey etc. etc. We had to burn the things as the roads was so bad we could not get away with them. As we came back through Pontotock the rear guard of a large force of rebels was just leaving town. The force consisted of Cav. and mounted Infantry. It was the same force that made the decent on Holly Springs. Their rear guard formed in line to receive us but they were as many as five to one of us so we let them be and they dident trouble us. We then took another trip to Coffeeville we found but few rebels that time. We took sevral other scouts in truth we have been in camp but very little for two month. When our army commenced falling back the Cav. started the other way and made some demonstrations. In comeing back the 2nd Iowa and 7th Ill. had to swim the Tippa river a rapid stream with ugly banks.

What made him sign Mothers name Mary Jones? Did he catch any fish? Is he not trying to catch a shad? I understand that there is censiderable among the people of Ills. about the emansipation of slaves.

I have just received your welcome letter of Feb. 18th so you see it has been detained a long time by the mail which will excuse any apparent negligence on my part in not answering it sooner... The mails has been very irregular lately on account of the railroads having been broken in various places in this section by the unremitting constancy of the rains and consequent high water: but of course your letter would come through or burst its envelope and through it did come brim full of news and humor.

I dident consider it necessary for me to keep the valentine in order to show my respect for the sender so I sent it to another person that they too might have an insight into the mystiries of and the realities of life.

There has been three Cav. reg.s camped here during the winter and there has been a battalion more or less out nearly all the time notwithstanding the bad weather and muddy roads. The first battalion of this regiment, (that is companies A, G, D &amp; K) were out on a two days scout. We took a circle around pretty nigh to Hollysprings and captured two secesh officers and one that wasent an officer but who made it his especial business to skulk about and pop over unlucky cotton buyers and rob them, he may be summarily dealt with. There is a great activity at present in the removal of infantry from this place and other points along this railroad line. They were going all last night and still continue to go. While I write I can hear iron horses running, wheezing and whistling and now and then a train loaded with soldiers rattles off as if the old scratch was after it. The troops are going by rail to Memphis but I don't know where they go from there. It is my opinion that every thing is in readiness at Vicksburge for the grand assault and that all the available troops are being drawn from the various points to participate. Whether there will be any use for cavalry at that place or if there is whether or not this regiment will be called upon I cannot say. This place may be entirely abandoned and it may not. The ways of those in command are inscrutable and past finding out. I have quit makeing conjectures as to the probable termination of the war but we are certainly nearer the end than when we first began. I suppose the copperheads in Illinois would rejoice to hear of our being defeated at Vicksburg but there will be a day of reckoning for those vill traitors. But I am not going to comment upon their evil doings words don't reach their case.

This company, with others in all about 150 men, has been on one little scout of three days and went pretty nigh around Memphis at the distance of seventeen miles more or less. We crossed some pretty ugly streams, one that we had to ferry, a recent rain having caused the creeks to get on a high. Every thing was quiet in this vicinity, we only saw one rebel during the scout. We saw where four gurrillas had stopped five days loaded with cotton within eight miles of Memphis. They burned the cotton and took the mules with them. Government had nothing to do with the affair... Citizens suffer more from the gurrillas than uncle sam... The prospects are very favorable at present, for a speedy termination of the war.

They had lost much valuable ground with many thousand men but the draft in the north had been openly resisted and on that fact the rebels formed their hopes of a southern Confedracy.

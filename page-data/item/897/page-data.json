Grant\n\n          Comd 13th Army Corps, Oxford\n\nDear General.\n\n          Col. Grierson is about to start for Helena with your despatches, and I also toward Memphis.  When he returns, he will report to you in person.\n          Col. Grierson has been with me all summer, and I have repeatedly written to you, and spoken in his praise.  He is the best Cavalry Officer I have yet had.  I commend him specifically to your consideration.  He has already had assigned to him a Brigade, but the Cavalry has been so busy, that he has not yet had his command.  I ask for him, anything you can do for his benefit and the good of the service.  I know that you will soon appreciate his merits\n\n                                                                                                                                          Yours Truly\n                                                                                                                                           W.T.

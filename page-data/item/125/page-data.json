Fear you are thinking altogether too much of others and too little of yourself, as you always do. Wish you could have a better\nchance to rest. If you could be here while father is gone I should be glad. Hope Father will have a good pleasant time. You ought to try to rest while he is gone. I have enjoyed having the girls with me. Am sorry Mary's health is no better. Hope she will yet find that it has been a benefit to her. We have some anxiety about her going home alone. Hope she will be stronger in two or three weeks and then she will be likely to have no difficulty. We are all in normal health. The children are enjoying the pleasant weather very much. Wish we could all come out and see you this Summer. Perhaps we may another year if spared. I want to see you. Fear you are wearing yourself out too fast. We had a letter from Sarah Sharis? last week.

Hampton\nMay 13, 1858?\nDear Mother, Your kind letter containing $15 was rec'd last Saturday. Pa was very kind to send so much. I was very glad to get it though. We have had a great time this week starting home. Packed Monday, was too tired to go Tuesday. Wednesday it rained. E. was not willing for me to start today, and so it is. I do want to see you Ma, so much. I fear from your letter that you are quite feeble. We feel quite anxious about you and Sarah.\nI have not been very strong of late. E. think that if I wait a week or so longer I shall be better able to endure the journey. Your letter"},{"pageid":36820,"pagefilename":"b1e70e9ca77bed713ce968dc64249cdb.jpg","transcription":"would have rec'd a more prompt reply, had we not had such a time about starting that we hardly knew what to write. I think when I go, I shall go through Rutland, as that is the most quiet route. I shall thus pass through Saratoga. Shall stop in Rutland over night, and reach Utica I think early in the afternoon of the next day. Father will be going next week and I shall thus lose seeing him before he starts. It cost me quite a struggle to bring my mind to this, but perhaps it is best so. I do not think my heath is quite as good as when we came out, but hope after getting home and resting that I may realize that the visit has been beneficial.\nElizabeth would like much to go home with me and make us a good long visit but they have"}],"title":"Mary Holywell Everett letters, 1850-1891"}}}

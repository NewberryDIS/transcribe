I have had my sateen dress made at least it is nearly finished. Skirt with kilt plaits & basque with redingote back, like my grey dress when it was new. I think I shall like it very much. I am also having my [?] veiling dress made over. that is the skirt which will be plain the waist  not altered unless there be ruffles at the top of the sleeves. There will be enough pieces to make a basque so I rather think I will have it done, & then I will be comfortable for the summer.

We have had a great time this week starting home. Packed Monday, was too tired to go Tuesday. Wednesday it rained. E. was not willing for me to start today, and so it is. I do want to see you Ma, so much. I fear from your letter that you are quite feeble. We feel quite anxious about you and Sarah.\nI have not been very strong of late.

It cost me quite a struggle to bring my mind to this, but perhaps it is best so. I do not think my heath is quite as good as when we came out, but hope after getting home and resting that I may realize that the visit has been beneficial.\nElizabeth would like much to go home with me and make us a good long visit but they have"}],"title":"Mary Holywell Everett letters, 1850-1891"}}}

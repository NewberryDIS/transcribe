There is quite a difference between the customs & manners of the people here & in New England, also in the appearance of the towns. Many Eastern people get the idea that every thing western must necessarily be wrong & anything that is done differently from what they are accustomed to, is perfectly ridiculous. They look at things through the colored lens of prejudice & of course see nothing as it really exists. I often hear people say \"they don't do so East\" & repeat it so often that it is not only annoying but positively disgusting. The phrase \"they don't so so East\" has become a bye word here. I met a lady in the cars a few days since who was putting on airs, & having over the above phrase frequently. She run down everything.  The Society, the people, & the country came in for a share of her slang. Doubtless she found things different from what they are East, but at the same time as the west was now her home how foolish it was in her to try & quarrel with it, & to make Such remarks as to make the people with whom She associates her enemies.

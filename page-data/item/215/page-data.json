But dear me, she has grown so, and looks like a young lady. We talked and talked about everybody and everything; I brought her an amethyst ring like mine, with which she was most highly delighted.

The affair is to be refered to the supreme court in September. Sister does not like it at all, for she thinks it will not be doing as Papa would have wished for he did not know anything about the law, and if he had he would have made his will differently; his main idea and object was to keep the property so as it would go down undivided to his grand children, and if Mama should choose to will away to somebody else the three or four hundred thousand dollars of which she will get possession, why then poor Papa's money for which he toiled so hard will be disposed of in a different way from that which he intended and it seems a sacrilige even to think of it. If Papa had only left us five hundred a year we would never have thought of saying a word, and when Mamma had ten thousand a year it does not seem as if she would have said or done anything.

I don't know anything about my great-grand Mother & my great-grand children if I ever have any, will know equally little about me; it makes one feel what a mere atom one is in the Universe.

Meredith had previously told me forty times that he would \"do anything in the world for me\", & of course I pooh! poohed the idea.

She must be one of those wonderful people who can bear physical pain with a kind of Spartan firmness, & it is a faculty that I admire beyond anything else. Marie is very handsome, in a peculiar style. A classicaly shaped head, (always a great beauty,) around which her hair is arranged in a complicated but artistic manner. Large black eyes, & good but rather heavily moulded features; the outlines of her face, neck, arms, & bust are really splendid; & she looked more \n(232  like an old picture of a French woman of the last century, than anything else. But it is alltogether rather a coarse \"type\", & she is too mature for a girl of seventeen. - Mrs Zborouska is a Southern woman by birth, with delicate features & black hair. A woman who can make herself immensely agreeable when she chooses, & yet who one feels is never quite sincere. A person such as you read of in novels, mysterious & irritating, & yet one that piques curiosity; but I am quite sure I never would trust her. Annie was the same as ever, if changed in anyway rather toned down & subdued. She has one of those characters which is entirely moulded by circumstances & the people she is thrown with -  If she were to live with pious people she would be pious, & if she lived with fast people she would be fast."},{"pageid":48463,"pagefilename":"585457eca66185c6eaa82ad366827917.jpg","transcription":"I cant understand such people they have no stamina whatever, + are as unfit to take care of themselves as so many babies.

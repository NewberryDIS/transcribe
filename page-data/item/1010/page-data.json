There seems to be a growing disposition on the part of many of the Indians to receive medical treatment from the Agency Physician in preference to their own medicine men, often coming one hundred miles to the Agency for such treatment.  In support of this, the Agency Physician, in his sanitary report of June, says \"Judging from the frequent number of call I have in the same bands of families, besides cases coming from a great distance I am led to believe that the Navajos are seeing the folly of the native manner of treating the sick, and are more than anxious to receive rational treatment in serious cases, many of the old and inform persons and those suffering with chronic complaints express a desire that I should treat them, but owing to the great distance they live from the Agency are unable to come regularly for medicine; they frequently say if I could furnish them a place to stay and something to eat they would remain"},{"pageid":66783,"pagefilename":"659a6638e9e36c76eebfb51cfd8a1434.jpg","transcription":"4.\nfor treatment, a thing I cannot do unless there were hospital accommodations.\n\n    During the year the Agency Physicain has treated 867 persons.\n\nStock\nLike the white citizen of New Mexico and Arizona, the principal pursuit of the Navajo is stock raising.

In this many of them moved out of the reservation, especially on the East and South sides, but returned again in the Spring.

Instead of prosecuting this work under the supervision of superintendents as heretofore, which has not been satisfactory, I think the best method would be by contract under bond for faithful performance.  Some of the dams constructed last year have washed out, in fact, it would be difficult to make a dam in this country to withstand the terrible floods during the rainy season, without a great outlay of expense: for this reason the construction of dams, except for temporary use, should be abandoned and the work directed to reservoirs ditches and the development of Springs."},{"pageid":66787,"pagefilename":"d935419315de984861f4e308b94e7ec2.jpg","transcription":"8.\nHouses.\nThe Indians are still possessed with a desire mentioned in my last annual report to build better houses of stone and logs, and to live more like Americans, with permanent homes.

This proposition I deem absurd and impracticable, with the present reservation limits there is sufficient territory to accomodate the entire tribe for years to come.  I am heartily in accord with the polity of the Indian office encouraging the Indians to take up land under the law who desire to remain out of the reservation.

In such cases the Agent always renders all aid that lies in his power to assist in the recovery of lost stock, but he finds in many instances where the Navajos are charged with stealing horses the animals have only strayed from the owner.

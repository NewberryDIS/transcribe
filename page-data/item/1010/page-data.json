The trail was lost near the north fork of Red River about a hundred miles from this Post. by being merged into and obliterated by the trails of large herds of Buffalo. Captain Walsh had with him Lieuts Myrick, Harmon and Myers, and I am satisfied that every effort was made to recapture the mules; the command travelled a distance of 80 miles within the first twentyfour (24) hours. some of the Wichitas deserted the command before they arrived at the North fork and the balance were of little service after they struck the Buffalo.

Instead of prosecuting this work under the supervision of superintendents as heretofore, which has not been satisfactory, I think the best method would be by contract under bond for faithful performance.  Some of the dams constructed last year have washed out, in fact, it would be difficult to make a dam in this country to withstand the terrible floods during the rainy season, without a great outlay of expense: for this reason the construction of dams, except for temporary use, should be abandoned and the work directed to reservoirs ditches and the development of Springs."},{"pageid":66787,"pagefilename":"d935419315de984861f4e308b94e7ec2.jpg","transcription":"8.\nHouses.\nThe Indians are still possessed with a desire mentioned in my last annual report to build better houses of stone and logs, and to live more like Americans, with permanent homes.

The corn raised on the school garden this year was planted that way as an experiment and without irrigation was the best corn grown on the entire reserve, from this experience I am led to believe that very fair corn can be raised in many parts of the reservation without the use of water.

The Indian name is Muscogee.* The Creeks come from the west. They have a tradition among them that there are in the fork of Red River west of the MiSsiSsippi, two mounds of earth; that at this place the CuSsetuhs, Cowetuhs, and Chickasaws, found themselves; that being distreSsed by wars with red people, they croSsed the MiSsiSsippi; directing their course eastwardly they croSsed the falls of Tal,lapoo,sa above Took,au,bat,che, settled below the falls of Chatto,ho,che and spread out from theire to Ocmulgee, O,co,nee, Savannah and down on the Sea-coast towards Charlestown.

After the flesh is devoured, the bones are carefully collected, and either burnt or thrown into a stream of water.\nThe Feast of Invitation is prepared with less ceremony.  On this occasion a large quantity of food is generally prepared - a whole deer; and an invitation given to all the men of the band to participate. - The food is distributed amongst them as equally as possible and they are allowed to eat it immediately, or carry it home, as may best suit their pleasure.  At this feast all their councils are held, and all public business transacted. They have many other feasts; but the preceding appear to be the most prominent and are of the most frequent occurrence.  Their highest enjoyment seems to consist in eating.  Food is often difficult for them to procure; but when it is obtained they make feasts, and enjoy it as fast as they can, while it lasts, - if enjoyment can be derived from excessive alimentation.

It is performed at the time of the full moon.  This dance commences just as the moon is seen unfolding her quiet splendour in the eastern horizon, and is kept up all-night; the dancers all the time looking steadfastly at the moon.  They who are able, continue dancing through the following day - all the time gazing at the sun.  The indians affirm that some continue dancing forty eight hours.  During this rite or festival, or whatever it may be, some have cords inserted in the muscular parts of their arms and legs, to which weights are attached.  Sometimes the cord is tied to a buffaloes hide.  They dance dragging the weighs after them until the flesh tears out.  They endure this torture in order to ensure success in war.  But the Dance they most revere is called the Medicine Dance.  It is performed by both men and women.

He falls flat & appears to be convulsed - after being in this situation, vomits (or pretends to) something resembling a bean.  He then rises and commences running, and in his turn touches some other person, who screams & falls in like manner.  They pretend to fall involuntarily when touched by the medicine bags, and the spectators believe them.  The utmost confusion seems to prevail; but all is done with the greatest gravity imaginable.

They who make the most presents are the most tightly esteemed.  However highly they may value any article they possess, they do not keep it long.  The recipient of a valuable present traverses the village or encampment, singing until he has attracted the attention of all, - then proclaims, in a thundering voice, the generosity  of the donor.  This is sometimes repeated several days in succession.  The desire to have their liberality publichly proclaimed, often induces them to give away those articles necessary to their comfort.  That they are not actuated by benevolence is evident from the fact that they give least to those who most need.\nAmong themselves, hospitality prevails to a great extent.  Their circumstances and manner of life render it absolutely necessary to the existence of many, that food should be enjoyed in common.

To bestow food & shelter on those who do not stand in need, would hardly be hospitality - rather it would be prodigality, - a quality quite foreign to nobleness.  The deductions to be drawn from this method or argument above, seem to differ from the conclusion of the reverend gentleman to who I am indebted for these sketches; \"but\", says my informant, \"Should one attempt to support himself independently of the rest, they would all be, from time to time, exposed to starvation: - The precarious supply afforded by the chase, - not infrequently unsuccessful in hunting - various accidents which deprive them of, or prevent them from procuring, food, serve to perpetuate the exercise of hospitality.  In every band there are many persons unable to support themselves.  Hence they are prompted less to the exercise of hospitality by generosity, than by the laws of starvation\" Those who have acquired the habit of labouring in the cultivation of the soil, (and they are all but few), have a less precarious living, and with it a less disposition to give away their substance. - So it seems that labor has a tendency to diminish the vanity of mankind.

After being initiated, the new member is presented with the medicine bags containing medicine which is supposed to possess magical powers.  This is preserved with the greatest care.  They are instructed in the use of medicines, (whence the name, I presume,) and also in the art of magic; and further, are taught the mysteries of idolatrous worship.  This, medicine, witchcraft, and religion are connected, - forming one system; - this system constitutes the basis of the most honorable, respected and privileged order or caste among them.

At the time of interment, they make a feast and eat it at the place of burial.  For the loss of friends, they cut off their hair, black their faces, and mourn for them with a loud and lamentable cry.  Their wailings are continued, at intervals, for many days.  They also lacerate their flesh with fragments of glass and flint, until they are covered with blood.  Sometimes they thrust knives through the fleshly parts of their arms and legs, wounding themselves so severely as to faint from loss of blood.

Horses, guns or blankets are generally given in such cases.  Sometimes ten or fifteen guns are given, but often, not so much.   The prices (or presents) are given to the parents and by them distributed among the relatives.  Parents claim the right of selling their daughters; but do not often force them to marry against their wills.

The Indian name is Muscogee.* The Creeks come from the west. They have a tradition among them that there are in the fork of Red River west of the MiSsiSsippi, two mounds of earth; that at this place the CuSsetuhs, Cowetuhs, and Chickasaws, found themselves; that being distreSsed by wars with red people, they croSsed the MiSsiSsippi; directing their course eastwardly they croSsed the falls of Tal,lapoo,sa above Took,au,bat,che, settled below the falls of Chatto,ho,che and spread out from theire to Ocmulgee, O,co,nee, Savannah and down on the Sea-coast towards Charlestown.

There are obstacles in the human heart which no human agency can remove.\nFeasts\nThey attach great importance to their feasts, which are prepared and conducted with many superstitious ceremonies.  They have many feasts; but the most common are the medicine feast - feast-of-consecrated weapons, and the feast of invitation.  Food considered by them to be of an inferior quality is seldom used in making feasts.  When a religious feast is to be prepared, if the man who makes it is not a medicine man, he sends for one of that order, to whom exclusively belongs the office of master of religious or mysterious ceremonies - in the meantime the family of the feast maker is sent away.

Each one receives his food in his own dish, and if he fails to eat all that is given him, he is constrained by custom, if he be desirous to maintain his reputation unimpaired, to make a present to his host.

At this feast all their councils are held, and all public business transacted. They have many other feasts; but the preceding appear to be the most prominent and are of the most frequent occurrence.  Their highest enjoyment seems to consist in eating.  Food is often difficult for them to procure; but when it is obtained they make feasts, and enjoy it as fast as they can, while it lasts, - if enjoyment can be derived from excessive alimentation.

They who are able, continue dancing through the following day - all the time gazing at the sun.  The indians affirm that some continue dancing forty eight hours.  During this rite or festival, or whatever it may be, some have cords inserted in the muscular parts of their arms and legs, to which weights are attached.

But the very commencement of this description of it, shews at once that there is a radical difference.\nThis order is composed of both men & women.  None but the initiated are acquainted with its secret mysteries.  None can become members without paying a high price for admission.  After being initiated, the new member is presented with the medicine bags containing medicine which is supposed to possess magical powers.  This is preserved with the greatest care.  They are instructed in the use of medicines, (whence the name, I presume,) and also in the art of magic; and further, are taught the mysteries of idolatrous worship.  This, medicine, witchcraft, and religion are connected, - forming one system; - this system constitutes the basis of the most honorable, respected and privileged order or caste among them.  The members of this order pretend to be more strict in the morals than others; but this is not made evident from their general conduct.

Under such circumstances, the plain indication would be to apply a counteracting influence; and he endeavors to frighten the disease away;  \"and\" adds Mr Pond, \"if diseases could be frightened, he would surely succeed.\" - He stands over the patient, and shakes a large rattle-box, - making at the same time the most discordant noises of which the human voice is susceptible, accompanied by the most unnatural & disgusting contortions of body.

Those who can, procure a white man to make a coffin;  but when this not convenient (which is generally the case), they place strips of bark around the corpse, thus forming a nude coffin,  The graves are quite shallow, and to protect the dead from wolves they fortify the grave with small stakes.  At the time of interment, they make a feast and eat it at the place of burial.  For the loss of friends, they cut off their hair, black their faces, and mourn for them with a loud and lamentable cry.  Their wailings are continued, at intervals, for many days.  They also lacerate their flesh with fragments of glass and flint, until they are covered with blood.  Sometimes they thrust knives through the fleshly parts of their arms and legs, wounding themselves so severely as to faint from loss of blood.  They say this is done to relieve their distress of mind - something like the counteraction from a blister.  I suppose. - They invariable preserve a lock of hair from the head of a dead friend.

They often imagine they see them.  They believe the souls of mankind, previous to their sojourn in the human frame, existed elsewhere having passed through various transmigrations. And also, that mankind have done the same.  Some think they were once buffaloes and bounded over the vast pains in search of grass; and that some were once bears, etc; and others imagine they were once white men before they were indians.  They think that the souls of men go to a place which they call the house of spirits; but that they return and haunt the place where their bones were laid. - They believe the spirits of the dead have power to do them great mischief; and therefore take much pains to propitiate them.

Horses, guns or blankets are generally given in such cases.  Sometimes ten or fifteen guns are given, but often, not so much.   The prices (or presents) are given to the parents and by them distributed among the relatives.  Parents claim the right of selling their daughters; but do not often force them to marry against their wills.  Mr Pond has known some women to commit suicide in order to avoid being united to men who they did not love; so it appears that the tender passion pervades all classes and grades of the human family (except royal families), from the most savage to the most refined.

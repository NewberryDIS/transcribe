The Indian name is Muscogee.* The Creeks come from the west. They have a tradition among them that there are in the fork of Red River west of the MiSsiSsippi, two mounds of earth; that at this place the CuSsetuhs, Cowetuhs, and Chickasaws, found themselves; that being distreSsed by wars with red people, they croSsed the MiSsiSsippi; directing their course eastwardly they croSsed the falls of Tal,lapoo,sa above Took,au,bat,che, settled below the falls of Chatto,ho,che and spread out from theire to Ocmulgee, O,co,nee, Savannah and down on the Sea-coast towards Charlestown.

There are obstacles in the human heart which no human agency can remove.\nFeasts\nThey attach great importance to their feasts, which are prepared and conducted with many superstitious ceremonies.  They have many feasts; but the most common are the medicine feast - feast-of-consecrated weapons, and the feast of invitation.  Food considered by them to be of an inferior quality is seldom used in making feasts.  When a religious feast is to be prepared, if the man who makes it is not a medicine man, he sends for one of that order, to whom exclusively belongs the office of master of religious or mysterious ceremonies - in the meantime the family of the feast maker is sent away.

At this feast all their councils are held, and all public business transacted. They have many other feasts; but the preceding appear to be the most prominent and are of the most frequent occurrence.  Their highest enjoyment seems to consist in eating.  Food is often difficult for them to procure; but when it is obtained they make feasts, and enjoy it as fast as they can, while it lasts, - if enjoyment can be derived from excessive alimentation.

They who are able, continue dancing through the following day - all the time gazing at the sun.  The indians affirm that some continue dancing forty eight hours.  During this rite or festival, or whatever it may be, some have cords inserted in the muscular parts of their arms and legs, to which weights are attached.  Sometimes the cord is tied to a buffaloes hide.  They dance dragging the weighs after them until the flesh tears out.  They endure this torture in order to ensure success in war.

For the loss of friends, they cut off their hair, black their faces, and mourn for them with a loud and lamentable cry.  Their wailings are continued, at intervals, for many days.

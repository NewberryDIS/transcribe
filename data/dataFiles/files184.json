I am satisfied there is some good reason why I have not heart; for our relations are of such a characters that no other conclusion could be entertained. We have long been old friends, and I trust away may sustain the same happy relations. How are you prospering this session with your school? Have you a large number of scholars? How does life pass with you? Are you enjoying this peculiar world, even in this great country of the West? You perceive that I am still in this isolated spot of Kentucky, about to be shut out for a few month from the rest of mankind \"by heaps\" of mud! Think when the present session closes I shall leave this place and take a look at other situations hoping there may be some to be found composed of different materials.

A male and female teacher are required. They will pay a good male teacher from forty to fifty dollars per month.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42466,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/42466","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/9c3145737c5be3e31b593234e1df2b7d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/9c3145737c5be3e31b593234e1df2b7d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/9c3145737c5be3e31b593234e1df2b7d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9c3145737c5be3e31b593234e1df2b7d.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T13:44:41+00:00","modified":"2020-04-24T21:16:53+00:00","filename":"9c3145737c5be3e31b593234e1df2b7d.jpg","authentication":"0ad023a6a6933776201e1d8d61382553","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_081_006_002_o2.jpg","size":1527382,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2869,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049293920968721},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170806"],"TimeCreated":["230504"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170806"],"TimeCreated":["230504"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170806"],"TimeCreated":["230504"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"9c3145737c5be3e31b593234e1df2b7d.jpg","FileDateTime":1509457255,"FileSize":1527382,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2869\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2869,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:07 11:20:01","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:06 23:05:04","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:06 23:05:04","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2983,"ExifImageLength":3743,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":184,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/184","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Should he please the people, his continuance through the season will be desired.

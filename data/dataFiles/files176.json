My school in Salsbury commences on the 30th of Aug & I shall have to start from here as soon as possible after I get through - as soon as the 10th of Aug & probably before so that if you do not come before the time that the Dr. says you will not find us here and I have some business here that I must leave with you to settle - and if Sarah wishes to see us she must come the moment her school is done - She can get all ready and leave as soon as it is done and get here before we go probably - and unless Myron gets here before we, he cannot go with us - I shall send most of my things instead","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40999,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/40999","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/61b15e388245f610686671cc33e3e232.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/61b15e388245f610686671cc33e3e232.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/61b15e388245f610686671cc33e3e232.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/61b15e388245f610686671cc33e3e232.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T17:37:23+00:00","modified":"2020-05-19T03:15:48+00:00","filename":"61b15e388245f610686671cc33e3e232.jpg","authentication":"657b86d5a226b610fb202bd26eb584aa","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_039_007_03_o2.jpg","size":1393895,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2720,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047450129357298},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024615"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024615"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024615"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"61b15e388245f610686671cc33e3e232.jpg","FileDateTime":1509384747,"FileSize":1393895,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2720\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2720,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:24 14:51:56","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:24 02:46:15","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:24 02:46:15","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":21,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3237,"ExifImageLength":4283,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":176,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/176","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"of selling them for nothing, as I can carry between all three horse and all for less than forty dolls - I shall send Jesse with most of my heavy things & my horse in about 2 weeks, as the freight will be cheaper.

I have not time to give you any advice as to your future course. I was in hopes that you would have wisdom so sufficient about you to come out here before I left that I might give you the wealth of my experience, but as you have done differently I do not see but that you must grope your way in dark as I have done. In reference to a Music Teacher, all that I can tell you is that Miss Franks will not do. The People will not send their Scholars to her. Miss Cicel might give the Lessons - but you then loose the tuition, & also would loose the Music Club from the School - I must confess that I don't admire your arrangement for Teachers. The Primary department I could cut loose from The School - it now amts to nothing since Helen left it , it has cost me more than $100 out of Pocket- in fact it has done nothing since Josephine Stedman had it - She broke it up - and I believe she will break up any school. However much you may think of her as a woman, don't be fooled as to think, that hence, she is a good Teacher. And again I hope she will treat you differently from what she has me - her bills for her school amounted to about $70 dolls.

You must overlook my neglecting to write to you as there were some things \nwhich I wanted to know before I did. We recieved \npapers from you last week. We are all quite well except \nthe baby & hope this will find you the same. We live in \nthe same place that we did last year only have moved \nup stairs. Mr. Smith lives down below. Uncle Cheney \nhas moved down to the Pike place. Uncle John Nickerson \nhas bought the large place which Grandfather used to \nown & has moved down this spring, & Grandpa has gone \nto live with them. He talks of going to the Cape before \nlong, to stay a while. I went up there yesterday with \nCousin Jesse J Kendall from the Cape. He has been up \nabout six weeks & is going back in about a fortnight. \nEdwin is at work for Mr. Phiny? P. Gould. David continues \nto live with Mr. Smith. Jesse is going to live at Uncle Cutting's \nthis summer. Father has been at work for Mr. Lewis Brigham \nthis winter has taken a job in Petersham for the summer  \nHe does pretty much the same. I believe father's case come on \nin June after you went away. It was decided in his favor. \nMr. Powers carried it to the Supreme Court & it came on \nlast week. Father got the case again. Mr. Powers is to pay the cost \non both scores (which is not small) & to pay for the sixty seven \ndollars besides. I expect it is settled unless Mr. Powers carries \nit on farther.

How many times I have wished I could see you & have a long talk  with you but I suppose I must be deprived of the privelege of them for the present.

Last week we had considerable hard wood brought to us from Uncle Francis expect some more I suppose Edwin will be responsible for it.  We have meat necessaries & clothing to make us comfortable we have a stove also but have not got our best furniture nor bedding but we have enough to get along very well with.  I do not feel worried at all but that we shall get along.  We have been to school at No 5 about 3 weeks. Grammar + Arithmetic are my principal studies but expect to begin Philosophy to morrow and don't know but that I shall study Algebra some . Edwin goes to school up in town.

I have 4 in Adams Arithmetic, 9 in Cobburns?, 4 in Grammar, 11 in Geography, and 12 that write, and 5 small ones which read, & ? spelling book I am kept pretty much busy.

It is very hilly in this district so much so that they call it dry hill and it is rather in the northeastern part of the town some distance from the centre on account of which they hold meetings at the schoolhouse and have preaching part of the time.

I heard from Raymond he was at Whitingham at school. Edwin is at work at Barre for David Kendall. I had a letter from cousin Sarah Cheney she is teaching No 3 she was well and said the rest of Phillipston people were. As to Grandfather and his folks I presume they are well. I go down to Eliza's frequently and think of going down next Saturday. I should like to see Erasmus and Sister Sarah very much. Monday morning. The people here have gone to Montague plains to hoeing to day. I presume that you know where they are. You have to cross them to go to Greenfield. Monday morning has come again and soon I must be trudging to school again. O how much patience it requires to suit all and what a responsibility rest upon a teacher.

I shall leave here about the 18th of February and that will be about the time you will go to Chesterfield I suppose, and if so, be sure and come this way and have Lydia too if she comes, for I want to see you both much and know","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":41075,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/41075","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/0feaa9ab6208853c5cec7d46f93e2d82.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/0feaa9ab6208853c5cec7d46f93e2d82.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/0feaa9ab6208853c5cec7d46f93e2d82.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0feaa9ab6208853c5cec7d46f93e2d82.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T17:41:16+00:00","modified":"2020-04-09T23:31:11+00:00","filename":"0feaa9ab6208853c5cec7d46f93e2d82.jpg","authentication":"e3e4b2b0ff402b138278ea577674106d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_041_006_03_o2.jpg","size":1467968,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2899,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046886154868218},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["235459"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["235459"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["235459"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0feaa9ab6208853c5cec7d46f93e2d82.jpg","FileDateTime":1509384750,"FileSize":1467968,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2899\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2899,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:26 15:14:19","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:24 23:54:59","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:24 23:54:59","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":27,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3368,"ExifImageLength":4181,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":176,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/176","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"all the particulars of the family, where Mother and all the little boys are going to be during the present years.

It is a pleasure of which I would not be denied. It give me real delight to think of the many happy hours we have spent together and I, to, not infrequently think of the many of many sad and trying hours we have passed together and must say that the recollection of them, in one point of view, gives me pleasure, for I think we have learned a lesson from them we may not soon forget.

What pleasant walks we used to have that winter. I often wish I could have the company of a brother now for at times I feel somewhat lonely, but I must say notwithstanding I enjoy myself very much indeed fr you know that I have a first rate boarding place. Mr. Goodnow and wife are very pleasant people, and try to make me happy, and I feel myself perfectly at home. I have a very pleasant school of thirty-four scholars - the oldest eleven - the youngest - four. The gentleman who teaches the large school is Mr. Houston from Acworth N.H. He has taught at Papermill Village; he does not board at Mr. Goodnow's. The Miss Bowkers called upon me a short time since. Janette inquired for you; said she enjoyed herself much this fall at Chesterfield. Charlotte Marsh has been here about a fortnight with her sister ( Mrs. Edwin Goodnow).

This is the annual examination and we expect a large audience; hear of many that are coming from different parts. I dread it some, for I have a composition of about five pages to read; subject \"Study of Nature\" and there has been a political Colloquy composed for the occasion in which each scholar takes a part; hope we shall all succeed in everything we undertake so as to bring honor upon ourselves, but am afraid I shall fail. It takes place the last Wednesday in this month (the 29th I believe). Want you should come very much if your school is through so that you can; come down to Phillipston and then come with Uncle Kendall's girls; they would like to come and I will return home with you if I do not go to Pembroke, but if I do cannot, as I shall have no vacation as fall term commences there the 5th of August. Mother is at Albany; have heard from her since she went there by way of brother Erasmus; expects to return home the last of this month. Have heard from Edwin several times this summer; am going to write him to come here at the close of the school if possible. Also have heard from Lydia and she likes her school much and do really hope that she will succeed well in it. Raymond thinks of remaining at Norwich University as a teacher this fall. Rebecca was here the first of the term but she had to go home on account of her limbs and I have missed her much. O! how I want to see you all brothers and sister and mother; guess if I could I shouldn't employ so slow and deliberate a manner of communicating my feelings to you as by pen and paper.

If brothers only knew the depth of a Sister's love and confidence they would yield to their wishes and seek their society more than many do; but I have no reason to complain of my brothers in this respect, far from it; they are ever kind and ready to assist their brother or sisters and even make great self denials to do it; would that I had better opportunities of proving to them my gratitude and love; no, I would not exchange them for any others that could be named.

You recollect I suppose of seeing me safely deposited in the stage on the 27th with the intention of reaching my destined place that night, but it was \"no go\"; when I reached Bellow Falls who should I meet there but Raymond, coming after me; as I did not come and had not written him he did not know what to make of it; was afraid I was sick and was on his way to a ascertain the facts in regard to the matter. Well as a natural consequence, of course, he must go and see Abby and I must go with him as we were so near and delay going to Lebanon until the next day (Friday). Accordingly we went to Rockingham and took dinner and in the afternoon we all went down to Papermill Village and found the folks very glad to see us.

At none o'clock Andrews Latin Lessons, half past Olmstead's Natural  (class of eight gentlemen), half past ten Geography (large class) of the Heavens, at eleven Davies First Lessons (about twenty) in Algebra, quarter before twelve French Grammar and Exercises. P.M. At two second class in Grammar and Parsing, half past Telemaque? Gelemaque? Yelemaque?, three Smellie's Natural History, half past Corinne?, four Abercrombie's Intellectual Philosophy. In Wednesday afternoons the young ladies meet me and read their compositions; there is about thirty of them. School numbers seventy. Alas! it is Thursday night and this scribbling to you is not finished yet and you are wondering why Sister Sarah don't write you, but I have set down with a determination to finish this and write another letter to night- as I am much more at liberty this eve than I have been before this week. Sabbath eve after I commenced to write you was interrupted by a caller. Monday we also made a call and received one, Tuesday we corrected twenty compositions, Wednesday we attended a lecture and to night - have told you what I am going to do. There are three churches here and regular preaching at each. The Universalist is very prettily furnished (I attend this) there is a good & large society and the preaching excellent. I wish you could listen to it with me sometimes, it is so elevating and soul-stirring. The Academy is in the hands of this society. Rev. Mr. Mason (our minister) is associate Principal in the school and a smart and good man he is; he has no recitation however, is acquainted with all the modern languages and will teach them if any wish.

Sophia is attending school in Phillipston (they have a fall school there taught by Elkiss Patrick of Athol) and is studying Latin, French and Geometry; what do you suppose some of our relatives will say to that? Had a letter this morning from one of my dear friends  at Pembroke, writes very affectionately; the school is prospering finely there considering all things, have about one hundred scholars. Had one also from Miss Gray (you recollect her) lives in South Orange, her health is still very poor. Received three papers from Mr. Goodnow since same here, how much I think of his family and how much I have enjoyed myself in it. Many are the dear friends and acquaintances I have found in my wanderings that I shall never see again. I love not to think of it. \n[Right-hand side] Please remember me to Mr. Marsh's people also to Miss head's? and tell them the story of my journey and introduction here. I have not felt the effects of any earthquake here yet; so I conclude your school does not increase much; hope you are enjoying yourself; hear nothing but good news of my success here as yet, but don't  know how it will be before the term is out, or how long I shall stay here.

It seems to me that I never saw Nature so lovely, or her scenery so beautiful as it was from there to Troy.  Recollect you how a noble steamer swept the waters of the Hudson at our right as it to outrun us? Many sweet remembrances have I, dear brother treasured up within my soul of times spent with you in admiring Nature's works. My heart is filled to overflowing as I contemplate them.

In the morning we were occupied in school, in the afternoon we had a walk and the evening the young ladies and gentlemen spent with me at my boarding place The refreshments consisted of various kinds of nuts, raisins and apples. One of the ladies crowned me \"queen of May.\" We had a very happy time. I had fear when I came here last fall that I should not remain so long or succeed as well. I feel that a great responsibility is resting upon me and that I am young to occupy such a station, but I try to do well and conduct myself so that my influence shall be good and trust I succeed in some degree. I understand that Miss Woodbury is coming here to school this summer; shall be glad to see her. Miss Barber from Wardsboro, VT has been here this spring and intends staying through the two next terms. I attended school with her at Swansey - I think there will be quite a number from Swansey way here this fall. Write soon. Your ever loving Sister Sarah J.

In regards to what you wrote about the\nproposals Raymond made you I want you to do what you think\nwill make you happiest and be the best for you.

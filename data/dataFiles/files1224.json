The report was causet by Opt. calling the guards in to swear them in a Deputy Sheriffs as they only had been sworn the first time for 30 days; they being sworn this time for 90 days and the strikers seeing the men called in, supposed it was to be sent away.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                 Wednesday April 18\/88\n\nToday Opt. reports everything quiet since he reported yesterday.

Stranburg made his appearance and told Opr that the old men were broke up over they Dynamite business they did not believe in that kind of business he told Opr also that there was a fight in the Hall that some threateneed to leave the Brotherhood and never join again. it was on account of the Dynamite case Opr and Stranburg took a walk to the Gardls? Saloon where they met Updike and Joe Benso. each of the two last mentioned took drinks and spoke as though they expected to see some of the boys arrested here. as they were sure some of the leading strikers have been watched lately, they (the Company) will drum up some charge. Opr and Stranburg went to the Clifton House at 5.45pm where we met Engineer Wardrope who had just come in from Buda. They were talking on the corner when Renick Martin came up and called Wardrope to one side. Opr saw Wardrope hand him a letter, and they then went towards the hall. Wardrope returned 15 mintues later. he told Opr he would receive his 40.00 next Monday. he said the letter he gave Martin was a statement of how things appeared at Buda written by a Sympathizer located at Buda at 7.30pm. Op took a good walk up town with Wardrope and Boyd and visited Gardls, Allens and Moores Saloons met several strikers at Moores, who said they were going to the Circus. All consented to go","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":96694,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/96694","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e926c9f951221db34924c5c66ca29102.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e926c9f951221db34924c5c66ca29102.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e926c9f951221db34924c5c66ca29102.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e926c9f951221db34924c5c66ca29102.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T21:54:02+00:00","modified":"2020-06-30T13:37:35+00:00","filename":"e926c9f951221db34924c5c66ca29102.jpg","authentication":"a2f6135709650a3883c1b4f8f5d6f72b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"cbq_033_1880_09_box_110_fl_830_006_09_o2.jpg","size":911553,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2315,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.036459203263739},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20181030"],"TimeCreated":["041151"],"By-line":["The Newberry Library"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["887766"],"Source":["CB&Q 33 1880 9 Box 110"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20181030"],"TimeCreated":["041151"],"By-line":["The Newberry Library"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["887766"],"Source":["CB&Q 33 1880 9 Box 110"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20181030"],"TimeCreated":["041151"],"By-line":["The Newberry Library"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["887766"],"Source":["CB&Q 33 1880 9 Box 110"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e926c9f951221db34924c5c66ca29102.jpg","FileDateTime":1586728404,"FileSize":911553,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2315\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2315,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/10.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:10:31 10:19:45","Artist":"The Newberry Library","Exif_IFD_Pointer":190},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":10,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:10:30 04:11:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:10:30 04:11:51","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6.643856,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2778,"ExifImageLength":4320,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1224,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1224","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"at 8.20 p.m they went to the grounds.

Opr spent part of the day going around to the saloons and mixing with the strikers thinking he might be able to overhear some of their conversation. As to the line of defense they were gong to make but could learn nothing in the evening Opr went around with the City Marshall they went to the White Elephant Saloon. Also remained around the saloon of the Brown Hotel mixing with people but was unable to learn anything of importance.

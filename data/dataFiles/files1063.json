& the unclear, and from the banks of the Wolga to the Lake Baikal; we cannot refrain from the conclusion, that this skeleton [the one described as found 10 miles from Sparta, White County p196] belonged to a human body of the same race, education and notions? with those who lived on the Volga, Tanais, & Obey.  The same unknown cause which, in the course of 2000 years, has reduced the size of the ancient Scythians & their tribes, the Gauls, and Germans, and Sarmatians, has produced the same effects here. The descendants of these giants, both in the old & new world, agree with each other in bulk, as their ancestors did with each other, which proves a uniform cause operating equally both in the old & new world.  The decrease in bulk seems to have kept pace every where with the increase of warm temperature, and with the abbreviation of longevity.

The result was a communication, some time afterwards, from him, carefully reduced to writing; which, with the materials referred to, were submitted to the examination of medical gentlemen at Nashville. The written communication from Mr Lane, was dated on the 26th July 1820; and stated, that he had undertaken to make some further discoveries amongst the little tombs which seemed to be peculiar to the settlement in which he lived, a few miles from Sparta. He found in one of the small graves (the package no.1) the fractured part of a skeleton.

It is stated to have been represented by them, that about four feet before the surface, on the side of elevated ground of an acclivity of about ten degrees from the horizon, they struck a wall of stone from eight to nine feet thick. They followed it one hundred and sixty feet, and came to a corner; thence one hundred and forty feet at right angles, and came to another corner. They then pursued it no further, having found the ground that it enclosed. They dug into the interior, & three or four feet below the surface found great numbers of human bones in different apartments, both small and full grown, in regular rows, of the same stature as men of the present race. The wall was computed to be of the depth of at least nine feet, so far as they as they had gone. The cement was distinguishable, and was of a bluish cast. The stones were large, and also of a blue colour, The marks of the hammer upon the stone were also apparent. In the year 1794, was discovered in North Carolina, a subterranean wall, about twelve miles above Salisbury, in Rowan county. It was parallell to a small branch, which ran into a creek about 300 yards below the wall.

Two covers of vessels were found in a mound in Ross county, in Ohio, very ingeniously wrought by the artist, and highly polished. They resemble almost exactly, and were quite equal to, vessels of the same materials manufactured in Italy at the present time.\nA number of pieces of glass, of singular workmanship, were lately found at Hamburgh, in the state of New York. They were taken from an ancient barrow in the town of Hamburgh, where they were found deposited in an earthen pot.

their dealings with the Indians, engage to give fair compensation for whatever the Indians yield to them, either collectively or individually.\n\nThe first treaty of emigration in 1807, on the principle of fair payment, guarantees acre for acre for lands.\n\n    Guided by this principle of fair compensation, in the thirteenth Cherokee Treaty, being their first of emigration, (see Synopsis page 25), the United States expressly proclaim that they exchange \"acre for are\" of their own lands in the west, for those of the Indians in the east; -- and when, in the fifteenth Treaty, being the third of emigration, (see Synopsis, page 40), a change of location in the west is agreed on by the Cherokees, in order to make up to them for the smaller value of the substituted land, the United States, to the acre for acre,\" add the sum of fifty thousand dollars.\n\nProof that payment for lands in money was to be expected, where there could be no equivalent in land.\n\n    Thus it appears

They received no lands in return. They were already in possession of the seven millions of acres to which they have been recently removed.

Treaty of 1838, the Cherokee country east was paid for in money.\n\n    Not being paid in lands for the final cession of their national domain, the nation was entitled by our own principles and laws and precedents, to payment in some shape; and to a payment for it entirely apart from that for private and other claims.\n\nIndividual claims were also required to be provided for apart.\n\n    Hence

Its decisions were not only to be final, but it appears to have had almost unlimited powers. It commenced its operations in September, 1836, & closed them on the 5th of March, 1839. In order to facilitate its proceedings, a committee of Cherokees was appointed by the twelfth article of the Treaty, to look into the claims presented by their countrymen.

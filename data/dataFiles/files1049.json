The whites regarded him as a great chief, but his nation only looked on him as a great orator; he was the speaker of the council, but limited in his influence. His greatest fame among the Cherokees generally was built upon the eloquence with which he reported to them the opinions of others in his speeches, - not upon any great confidence they reposed in his own opinions. Hence he was chosen speaker of the Council, word scratched out an office word scratched out which might be better represented word scratched out to our understanding by the title of the explainer word scratched out for the council. He had long been eminent at the time when Black Fox came into power. His residence was at the foot of Muscle Shoals(?). On the north side of the Tennessee, he had word scratched out considerable sway over the population; but there it was thin and widely scattered. He had married the sister words scratched out of James Vann's wife; word scratched out and it was reported used her words scratched out brutally. But he was a favorite among the whites, words scratched out because he words scratched out fell in with their plans, and they over rated his power.

The translation was conveyed in turn by several who understood English; sometimes the exact interpretation would be discussed, and sometimes one would explain a sentence for which another could not find words.

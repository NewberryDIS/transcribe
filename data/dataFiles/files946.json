BEAUCHAMP to whom I am indebted for much material says he had obtained a mask + when about leaving the Reservation was asked by an Indian friend for some Tobacco-I gave him some-he wrapped 1\/2 of it in a bit of callico, formed into a bag + hung it upon the top of the mask-the other he threw into a fire-a little at a time in intervals of a few seconds. He then told me that I should do this every 3 months + renew the tobacco in the bag-by doing so I would be free of the frights + illness the mask might otherwise cause me, when the mask deprived of the dancing + feasting, which it was accustomed to take part. I have not renewed the tobacco + often show the mask at various places + it behaves well. *The sacred tobacco is the NICOTIANA RUSTICA-or Indian tobacco, its bloom is yellow.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":59245,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/59245","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/0a55e7e8bf2b228f3f2ffa41298449d6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/0a55e7e8bf2b228f3f2ffa41298449d6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/0a55e7e8bf2b228f3f2ffa41298449d6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0a55e7e8bf2b228f3f2ffa41298449d6.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-17T15:45:16+00:00","modified":"2020-03-23T17:05:06+00:00","filename":"0a55e7e8bf2b228f3f2ffa41298449d6.jpg","authentication":"982ac8e96c758e4a00a3517588626530","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_Art_Grider_Descriptions_00035_o2.jpg","size":1541188,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3600,"resolution_y":2256,"compression_ratio":0.063254695298135},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120628"],"TimeCreated":["094702+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120628"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120628"],"TimeCreated":["094702+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120628"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120628"],"TimeCreated":["094702+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120628"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0a55e7e8bf2b228f3f2ffa41298449d6.jpg","FileDateTime":1521301481,"FileSize":1541188,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3600\" height=\"2256\"","Height":2256,"Width":3600,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"45mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:10:26 08:44:50","Exif_IFD_Pointer":154},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:28 09:47:02","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:28 09:47:02","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":78,"SubSecTimeDigitized":78,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":6896,"ExifImageLength":4322,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":946,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/946","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"In this masked dances all sing, while dancing.

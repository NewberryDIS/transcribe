And I hope written down left hand side of page I suppose you hear from our brother Charlie often we recieved a paper from him last evening - our last letter told us he had been suffering from a severe cold but was better - Chandler has not sold but wants to - if not all a part - but I don't know a satisfactory opportunity - Ena has been going to school Love to Mr. Kendall I'm glad Mr. Weaver's family have been to visit love","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43530,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43530","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/23f7577c306bf29c6032859a64f5cfce.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/23f7577c306bf29c6032859a64f5cfce.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/23f7577c306bf29c6032859a64f5cfce.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/23f7577c306bf29c6032859a64f5cfce.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T19:55:01+00:00","modified":"2020-01-21T21:02:30+00:00","filename":"23f7577c306bf29c6032859a64f5cfce.jpg","authentication":"a7eb6a112eaf8e1c5a98efc739e79602","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_058_008_002_o2.jpg","size":1087525,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2301,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.043762172646353},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["224534"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["224534"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["224534"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"23f7577c306bf29c6032859a64f5cfce.jpg","FileDateTime":1509479592,"FileSize":1087525,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2301\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2301,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:02 10:06:02","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:01 22:45:34","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:01 22:45:34","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":54,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3021,"ExifImageLength":4726,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":190,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/190","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"now no.

Emily staid two days, and Thursday evening we went to the dance again, and I've had no chance to write till this eve? Maria Goldsbury is probably in Davenport, Iowa. She started Monday afternoon. She gave up the idea of stopping in Laporte now, but thought she should on her return. She went in company with Mr* Willis of Winchester and couldn't stop without losing his company. 'Twas'nt the Willis that used to keep the Union Store. 'Twas Emerson Lyman's wife's father, and a stranger to her, but she thought she would rather have some company. You have probably heard of Gardiner Gale's death. It was ver sad indeed. We received a letter from Oscar a short time ago saying Aunt Wright was very low, and thought it very doubtfull if she ever recovered. Rodana is with her. We are all about as usual, that is, all well but mother. She is about as usual and that is feeble. I have thought she was better for a few days past, but she has her poor turns and the is better for a few days perhaps. She says she don't see how in the world you can stay away so long or what can be the reason you don't come next summer. Others go and come once a year and why not you? As for economy. The style you are licing in Economy in our opinion is not the reason. Whatever it is, I think if possible you better arrange affairs to come another summer. Others come and go once a year, and why not you? As for economy, the style that you are  living in does'n't indicate a want of means, certainly. You don't think anything would tempt me to go west? Yes, just the tought of seeing you is a very strong temptation -- But Abby, in mother's present condition I could not leave her unless she went over to Emily's. She needs some one -- an own daughter to wait upon her, and take care of her. She staid with Emily most of the time I was teaching, but she prefers being at home best. Beside Emily has enough to take care of, and I feel it is my duty to stay here, and make her as comfortable as possible. I should like to go west -- so would mother, and if she should get able as I hope she will we may come sometime. But you can come here and we all can see you, and certainly all can't go to see you there.\nM28 3","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43598,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43598","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8765a60bfb4deb1ac566f558121aeb54.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8765a60bfb4deb1ac566f558121aeb54.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8765a60bfb4deb1ac566f558121aeb54.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8765a60bfb4deb1ac566f558121aeb54.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T19:58:33+00:00","modified":"2020-01-21T21:02:31+00:00","filename":"8765a60bfb4deb1ac566f558121aeb54.jpg","authentication":"d985c39eafa745fcc7fdf6714a05a686","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_059_006_001_o2.jpg","size":1672516,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2249,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.068858422673452},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["030253"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["030253"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["030253"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8765a60bfb4deb1ac566f558121aeb54.jpg","FileDateTime":1509479595,"FileSize":1672516,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2249\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2249,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:02 10:09:10","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:01 03:02:53","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:01 03:02:53","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2727,"ExifImageLength":4364,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":190,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/190","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Monday Evening Apr, 9th, 1860\nDear Sister Abby:\nI was going to write you a good long letter and Charles one, but as Emily has just sent up one to be mailed \"West\" and as she has probably narrated all current events up to this date, I guess I'll forbear you a little while and just snatch the opportunity to thank you and Charles each for your last kind letters and assure you that all the items shall in due time be expatiated upon.

So Chandler and I in company with Mr Lincoln & wife went down We went to call on Mr. Reed's family, and they gave me such a cordial invitation and so kindly, insisted on my staying, that knowing how lonely my home seemed now, at length consented, so after the lecture which was rich they came home and left me. and I spent a very pleasant week there. which I will tell you more about whenI see you.  Spent one afternoon and evening with unclear Mr. Moors and wife very pleasantly. Mr. Reed and his family are very pleasant people I became quite attached to them of course as I always do to good folks. and here I must say good night with love from Mary - written vertically on page Abby I thank you and brother Kendall for your kind and cordial invitation to visit you - and it seemed when mother died I must go right, off - it seems as if I must now see you and Charles - and yet I dont know what is best I think however it wont be best for me to come just at present for several reasons that make it inconvenient - And yet I want so much to see you - Chandler has kindly cordially told me I should have a home with him as long as he had one - And he and Rhoda seem anxious to have me stay, - (perhaps I may be needed particularly confidential - And yet you know Abby - that I am now alone comparatively, in the world - And as long as I am well I feel that 'tis my duty to be doing something and not be a drone in God's great hive. But what to do is the next question I'm tired of teaching and just at present I must confess I dont feel much ambition to do anything - Still I feel I must hold myself in readiness when unclear God points out the way - My heart would lead me to you - Still I hope I am ready to go and do whatever My Father thinks best - I hope for his guidance I send a copy of Mother's will if you and Charles are satisfied you are to send your confidence to Chandler and he will put it execution. Mother's idea in having Charles written as it was to have it remain longer at interest if he did'nt need it at present - I'll tell him when I see him","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43637,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43637","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/91f422c07999d053d38a77d7893df932.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/91f422c07999d053d38a77d7893df932.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/91f422c07999d053d38a77d7893df932.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/91f422c07999d053d38a77d7893df932.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T20:00:19+00:00","modified":"2020-01-21T21:02:31+00:00","filename":"91f422c07999d053d38a77d7893df932.jpg","authentication":"23d312828ff62c6b43687a1ee6b71c08","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_060_002_011_o2.jpg","size":1240067,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2250,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051031563786008},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["030821"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["030821"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["030821"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"91f422c07999d053d38a77d7893df932.jpg","FileDateTime":1509479596,"FileSize":1240067,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2250\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2250,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:02 10:10:59","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:01 03:08:21","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:01 03:08:21","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1977,"ExifImageLength":3163,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":190,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/190","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"pencil note unclear\nA Copy of the Last will and Testament of Jerusha M.

He has'nt been naughty but once. Then he turned over the gingerbread jar and fereted out a card of gingerbread and run off with it.

I play back-gammon with Auntie Mary and I beat once. Auntie Mary said I took after my Papa and Mamma. I read, and tell my little hymn and fold my hands and keep very still during \"Exercises\", and I guess I'm real good. Auntie Mary tells me I am and says I must grow up a real good nice man just like my papa, and I'm going to.

Mr Murray was civil engineer on the Michigan Central Railroad for some time. Is aquainted some, with Judge Niles and Mr. Hannah of Laporte. Afterwards was in a store in Chicago, is now a land ageent - I believe. Their house is well furnished and they seem to be good nice people. Mary has a very nice piano and plays very well indeed. They have a great many books several nice paintings in gilt frames, a Brussells carpet and a large stuffed rocking chair like yours, and other things to correspond They live one side of my school-house and Mr. Bailey's family the other. Mr. Bailey's family were from Danvill Ill. Last autumn. I've spent one night with them and called several times. Jennie has a piano and plays very well - And you know I enjoy music ever so much, we sing in school when ever I can find time. I only teach five days in the week. So you see I have every Saturday for my own use - Three Saturdays I have been to Chicago Once I went with Mr. Rexford to see about books &c. And once i went to meet Charles. He went in from La Porte on an Excursion trip, but it did'nt pass here - so he wrote me he was going and wanted I should meet him there. So I did, we had a nice visit. Took dinner at the Adams house close by the depot you know, after dinner I did a little shopping then we went down to the Central Park to see the skating. They had a Grand Carnival that afternoon led by a band of music. Enjoyed it ever so much. Then Charles came back here with me at night and we spend the Sabbath together, had a fire by ourselves and could talk over all we wished to. He had been very well for him all winter. But he took some cold that day in Chicago, down to the Skating park and I had rather a bad night Sunday night but was better in the morning, he left at 7 o'clock Monday morning on the Michigan Central. I enjoyed the visit, oh! so much! Last Saturday I went into Chicago in the morning and spent Saturday and Sunday with the family where I stopped last autumn when I was there. Sunday I attended the Congregational Church with them, and the Sabbath school in the afternoon. That I enjoyed very much indeed and returned here Sunday evening. There is no church in this place. There is {one two in Blue Island four miles from here, but I have no opportunity of attending. They are Baptist & Orthodox churches I think - I have attended one funeral here, a young man from Danville the same night and in the same car that I came in here Jan 3rd to visit at Mr. Baileys, was taken sick the next day, and never again went out of the house. He died in four weeks after he arrived. I attended his funeral - I have not heard from Warwick since I came here. I have not written. I'm going to write soon. I received $7,00 in your letter, which with the $3,00 you gave me when I left make $10,00 I have received of the amount Chandler sent. You must give each the little boys a kiss from Auntie Mary. I hope you will write often. I would like very uch to have Eddie go to school, but he is not quite old enough. But I hope you will not neglect to instruct him, and make him advance as fast as his mind and body will allow.

I want you should have just such a nice garden, and you might have had by this time if they had taken any kind of care of it. Its a shame is'nt it! I suppose Mr. Bailey is raising a great deal of his fruit and vegatables for market in Chicago. He says he thinks 'Twill be more profitable than raising grain, and he thinks some of turning his whole farm into a garden and orchard You know I like every-thing that grows so I shall enjoy the garden the garden any how and I shall make the most of all other sources of enjoyment - Miss Jennie Bailey has an excellent piano and she plays and sings a great deal and very well. This I enjoy of course and she has kindly offered me the free use of her piano whenever I wish to practice and to assist me to, if I wish. I intend to avail myself of the opportunity what time I can spare, Then they have several horses and they ride horse back a great deal. I've rode once. Jennie & Mary Murray rode this morning. They ride very often and go like the wind on colts or any thing else - I had to have an old stump tailed madam, the mother of a dozen or two colts, saddled for me 'cause I'm inexperienced you know, and I could'nt fall off her because she was so broad in the flanks. I've had two or three buggy rides also, last Sabbath I went with Mr. Bailey, son and daughter about 10 or 12 miles to attend a meeting but was to late for the services - but the ride was very pleasant.

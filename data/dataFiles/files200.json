The Bible then is not averse to Education. Religion and learning go hand in hand. They are Essentially one. A true Education covers both. Any acquaintance with God in his spiritual nature and in his works constitutes the \"Wisdom and knowledge\" which are prescribed to render stable the church of God.\nAnd here let it be observed that the truth of this scripture statement is confirmed in a Signal manner by the Element of permanence in the institutions of learning themselves. Humanly speaking no institutions of the world live like schools of higher learning. The colleges of Oxford and Cambridge have outlived the dynasties of Tudors and Stuarts. The Monarchy might perish forever, and these would flourish in immortal youth. Harvard and Yale, and Brown and Columbia, and Nassan Hall, and the University of Pennsylvania survived the Revolution, and Southern Colleges are the first to come forth from the Calamities of the Rebellion.\nSuch facts are suggestive and lead to the inquiry which we shall consider this morning.

If it is true that God created the worlds\nand the laws which govern them it is also true\nthat He has dominion over them \"We may regard\nthe universe as a huge machine would\nby natural powers or mechanical laws, but it\nis the finger of God that touches the Subordinative\nagencies which move the whole.\" Those forms\nof infidelity which deny this are nothing new.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":45341,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/45341","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/226007fe7261ceb668b1425b4643e722.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/226007fe7261ceb668b1425b4643e722.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/226007fe7261ceb668b1425b4643e722.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/226007fe7261ceb668b1425b4643e722.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-03T17:10:13+00:00","modified":"2019-11-12T21:28:38+00:00","filename":"226007fe7261ceb668b1425b4643e722.jpg","authentication":"869eadea22127c9a635f50082db57488","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_taylor_e_bx_01_fl_004_01_003_o2.jpg","size":1317448,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2888,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042238894018672},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170921"],"TimeCreated":["025556"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170921"],"TimeCreated":["025556"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170921"],"TimeCreated":["025556"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"226007fe7261ceb668b1425b4643e722.jpg","FileDateTime":1509728448,"FileSize":1317448,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2888\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2888,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/9.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:09:21 15:01:15","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":9,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:09:21 02:55:56","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:09:21 02:55:56","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6.33985,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2427,"ExifImageLength":3025,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":200,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/200","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Needs Review","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Whether with Pantheism we confound the Creator with the Creation\nand leave no God beside, or with Naturalism\nacknowledge a God above nature but banish\nHim into Solitude and leave his works to\nand endless series of developments, both\nalike are unsatisfactory and will not answer\nus no an hour like this.

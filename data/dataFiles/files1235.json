Joe says he has blown you up about going to Mass. & it would be foolish to be at that expense merely for pleasure but if some important benefits could be gained it is a question: the benefit to be gained would be by a confidential conference with Uncle Joseph to obtain from him advice and perhaps temporary assistance: if I were you I would not even call on Mrs. Child this time.

She and Eliab came home in Stage last Monday.  We've had a very pleasant time not withstanding a good deal of hurry & flurry as usual.  I told the folks that if you only had money plenty by you, would  be here too as suppose'd they would not object to a vacation your school is so long.  Joseph was home 2 or 3 weeks ago was about here a week buying things-etc etc.\nAlmeda and her two Daughters started the 18th of last month went on board the Boat the 19th.  Had a rough passage got into Boston the 21st.  Mrs Caroline Chase sent her sometime since a  very cordial invitation to come with all her children and spend the winter with her.  She will leave Lucy with her annt Rachel Thomson in Sutton perhaps to stay a year which she & Lizzy spend the winter writing about - Charles carried them to Bangor and see them aboard etc went with 2 horses.  He is always willing you know to do what is thought best  it cost him a dollar more besides his time and team but we all thought it best as it would be pleasanter for her.  Charles and Lucy had an invitation to attend a Scholars Picnic Friday evening at the Academy Foxcroft - so Anna & Eliab concluded to go too so Charles hurried  about all day borrow'd sleigh & harness and riggd in both horses and got started about 3 o clock calculating to spend the night there and this morn go on to Bangor.  Lucy goes back with them expects to spend the winter  there go to school and assist Ann - She'll write you all about it soon I guess.  I am dreadfully press's with work for little Jamie etc and need her help and her company but was very willing she should go - be for her good I hope with quite a benefit to Ann too - you enquire about a wedding - not very soon I guess Albina begins  a school in the Rollins district next Monday 2 month I have not been so inform'd but I guess that they would have been married perhaps by this time had it not been for the lack of the Rhino? poor fellow he is always in the mire struggling with all his might.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97754,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/97754","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d8538b5d06ee3d419bb4d7f0a37517b3.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d8538b5d06ee3d419bb4d7f0a37517b3.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d8538b5d06ee3d419bb4d7f0a37517b3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d8538b5d06ee3d419bb4d7f0a37517b3.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:32:51+00:00","modified":"2020-07-28T03:57:18+00:00","filename":"d8538b5d06ee3d419bb4d7f0a37517b3.jpg","authentication":"01f987334fd39d63150593379759b68e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_77_007_002_o2.jpg","size":1546914,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2860,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050081390831391},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["230620"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["230620"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["230620"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d8538b5d06ee3d419bb4d7f0a37517b3.jpg","FileDateTime":1587317548,"FileSize":1546914,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2860\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2860,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:27 13:17:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:26 23:06:20","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:26 23:06:20","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3131,"ExifImageLength":3941,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1235,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1235","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I could relate a long concatenation of circumstances the why, and wherefores (nothing very unusual however) but it is of no use - he is now again expecting a chance to sell the Grey but perhaps it will fail.  He has borrow'd money of Eliab to pay Everett & the \"Division\" but must get it for him again by 1st of Jan.  He has 6 or 8 tons of hay to sell but it is very low no more than 7 or 8 dollars serv'd - It is no small trial and mortification to me that we cannot send you some money.  \nYou enquire about Joseph and his business, I can't tell you much for he is not communicative - Sons and Nephews rather objected to giving him all the  wages he ask (have got the same Tom Boynton they had when Jo' went there for still less than Joseph had) but the principle reason of his leaving was his health - they asked him if he expected to make more than they would give him he told em no but he expected have longer time to make it in- his partner is a Mr. Fulsom a likely man, I suppose but has not much property I guess - They mean to trade in lumber furnish supplies & have begun in a small way.  Joseph went up to Boston & bought his dry goods I don't know to  what amount.  West India goods they get in small lots at Goss  & Upham and any more I doubt whether he'll make any more at present than at wages he needs, Eliab with him & will have in time perhaps - you speak of J as clear headed  foresighted & so he is - but not more so than E nor so much either consider the difference in age.  I suspect you & all of us have undervalued E.  He is not only shrewd but clear & deep beyond his years you know he is not twenty yet he can and actually does teach both Mrs Browns boys (& himself besides) in some things.  They carry on an immense sight of business & he is (Joseph says) the main spoke in the wheel.  Joseph is philosophical, curious and critecising -Eliab has more politeness more natural good feeling perhaps - more versatility and expansiveness of mind but perhaps I have not expressed just my ideas for lack of the right words.  You are as you say not much acquainted  with him.  I wish you were more so he would be perhaps as good a correspondent  as Jo if you give him the opportunity.  He is quick of apprehension and exceedingly sensitive - I suspect he has the idea that you don't price him quite so high as he deserves in comparison with Joseph.

9 1847\n\nMy Dear Son\nI received your hurried journey to New Haven - was very glad to know that you had return'd safe and well - not very well tho' I suspect - for the quick travelling and loss of sleep must have occation'd  great fatigue.  I should suppose you would hardly feel or look fit to be seen.  Am glad you call'd at Mrs Childs.  I have been somewhat apprehensive that A \"would wear her welcome out\u201d at Mr. Chases - I am not at all acquainted with him but your Father knew his family well they were very low.  He had no education - & it feels if perhaps  he is a man of few words.  Head down always.  Pretty good sort of a man but I guess he is a little close. lots  & lots of thanks for proverbial philosophy.  L has had it at Bangor till this week I presume She & Ann have enjoy'd it much -  It seems well calculated to make ones God grow into ripeness and the evil wither and decay - I have but just look'd at it but it seems to me lovely excellent -  many gems worth digging for.  So rich they stir up feelings within me that I cannot express or define but my intellect is dark so that a little light dazzles it I suppose.\nYou say you dread to go into your school again you should try to \"take it easy\" make it a pleasure to you as L does.  But after all the easiest way and the only easy way is to be every moment on the alert and see everything before it happens - tis much better to prevent than cure.  Charles always fail'd in governing a school I think by permitting small offences pass with impunity which would weaken his authority.  I presume you are a very good teacher but better for large scholars -  But I think it more important even, that young children be well taught than older ones.  Lucy seems to have a real \"gift\" for teaching.  She was applied to teach this winter the school she taught last Summer.  I think she has a fine opportunity at Bangor am very glad to have her there - tho' I miss her company very much and so does Charles - he thinks, she is one of a thousand says she is worthy of the very best man there is.\nCharles has been to Bangor this week says there is a tremendous excitement there with the rum sellers -Eliab has been very active in ferreting out and getting evidence etc and has the praise and gratitude of many of the first in society for his","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97758,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/97758","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c4c30f4047b1a667bc005439bf20ab43.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c4c30f4047b1a667bc005439bf20ab43.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c4c30f4047b1a667bc005439bf20ab43.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c4c30f4047b1a667bc005439bf20ab43.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:32:56+00:00","modified":"2020-08-05T19:40:38+00:00","filename":"c4c30f4047b1a667bc005439bf20ab43.jpg","authentication":"bcacbe8b4aef85903d17039dff95b8b1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_78_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1629397,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2961,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050952412223098},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180627"],"TimeCreated":["005709"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180627"],"TimeCreated":["005709"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180627"],"TimeCreated":["005709"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c4c30f4047b1a667bc005439bf20ab43.jpg","FileDateTime":1587317548,"FileSize":1629397,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2961\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2961,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:27 13:17:47","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:27 00:57:09","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:27 00:57:09","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3315,"ExifImageLength":4030,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1235,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1235","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Craft and fearlessness about it.

You wish you had Charles's oxen there I wish you had too for he has had no opportunity to sell 'em you know there has been no snow scarcely not enough to make sleighing about here except a very few days till the 28th of Jan. & the fright about the small pox had its effect too so that there has not been so much call for woods oxen as usual.\n       Charles thought it would'nt do to keep great oxen and not have them earn anything so he went off to work with 'em about 8 miles beyond the foundry (Hauling Shingle Stuff  & logs etc. for Mr. Hotman & Hector Sargent) has been gone 3 weeks. A week ago today old Mrs. Bickford died was carried to Charleston to be buried Mr. Kittredge had our horse - & Lo while the Father & Mother & Nelly &Charles & the Doct. were all gone Albina was taken sick (sooner than was expected) the Doct. was gone to the foundry but got back barely in time to bring us a nice Boy we expect C. home tomorrow what will he think eh! Lucy was gone to Bangor some expect her home tomorrow Miss O. Furber kindly consented to come and help me a few days till L. gets home. She went down with Sam'l was going to Hampden too to look at the House where she expects to live next Summer. I feel very well satisfied with her choice - am glad she has found a friend & just such a friend - but what shall I do without her She is such a good good girl - All- everything that a mother could expect or reasonably wish in a Daughter.\n  Notwithstanding I am pleas'd and glad to have her go yet the thought of it has already cost me many tears Ills that never happened you'll say\n\n15th  Baby is a week old today.

The V I was sorry to see! though it showed your thoughtfulness and dear brotherly kindness, for I feel that you ought not to send it. The \"braces\" I think would be very beneficial to me, and I intend to have them, if obtainable in Bangor, but the \"lining\" of your last letter I intend to return to you. I am so glad you are coming and do hope you will be able to be here a week or fortnight before the 17th, also I shall have no time to see you, hardly.\n\nMother is all ready - could go just as well as next week as any time, as for that. I feel really relieved that she is going - she will enjoy herself so much better than here alone with Albina all summer. 'Tis for the best good of all parties that she absent herself a while, I think. I believe Ann has written you all her plans - which by the way are not few - for coming home, when she wants you to be in Bangor to come up with them etc. I believe the last plan is to get a carriage and all come up together guests & all Sat. or Mond. previous. Ann is \"all agog\" as the saying is. Hope they will all realize as much enjoyment","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97785,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/97785","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/a6e99e0f5237f97b15437cec72e6056b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/a6e99e0f5237f97b15437cec72e6056b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/a6e99e0f5237f97b15437cec72e6056b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a6e99e0f5237f97b15437cec72e6056b.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:33:33+00:00","modified":"2020-08-07T01:29:49+00:00","filename":"a6e99e0f5237f97b15437cec72e6056b.jpg","authentication":"29452becaf50b41eb86647e89fc33718","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_79_003_002_o2.jpg","size":1718752,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2842,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.055997080824667},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["231302"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["231302"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["231302"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a6e99e0f5237f97b15437cec72e6056b.jpg","FileDateTime":1587317549,"FileSize":1718752,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2842\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2842,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:27 13:18:53","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:26 23:13:02","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:26 23:13:02","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3130,"ExifImageLength":3964,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1235,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1235","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"as they anticipate.

I think truthfulness, sincerity is a marked trait in his character. He has spoken of uniting with the church. We shall attend meeting at the Hall in Bangor, & he will probably join that church. Have I not great reason for gratitude to God for His many mercies, and especially for this.

I dont know how long I shall stay  Make haste and come home & I'll come up with you probably & had better not stay there very long. But I calculate nothing about it without knowing what Joseph is going to do. Tell me do you think he had better stay any longer there and in that Treatment I cannot ascertain that there is much if any improvement in his health. I suppose I dont know any thing about it, But it seems to me that having a steam of Water from 20 feet an inch in diameter poured onto him must be exceedingly painful, ? and exuuting to the system.

When he was taking those powerful stimulants last summer, it was considerable time after it was plainly evident to me and to him that it was injuring him before he would leave taking it and then not till he had written to Dr. Rich - when he had the same as told him that he didn't know what to do for him but he might by such & such things \n\n Now Dr. Prescott has told him that he thought the Water Treatment cannot help him and has written to Eliab to that effect. I feel so distress'd sometimes to think he is there alone for strangers to experiment upon I can hardly bear it. He needs a kind friend or Brother with him. He has an exceedingly refin'd and exalted mind - But I think you even dont fully understand him he is not (now at least) fit to judge for himself in every circumstance as Eliab would be.\n  I have all along thought his best chance if not the only one for him to get well was to be quiet & do nothing but wait and let nature alone conquer the disease.

There is also running through it a tinge of romance or something which constantly is not philosophy. The chapter on the \"progressive scale of beings in the universe\" exemplifies this, and may perhaps be characterized as a somewhat wordy paraphrase of the fine expression of the same idea in Popes Essay on Man, enlarging somewhat on the culminating thought.\n\n   \"From natures chain whatever link you strike,\n    Tenth, or ten thousand, breaks the chain alike.\n    Planets & suns run lawless through the sky,\n    Being on being wrecked, and world on world,\n    Heaven's whole foundations to their center nod,\n    And nature trembles to the throne of God\"\n\nExcellent idea's as poetry, and finely expressed in the Poem, but Sufficiently destitute of merit as Philosophy.

He reached home and died in four days. His father two hundred miles away in the woods, exploring, and they don't know where to send for him.

I was gaining very fast but during the hot weather that followed I melted down and lost my strength in a measure. It is now cool, and I think I am gaining again.

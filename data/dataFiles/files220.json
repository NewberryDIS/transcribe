As soon as it gets a little cooler: we will get half a hog & a quarter of beef and we will be fixed for Winter. Dave has done fine this Summer: he has got $2.00 a day right. along and is still getting that price.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":49187,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/49187","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e8791ea81800cfd72b3c41732bf50fa4.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e8791ea81800cfd72b3c41732bf50fa4.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e8791ea81800cfd72b3c41732bf50fa4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e8791ea81800cfd72b3c41732bf50fa4.jpg"},"added":"2017-12-08T15:10:46+00:00","modified":"2020-05-02T22:22:13+00:00","filename":"e8791ea81800cfd72b3c41732bf50fa4.jpg","authentication":"e5260801f2c54f828cf48ab08af91fd9","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_hurd_arno_box_01_fl_004_007_03_o2.jpg","size":1016132,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2344,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040139204904563},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160713"],"TimeCreated":["234450+0000"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160713"],"TimeCreated":["234450+0000"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20160713"],"TimeCreated":["234450+0000"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e8791ea81800cfd72b3c41732bf50fa4.jpg","FileDateTime":1512745366,"FileSize":1016132,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2344\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2344,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"13mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:15 11:51:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:07:13 23:44:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:07:13 23:44:50","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":37,"SubSecTime":78,"SubSecTimeOriginal":78,"SubSecTimeDigitized":78,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2188,"ExifImageLength":3359,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":220,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/220","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"He is very different to me than he used to be. - when he found out he couldnt have everything his own way it made a different man of him.

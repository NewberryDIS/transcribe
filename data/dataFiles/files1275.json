It must have been not far off though.  It seems you had quite a Thanksgiving at Milo after all.  I did not know whether the boys were going up or not.  I wanted much to go home, probably should if I had not been quite so poorunderlined.  However, now I find I have go to go on to Yale College, it is perhaps better, for now  I can have a vacation.  Next week. I guess I shall start Monday Dec. 21st, and go right on to Yale by Rail Road shortest route, be there Wednesday perhaps Thursday  also and get back the best way I can.

I had begun to get tired of writing so long, near five weeks since I wrote last. However, it seems you waited to announce the wedding. Well I am glad to hear of it, but sorry and some vexed that I cannot be there for the interesting occasion. I had a great mind to start right off and go, but I suppose it would not do at all: even one week less of these lectures, to say nothing of the absoluteness of the \"pecuniary negative.\"\n I suppose that at this time I am writing you there together, the girls, perhaps the boys too, returned home, and all enjoying yourselves finely.\n If I were ever in the habit of being otherwise than contented, and happy, in spite of fortune & circumstances, I really do not know but I should be, or want to be, 'homesick.'

I have got one of the very best and very pleasantest schools that ever was seen. I have about forty five scholars, and most of them very good ones, some very forward. About twenty of them are young ladies grown up, and such are altogether the best scholars generally, if one knows how to get along with them just right. They are easiest to govern, that is, if they need any governing; have a much better sense of propriety than young men generally, less of that stubborn independence in wrong oftener than right, which leads young men and their teachers into so much trouble. They are also easier to interest in studies or anything good, though perhaps to be fare, less likely to retain an interest if once excited, but with less to distract the mind. Most of my best classes are mostly young ladies. Another thing will perhaps amuse you -- my school is closed every day with singing! Pretty well, considering my musical capacities, is it not? The young ladies do it entirely among themselves, and it succeeds finely. Some eight or ten of them, are superior singers, the best part of two or three village choirs. I think it is a fine thing for the school, and pleases the scholars finely.

I suppose too that I could hire the money perhaps. I guess I could find those who would hire it tome. Guess old Frost in Topsham would, perhaps somebody in Bangor would; perhaps the Colburns here in Orono would; and, if I have my health and strength, and God blesses me as he has done, I could soon earn money and pay it. But, then, I am twenty five years old already; the most valuable portion of my life is fast passing away; and I ought not to be obliged to spend the prime of my strength, physical or intellectual, in some temporary employment to earn money to pay debts!\nStill, all that, one way or the other, does not trouble me much. I can earn money any time, or do without. What does trouble me, is -- What shall I do in the world? I ought to have some fixed object in view to lend all my energies towards. What shall it be? You might say the ministry-- but I am not fit for it, and in more respects than one or two; should not be successful in it, in any respect. I think I might be successful as a Physician or Surgeon; that my mind would be fitted for it, etc. perhaps. But it is by far the most expensive of all professions, to study as I should want to.

I had been in Brunswick six full weeks, and had heard never a word from there, although I had written two or three times I believe. However, perhaps I was glad enough at receiving the letter at last to make up for some of the waiting.  However if it is to be so long before I receive answers to letters, I think I do well to write pretty soon after receiving one.\nAs for my health, about which you always appear to feel so much anxiety, I have the pleasure of informing you that I never enjoyed better in my life. I am perfectly well, stout, rugged, and healthy, eat like an ox, and sleep accordingly; can tire out my fellows at most any thing, and not worry me; swim three hours per diem, (if I choose), and feel all the better for it.  On the whole, I study some, read more, and get along very comfortably, except when some unlucky circumstance slightly reminds me of pecuniary affairs; but even that, for one as good natured & careless as I am, never lasts a great while.  Did I understand you that you hoped I would have one severe fit of sickness just to teach me to take care of my health?!

Of all the enough country that ever I heard of it beats every thing. The road itself not very lively, but more crooked than ten Earhorns, away round one awful rocky, little hill, then leaping over to just such an then, to mind round to still another in the same way: and soon all day long! Not an acre of land to be seen! but still abundance of farming and orcharding, on little spots of Earth, mashed into hallows among the rocks & ledges. I got out of the stage at a Mr. M. Williams, the nearest point to Warwick village, following a map of \"Road to Capt. Joe's\" projected upon my note book by H. Stevens Esq. Uncle Joseph not at home, Greenfield. However, they appeared glad to see me. All well. Next day, Tuesday, 7th, I went up to Aunt Conants; staid all day. They are all well. Hervey has quite a pretty little wife and two children, and just going next day have now gone, all four, to Barnard, Vermont, to see Samuel. Aunt C.

I went with Samuel up to the other place, and up where Father used to live. Every thing seemed to look just as I could remember it, only smaller, narrower, and as if crowded up together, the houses seemed so near, instead of away off as I thought them. I went into the house, the Old Kitchen seemed so little. I suppose I remember it as it seems to me when I used to creep across its floor, and think it a long ways. Mr. Newton, who lives there has had a stroke of palsy, and cannot speak so as to be understood or hardly more about. The farm I guess is not very well cultivated, or any thing in good repair. They say it is exactly as father left it. No Improvement of course going backward. The farther part of the shed building is all rotted down, looks as if five pounds weight would crumble it. Samuel & I called at Mr. Russell Morse's, Sen. & Jun. My old playmate has two or three stout babies! The Old Man, Samuel said is Rich. We went back across. What a tremendous hill that is.

Her husband it seems is quite a wealthy farmer.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101897,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101897","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/18606ad895f18773adeffdccd959726a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/18606ad895f18773adeffdccd959726a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/18606ad895f18773adeffdccd959726a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/18606ad895f18773adeffdccd959726a.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:40:08+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"18606ad895f18773adeffdccd959726a.jpg","authentication":"a1737ea6de2b62b6bcd84b6cb08696d8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_160_007_008_o2.jpg","size":1610426,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2877,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051829516342898},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233551"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233551"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233551"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"18606ad895f18773adeffdccd959726a.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994751,"FileSize":1610426,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2877\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2877,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 11:59:41","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:35:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:35:51","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":16,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3181,"ExifImageLength":3980,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"8\nCol.

Why couldn't you tell me how the little fellow looks? Or has in that matter been decided yet?! It is a little curious that Charles should be away in the woods. Rather a great idea to find himself a father so unexpectedly. I do not see how he can go back into the woods again and leave his baby! It is a pity I had not his oxen here if that is all that sends him off. $28.00m per month thought I should think was doing pretty well, all expenses paid; that is, if he gets his pay.

I believe I much begin to write again to you and Lucy for it I want after writing once even till I receive your letter; the time becomes so long that I almost forget even writing before \"The Stormy March had come at last!\" After a winter of almost unexampled mildness, very little snow, no sleighing for a week together any time I believe, hardly any cold weather except a week or two we were out up to Brattleboro; March bids fair to be; at any rate had thus for shown itself, boisterous enough.\n\n Today had been real March weather: changing half a dozen times from bright melting sunshine, to dark gusty snow storms, and a wind that cuts like a knife, raising the snow in clouds, even as it melts under the high Spring Sun.\n    At the Monthly concert - this afternoon, Dea. Field from another town being present, gave an interesting account of a Revival, lately & now, going on in the town of Heath, west part of this county. \nA real Revival, like those of other days, which have been so scarce almost unknown for there or four years past. How it does warm ones' thoughts, so that, according to the Psalmist, the fire burns within, to hear again such doing of the Lord. I bought back to my mind the former days, at Brownville in 1842.\n Oh that the Lord would again vouchsafe to visit his people in Mercy to extend gracious influences of his spirit on every side. How careful too ought Christians to be lest they again excite the displeasure of God as in time past.\n The Churches about here, I think must be in extremely bad state; far worse than I know any thing about Down East. Many of them as I hear full of old breaches, divisions, wounds, & some that will not be healed up: often hearing called council after council, and every one leaning matters worse then before. This Church has been in the same way, and that long: difficulties now sleep perhaps only because there is not life enough to show it. As the man who is struck down by apoplexy does not complain of a foul stomach. As I understand from Mr. Jones, there has never been really a revival of Religion in this town! One of the oldest towns too. Mr. Field said that in Heath there have been 10 councils besides References in 10 years.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101904,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101904","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/68fe7ad3a6cefddb880c80c367124d9a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/68fe7ad3a6cefddb880c80c367124d9a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/68fe7ad3a6cefddb880c80c367124d9a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/68fe7ad3a6cefddb880c80c367124d9a.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:40:18+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"68fe7ad3a6cefddb880c80c367124d9a.jpg","authentication":"629426a60f9b8723b6dc933fb120b140","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_161_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1580001,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2332,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.062734300552697},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233656"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233656"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233656"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"68fe7ad3a6cefddb880c80c367124d9a.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994751,"FileSize":1580001,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2332\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2332,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:00:01","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:36:56","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:36:56","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":74,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3255,"ExifImageLength":5023,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Isaac Mar. 6, 1848\nThere are great times just now among the Irish laborers along the Rail Roads about here.

That is little enough to be sure considering that they may not be able to work more then 15 or 20 days in a month and their board costs them generally about $2.25 or more per week. But since March came in, and the wages not raised, they have had a general \"Strike for higher wages!\" all along on this Road and others simultaneously. Not content with stopping work themselves, you see, they undertake to all from working whether they wish or not; marching along the line sometimes three of four hundred together armed with clubs & pick handles, stopping the crews who did not strike, in some instances, destroying cards, shovels, etc. Most of the works about here stopped when the rest did, but as yet there have been no overt acts. Some think the mobs will show themselves here within a few days, to break up the crews who are still at work on the bridges etc. No one knows what will be.

He is a resolute fellow too.\n\nI think now I shall continue some way to get off here a week or two the last of April or in May. I rather think they will let me go, if they are not extremely and unusually hurried. I have certainly been very steady at business since I have been here and indeed am in such a situation that they owe it to me. Moreover, those with whom I have to do are the best  sort of men to get along with. Mr. Field my immediate director is a great friend of me, and ready to do any thing to oblige me; and Mr. Johnson, the Chief Engineer, has the reputation of being very obliging in such matters. To be sure, leave of absence for an Engineer is something not usual or to be expected. The universal answer to applications is No. If a Junior ever gets leave of absence it is a special favor. It is a kind or work that cannot stop and no one can take another place for a few days or a week. However, you may fairly expect Me; so of course Mother be ready to come back with me at once. At any rate to come.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101905,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101905","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/04ce18e907004e8063daba27a1e5f17a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/04ce18e907004e8063daba27a1e5f17a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/04ce18e907004e8063daba27a1e5f17a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/04ce18e907004e8063daba27a1e5f17a.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:40:19+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"04ce18e907004e8063daba27a1e5f17a.jpg","authentication":"f7f5689b1e6a9f9872d6373783e51f60","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_161_003_001_o2.jpg","size":1961567,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2863,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.063439250462478},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233710"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233710"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233710"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"04ce18e907004e8063daba27a1e5f17a.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994751,"FileSize":1961567,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2863\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2863,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:00:04","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:37:10","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:37:10","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3211,"ExifImageLength":4037,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"[Upside down at top] I believe 100.00 expense in orcharding, ten, perhaps even five years ago might have made Charles' property  1000.00 better now.\nDear Mother & Dear Sister Lucy, I have again got about tired waiting for a letter from you, and do not see but I must begin again to write in advance!  I believe it is pretty near a month since I wrote last. Does it begin to look any like Farming Down East yet? Folks hear abouts have begun to plough a little. and prepare Gardens, in dry situations. The frost is pretty well out of the Ground, the Road considerably settled, the grass is springing, the buds swelling. The rye fields, (rye appears to be a principal crop here) look beautifully Green.\nFrogs, snakes, and birds are abundant this fortnight. Blue birds are extremely abundant & little shy; Robins more scarce than in Maine. I think. Since the first of April I have been out of doors all the time, indeed of about half, and enjoy it much. There is prospect of rather a busy time next month; but then I am getting work done up pretty good jog, that is may be in a state of forwardness, so I can get away. Did you ever know any thing about this town of Northfield; Mother, when you lived in Milo? I believe it would be difficult to find any where, a more idle, shiftless, good for nothing, vicious, set of people than are to be found in this street. Mr. Fields, and he, like most perhaps who call themselves Unitarians, is really little better than an Infidel; Mr. Field ascribes the present character of the inhabitants to the \"preaching\" under which they were brought up. I think lately that might be the case. Did you ever know of, or hear of , \"Old Priest Mason.\"  He was dismissed from the Church here several years since, still lives here, but has never entered the Church from that day till this. I believe he is about as thorough an old Pirate as ever lived. Certain it is that his influence, and he has some, for he is a man of considerable ability, is entirely in opposition to a every good thing.

It may make you talk to me about being careful of my health.  Though in fact, I am never careless; in proof of which, I can say I have not taken a cold at all for the winter or spring.  I usually have a cold sometime latter part of the winter; but this year have entirely escaped; and my health has been perfect: ~ but ~ about a week since I had a sort of Nervous fever which lasted two or three days, in which time I did not sleep, and hardly rested still in one place one whole minute at a time. There was a terrible burning much of the time in my face, alternated by a dull pain among my teeth & cheek bones. Perhaps, you know I am a Hydropathist. Well, I could cure the symptoms quite easily by the regular water cure, laying cloths from cold water over my face etc. but I could not thus remove the cause, the nerves, and the fever would return. At last I got out of patience, went to the doctor, took a good dose of Chloroform, got pretty drunk, calmed my nerves down, went to sleep, and waked up perfectly well.  On the whole it was quite a fit of sickness for me. was not it?\n Isn't this an early Spring? or is it earlier here than in Maine? I picked a nice bunch of May Flowers today 13th  Farmers busy ploughing etc .\n\nAny sort of a decent horse is worth $100.00 here. 6 1\/2 fat cattle 90. to 100.

This Cutting down, \"razeeing\", a ship builder might call it, a man from \"second rate\" to \"third rate\", is not very easily estimated. Yet it is a think very easily done by a little too much of difficulties, or too little of advantages at a critical time. To be sure the man may yet be a very useful man. In some cases indeed he may get clear up again. With a really \"first rate\", this may be easy enough. When a man had really distinguished himself as a genius, he become a great statesmen, orator, author: they do not stop to enquire whether he got an Oration at College, or indeed whether he has ever seen a college. But with us Common men the case is very different. If the student was not quite high enough for a \"Phi Beta-Kappa\", nothing he can ever do afterwards will give him an Election and if he does not get higher than a \"Common Man's\" ambition ought to lead him, then will be apt to remember what he was not, rather what he is.

From the date it seems that it was written about a month ago. It is however little more than a week since I received it; it probably waited by the way some at Bangor or Hampden, and then as I had changed my residence, it was most a week after it arrived at Northfield probably before I obtained it.  I believe I have written to you once since your letter was written though I suppose you had not then received it. I guess I wrote before they moved me off here to Grout's: perhaps about the time I was thinking about Alabama! I guess I wrote all that story. Well Leonard went off to Alabama, & I was promoted to his place. No slight mark of confidence to be placed in a young Engineer, only a year old! to put him in such a situation.   It wasn't a very pleasant situation to begin with though. It is never a very easy business getting into another man's shoes. Engineering is perhaps most difficult of all business for that: and to Cap the Climax Leonard was about as hard a man to follow as could be found. I expect they put me here thinking I could along with it if anybody could! but I assure you it was a hard case for a spell. Much as ever I couldn't sleep a'nights for a week or two. I could not dream of anything else. However patience diligence perseverance etc. etc. are bringing order out of chaos in some measure, & the prospect is now pretty fair of getting along quite comfortably this winter: though I maybe a good deal hurried & perhaps worried for a month or two.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101923,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101923","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/490bf881ff061447fc793785e465831c.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/490bf881ff061447fc793785e465831c.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/490bf881ff061447fc793785e465831c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/490bf881ff061447fc793785e465831c.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:40:45+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"490bf881ff061447fc793785e465831c.jpg","authentication":"85eab467cf90f243a96f9b032117cdfb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_161_009_002_o2.jpg","size":1903533,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2867,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.061476475603612},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233907"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233907"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233907"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"490bf881ff061447fc793785e465831c.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994752,"FileSize":1903533,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2867\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2867,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:00:45","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:39:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:39:07","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3127,"ExifImageLength":3926,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"As for Politics, your letter was so long delayed, it did not reach me until just about Election time; If it had come sooner, I should certainly have written off as fast as possible to Charles upon that subject, for it really hurt my feelings considerable that a brother of mine should aid in the Election of such a man as Zachary Taylor. To be sure, it is no more than we must expect, that the thousands will be led around by by the nose, by party leaders, but then we do not like to see our friends served so.

You could hardly find a Mass. Whig who would not except for this one thing. Taylor is the Whig 'so called' Candidate; forty thousand it seems did not care even for that.\n\nTo be sure I regard Cass as equally unprincipled as Taylor,  but then I can but put infinitely more confidence in his future course. With all such men conducts depends upon influences, as true as ethics.

The trouble is, they go only half way. their advice is too general. they say \"Marry\": the question is \"whom?\" Lucy leaves me very much in doubt whether her preference would be for Olive Furber, or Lizzie Doe! What do you think of her taste? I do not know but my taste would be rather a hard one to suit: though after all I am a little inclined to think that there is not so much difference: that whoever the parties, the fault is one's own if not suited in the end. Characters are moulded to the circumstances & companions they meet with, in great measure, spite of Story & romance.\n      As respects Society & every thing of that kind, my position is certainly very far from favorable: it was bad enough at Northfield Since I came down here I have gone up to Northfield on Sabbath 9 miles, on Sat. night: but believe I shall go over to Montague only, 4 miles in future mostly. \n My present Post Office Direction is \"Grouts\" on Grouts Corner, Mass. \n\nPerhaps I better not tell you what sort of a place it is: nor how the Tavern, our boarding house, has 50 boarders, 20 beds, & a Dining Room that seats 15! However I am very comfortable. \"The Engineer\" has a large room, perhaps the last in the house. It is R.R. Office, filled of course with Drawing tables, books, tools & paper, & has two beds, one for me, one for my two Assistants. But you know we do as we choose, furnish us or room with whatever we like, & Vt. & Mass. pays the bills! The great thing for me, plenty of best Sperm Candles.\nOne thing Grouts is better than Northfield; it has no idlers. \nDo write soon, frequently, often.\nLove to All,\nWrite me about all.   JJvJ?

Being stuck here at Grouts not very well, a rainy Sunday etc. I have been writing to Anne, from whom I received a nice letter yesterday and to Lucy who I suppose likely by this time is at Milo to spend the winter mostly. To prevent me from doing or feeling worse I believe I will continue the business by beginning at least a letter to you.\n As for you apprehensions of evil in my behalf, I guess there is little reason. The \"Glory\" of being at Grouts I should hardly think could injure any one. As for health, it is very possible that since being here, I may have somewhat overworked body or rather Mind, and am just now feeling the natural reaction. At any rate I feel rather dull stupid & sleepy for a day or two. I expect I have got the Jaundice a bit. Notice that I look about as yaller as a yellow dog today, and about as dull as a  beetle.\n\nthis Jaundice is a disease indigeneous to this Miserable Miller's River. At any rate prevalent here. something perhaps in the soil, air, or water. I do not like the place.  \n\n  Ann certainly seems to be very comfortable & happy in her new & far off situation. I judge from her letter that as a Teacher She has a better situation than she ever has had before.

I presume that it will be strictly followed: though my predecessor got married here! to a sister of the tavernkeeper's wife who waited on the tables ignorant & coarse too. but so was he in many respects.\nReally though I begin to \"take it to heart\", among the Multitude of Councilors. Not only Lucy & Samuel, I could get round that; but you & Joseph, and now even Anne, away from Wisconsin.  What shall I do about it.\nThe fact is; (I do not know but I am little too nice about it: as my misfortune has always been in every thing else to have my tastes far above my means) but I really do not know of any body that I want. There may be some that want me: but that is quite a different matter.  There was a young lady in Turner that I could have liked considerable, perhaps did; but she was engaged to a young Engineer before I ever saw her; a friend of mine, and I couldn't in honor \"cut him out,\" as the chaps say. They are Married, a year since, I couldn't go to the wedding: was? in N.H. He is Sec. Eng. on the Portsmouth & Concord R.R. She is a grand woman, & one of the best friends I have got any where. She had a sister younger & prettier I suppose than \"Nancy\"; who was perhaps designed for me: A very good girl too: but then I never liked her as well as she me. I never repented much more of any little accident, than I have of kissing her cheek one particular time. It hurt me when I heard how she cried when I did not go back to Turner to teach the next Fall.\n\n I do not know as there is any body else in all \"Down East\" that I care much for. Josephine of Topsham too, whom Anne once recommended to me, was engaged to my particular friend Morse, before I ever met with her.\n\nI have certainly met no very \"bright particular\" Star since I have been in Mass.

When I was at Warwick, Uncle Joseph complained of you for not writing, and accused you of \"getting lazy\". I took it upon myself to deny the charge quite indignantly: but I do not know but I shall be obliged to \"retract\". if you do not write to me better than lately. To be sure I do not know but I am partly to blame myself. Not being an \"original genius\" or having like Joseph any original ideas. I can only write letters by answering the letters of others. Of course my letters are apt to be directed to those who wrote to me last. \n\nI believe I have been a pretty punctual correspondent to Joseph and Lucy who wrote to me usually pretty punctually.\n\n I have not much to write now that will be of interest. The life of an Engineer, though to be sure full of variety, is of that kind of Minute Variety that hardly bears copying or transferring to a letter. Perhaps it would be called a monotonous variety. \n\nOne may ride or walk a few miles farther one day than another meet a few more folks, or be a little more hurried, quarrel with a contractor or agent one day, and find him good natured and obsequious the next; but it is all hardly worth telling of.\n\n I am really rather pleasantly situated here this summer.

Is there any such story, and what is it, and where does it belong?\n Do you know any thing of the whereabouts of a young man named J.M. Metcalf? I have ordered him to appear here forthwith, but he does not as yet show himself, or say when he will. If he has taken refuge with you, or is harboured in your region, I wish you would send him along here immediately.  I will do him good when he gets here, riding around the country etc. etc. I usually ride 15 to 20 miles per day. Keep the use of one horse all the time. and can have another when I want, and will if he will come.\n\nThe R.R.Co. Allows me $1500 per Month extra for Horse Hire.\nSpeaking above of female society, there is one Lady in Goffstown I intend to get acquainted with if possible. She is an Old Maid probably 40 years old, is wealthy, highly educated, accomplished, travelled, and moreover has been extremely beautiful, has the most magnificent & sweetest eye I ever saw, and I form a very high opinion of her from her Sabbath School Class.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101933,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101933","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d91261b6b9b689c39c1606bc8f610726.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d91261b6b9b689c39c1606bc8f610726.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d91261b6b9b689c39c1606bc8f610726.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d91261b6b9b689c39c1606bc8f610726.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:41:00+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"d91261b6b9b689c39c1606bc8f610726.jpg","authentication":"cd0c2efc03663688c33fc9f76e912cac","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_162_011_004_o2.jpg","size":1786661,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2828,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058497727748965},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234035"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234035"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234035"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d91261b6b9b689c39c1606bc8f610726.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994753,"FileSize":1786661,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2828\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2828,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:01:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:40:35","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:40:35","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":83,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3168,"ExifImageLength":4032,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"[left-hand side] I dont think I feel\nThe Minister here is a brother of Austin Willey, Editor of the Maine Anti Slavery Standard; was a Class Mate, I think Room Mate of Swan Lyman Pomroy at Andover.

I can not get away now on account of some Masonry which require constant looking after to have it done right. If I get that fixed up right after the First of August Work is done up, if nothing else comes up which is probably, perhaps I can get away for a week.\n As for Joseph, I think he reads writes & thinks too much. Why can he not be contented to simply enjoy life without vexing his brain for any thing just for one season Load round, ride about and lie in the sun not read & write all the time.

I have a Report, Plan & Estimates of the Survey to make out, which I find is no small task.\nEven if I should succeed in crowding through that, there is getting to be quite a pressure of other business accumulating upon my hands: the Final Settlements with the Contractors and varied other matters which Everett did not dare to undertake, and which have been growing these two or three months.\nAt any rate I intend to come home; so you can expect: but mind not to get impatient, or look for me: if I do not come till Spring Even.\nI believe, Mother, I write this letter, not because I have any thing particular to say or write; but mainly to enquire why you do not write to me. Really Mother, it is quite a while since I have seen one of your good old fashioned letters. Joseph writes, and you  you perhaps stick in a bit in one corner somewhere;","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101937,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101937","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/de900cf6d60ab8eea310a38e3d0867fb.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/de900cf6d60ab8eea310a38e3d0867fb.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/de900cf6d60ab8eea310a38e3d0867fb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/de900cf6d60ab8eea310a38e3d0867fb.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:41:05+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"de900cf6d60ab8eea310a38e3d0867fb.jpg","authentication":"635c0da5e57d9da77373a72ddf16d6c8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_162_013_002_o2.jpg","size":1706105,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2912,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.054248861670737},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234102"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234102"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234102"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"de900cf6d60ab8eea310a38e3d0867fb.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994753,"FileSize":1706105,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2912\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2912,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:01:18","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:41:02","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:41:02","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3201,"ExifImageLength":3956,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"but it will hardly do to call such a letter.\n\nI think you ought to do better.

But I cannot stop to write more now, So good bye. & do write soon\n                                                                              Affectionately\n                                                                                              I.S.M.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101949,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101949","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/94dc878c2a45aaa34e89c56101e668d7.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/94dc878c2a45aaa34e89c56101e668d7.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/94dc878c2a45aaa34e89c56101e668d7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/94dc878c2a45aaa34e89c56101e668d7.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:41:22+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"94dc878c2a45aaa34e89c56101e668d7.jpg","authentication":"cc981df80462e1647f721181a9ed9a8c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_162_017_001_o2.jpg","size":1841129,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2891,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058967453271327},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234228"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234228"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234228"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"94dc878c2a45aaa34e89c56101e668d7.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994753,"FileSize":1841129,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2891\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2891,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:01:53","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:42:28","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:42:28","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3160,"ExifImageLength":3934,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I.S.M.

Jan. 5, 1850\nDear Mother\n\n   I received your kind letter yesterday I think after expecting it a good while. Of course I need not say how much good \"Mother's Letter\" always do me.\n I am really glad to hear that you are going to Hampden, for I do believe that you will enjoy a visit there. I am by no means sure that you ought not to spend most of your time with Lucy. You could not help being happier with her than with Albina.  If so you certainly should; for I know of nothing in the World to confine you in any place, but where your children are. I believe you think you are growing old. Now I think moving about is much more essential for Old folks than for the young: they ought to spend their time mostly in visiting their children.\n Did you ever hear of an old proverb that Mothers always like their daughter's husbands better than their Son's wives? Isn't it somewhat true?\n\nIf so you had better live with Lucy much of the  time until I get married. But I intend some time to get a wife so superlatively super excellent you will be so pleased with her as to want to live with us most all of the time! I hope you will not be too impatient for the time to come! for I hardly know where to find her yet, and I want of course to be very sure.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101950,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101950","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/db205325686dc74d2d34431487b2f34b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/db205325686dc74d2d34431487b2f34b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/db205325686dc74d2d34431487b2f34b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/db205325686dc74d2d34431487b2f34b.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:41:24+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"db205325686dc74d2d34431487b2f34b.jpg","authentication":"6541ddb5d3a44fbdfe893e39f49aaccd","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_162_017_002_o2.jpg","size":1920349,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2896,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.061398512635564},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234235"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234235"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234235"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"db205325686dc74d2d34431487b2f34b.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994753,"FileSize":1920349,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2896\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2896,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:01:55","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:42:35","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:42:35","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3189,"ExifImageLength":3963,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"About Joseph, I agree with you entirely that he is too apt to adhere to the advice of his physicians rather than to consult his own feelings: Moreover I do think that Douchs injurious to him, and I wrote to him immediately to that effect; I guess he thought so himself.\nI am quite flattered to find that this great German Doctor, who is really celebrated, coincides with me in the course of treatment he recommends for Joseph.  quiet, freedom from fatigue, gentle applications of Water. If he does stay there at Waterford, I think Joseph had better by all mean remain there, perhaps for a year. If Dr. Munde does not stay there, I have very little opinion of Prescott, and I want Joseph to return to Milo or Hampden, remain, quiet, pursue the Water treatment very gently, and wait.\nI repeat, as I have always done, that his cure must be effected by rest, quiet, and by time.\n\n I have lately heard of two cases of injury to the spine, apparently worse originally than Joseph's, which by mere time without treatment, Eventually recovered.  A Nephew of Putnam of Dunbarton many years since, was totally disabled bu an injury to the back worse than Joseph's; was two or three years unable to move his limbs at all, at least half a dozen years unable to do anything at all, but gradually recovered, and  fully, so that he is now one of the smartest men there is any where.

You will readily perceive that in most of these I can afford him some assistance so as to get along faster and better, and we expect to have him get well right away.\n Moreover sine the Botany Books came up he is going into the study & examinations of Plants & flowers right and left diligently.

It rains so hard this forenoon that I do not undertake to go a long way for the uncertain prospect of very poor preaching, from an Old School {which I do not like} Presbyterian from Kentucky.  So here I sit in this little old \"Chester House\" with the Mighty Missippi (it is certainly mighty now) washing to doorstep and porch; and thinking, thinking of you all Down East. How I do want to hear from you. I seems as if it had been several ages since I left Bangor, and I have not heard one word from any of you since I started.  I have been writing to some of you about every week. A fortnight ago from Chicago I sent off quite a package of letters. I wrote some at Springfield a week since but thought I need not send until I get to some fixed point. I mailed a letter to Bangor on the Steamboat Thursday I think, and one to Milo, since I reached Chester.\n\nI am detained here at Chester some three days. My destination is out East of here in Perry Co. some 50 miles or more perhaps from here on the Prairies. I believe I wrote to Eliab and to Milo to direct letters to Locust Hill. Letters so directed will doubtless reach there. It is the name of the place where our head quarters are to be probably; But the name of the Post Office I find is\n                                                                Mt. Hawkins, Perry Co. Ill.\n\nThe safest direction will probably be to Care of B.G. Roots Esq. Mt. Hawkins, Perry Co. Ill.\nThe name of the County you know is a essential requisite in the direction here.\nWhether I shall stay there more than a Month or so is very uncertain.  I cannot tell how I shall like, or what kind of a situation I shall have. I have to begin with only the promise of $65.00 per Month & expenses. If I stay shall probably have up to 100.  If I find the Climate does not agree with me I shall not stay at any rate. Southern Illinois has sometimes been considered unhealthy,  but it is probably only from the character of its population.  The section where I am going is considered one of the healthiest in the State in all respects.\n\n I came around here from Caledonia on Thursday last.

You would say enough to use up one completely at the East, one who had not been on a horse for 1\/2 doz. years perhaps.\nBut it did not hurt or tire me at all. They have splendid saddles out here, stuffed and quilted as soft as a Cushion, and then the saddle horses, trained to a gait, sort of Canter, very different from a hard trot.  They ride horseback almost altogether here, single wagons or buggies being very rare, and the roads used almost entirely for two horses very hard footing for one horse in the middle\n\n  I enjoyed the ride very much, beautiful country; part of the way along to high bluffs in sight of Missippi River; Corn 6 to 10 ft. high just travelling out, and  some only just out of the ground, Wheat mostly cut and poorly shooked up in the field.\n\nAbundant orchards, especially of peaches, some cherries. Road sides abounding in big blackberries which I could pick abundantly without dismounting.\nHowever there are some Evils, probably lest the country might be Paradise.\nIn the bushes every where abound what they call Wood ticks, much like a sheep tick, with a little white spot in the middle, who adhere and bite considerable.  None yet are what they call \"jiggers\" a little red thing about as big as the point of a Needle, found I learned to my sorrow among blackberry bushes etc. who burrow into or under the skin, occasioning considerable burning itching & pain, and a hard lunch or blotch, like that of a mosquitoe on a stranger, only much more so, and sometimes getting all over one.\n\n I was going out to Perry Co. Sat. but could not get fairly started and so wait until Monday, which makes rather dull staying here.\n\nEve. I have not been at Church all day today, in account of the rain, much black Illinois deep mud, long hill to climb etc. In fact I am told there were but 10 out this A.M. and even the minister did not go this P.M.  I have slept most of the time I believe!\n\n   My health is very good. The weather for a week or two past has been about the same as our warmest weather in N.E.  I sweat profusely as usual, and am much of the time very thirsty.  I do not know whether from drinking the river water, from restraining myself from drinking as much as I desire, or from the food of the Country, which is universally most abominably too much salted. The Main article of food is Bacon every where in Illinois, the whole half hog salted & smoked in a side, always very salt. And at public houses, steamboats etc. they make the beef just so salt! And drink Coffee, Coffee in vast quantities strong as lye, three times a day Coffee & Bacon are two necessaries of life to regular sucker. The two skillfully combined make fever & ague I expect.\n\n[at top upside down] It is now June 29. I think it will not do to send this letter till after July 1 and the new Postage Law is in operation. You must write to me when you find out where I am. I believe I shall direct this letter to Bangor expecting that you are there now with Lucy, Mother.

Dec. 8- \n\n~ Dear Mother - How glad I should be to have you all upon Isaac's suggestion, and come here with Percie. We are enjoying ourselves and well as we could possibly have expected. The thoughts will come sometimes how happy we should have been- how happy little Mayo and Willie would have been - and then I am astonished & grieved at myself that I should for one moment lose sight of their far greater bliss & joy in the bright home above.\n Little Wilder is ? and happy all day long. He had only four teeth - has taken three or four steps alone, grows fat and strong every day though I do not think him any stronger now than before he was sick. I am so glad Percie is so well - Raspberry leave and pumpkin bread seemed to be very Effectual. Isaac seems much better than when we came here. I did feel very anxious indeed about him. I feared he would be really very sick before he would be well. It was wonderful that he was not much sicker after so much care. Anna is just as good as can be - she comes over almost every day & Hattie & Libby come after, and altogether we have nice times. The black spot to me is the thought of Isaac's going away. I should really take great comfort in thinking of the winter if this did come up so often before me, and I do not mean to be unhappy about this either if he is only well. I should think Samuel's rooms must be very pleasant. We found a number of things nice & convenient that were not changed - spice box etc. Samuel is very thoughtful & kind.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101980,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101980","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f2c7a014b0d7beffb71c4b4b165e2800.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f2c7a014b0d7beffb71c4b4b165e2800.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f2c7a014b0d7beffb71c4b4b165e2800.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f2c7a014b0d7beffb71c4b4b165e2800.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:42:04+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"f2c7a014b0d7beffb71c4b4b165e2800.jpg","authentication":"decd73b306b76e2f3443add1111dfdfb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_164_004_001_o2.jpg","size":1767610,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2718,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.060216185648489},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234634"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234634"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234634"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f2c7a014b0d7beffb71c4b4b165e2800.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994755,"FileSize":1767610,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2718\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2718,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:03:14","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:46:34","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:46:34","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2982,"ExifImageLength":3949,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Isaac\n                                                                                                               Elyria Lorain Co.

Aug. 8 1858\n\nDearest Mother\n\n  Your letter came to hand yesterday; and we were all gladdened thereby.  I had been about writing to you for some days; and upon the strength of your letter will try to do it at once. I cannot perhaps answer your letter exactly, for Anna carried it off to show to the Judge.\n Anna's letter it seems you had not received when you wrote. I expect she, and perhaps all of us, have been a little remiss about writing of late; some of us will try to do so better in future.\n  We are sort of dull here of late. Jenny went home last week. Emily was married a week ago. We got another girl before Emily left, whom we expected to like, but she was taken sick, spitting blood, I expect she danced too hard at Emily's wedding. Anna's 'Katy' is about sick upon the same grounds. So we have had no girl for almost a week: expect one tomorrow.\nThen Nettie & I have both been about halfway sick.

But while we have two girls, he does not need to.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102004,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102004","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e4f40b8a1c4efcc8f6bcd518deecc026.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e4f40b8a1c4efcc8f6bcd518deecc026.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e4f40b8a1c4efcc8f6bcd518deecc026.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e4f40b8a1c4efcc8f6bcd518deecc026.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:42:38+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"e4f40b8a1c4efcc8f6bcd518deecc026.jpg","authentication":"c05a0fc18b0f9e3f43303395bcd94943","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_165_002_002_o2.jpg","size":2047892,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2911,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.065139000216293},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234919"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234919"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234919"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e4f40b8a1c4efcc8f6bcd518deecc026.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994756,"FileSize":2047892,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2911\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2911,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:04:14","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:49:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:49:19","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3229,"ExifImageLength":3992,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I wrote you that Old Mrs. Dolittle died before I got home.

That made my visit at Dunbarton rather short. I arrived there at 10 P.M. Wednesday, and staid till 8 A.M. of Thursday. Got home Saturday. Found all well here: both the children still fatter & stouter than when I went away. Nettie had not been very well, the care of the heavy children was too much for her; and she had to get an other girl, a little one, to take care of Charlie for her. Anna & her folks are quite well I believe. Old Mrs. DeWitt died last week Tuesday and was buried on Friday.

A cold biting wind next word underlined: poured ? down the gullies of the mountains, causing us to pull up over our ears the collars of our zamarras, and scattering the ashes from our cigars in our word like the sparks of a furnace.

Now the summits of the lofty peaks became distinct & the ragged outline of the chain, those nearest to us fringed with snow weighed pines, The sun bursting out at length in all its power & majesty threw its glittering beams upon the walls of snow which throwing back the reflection dazzled the eyes until they were unable longer to look upon the glorious picture.\nOften as I have seen the sun rise in many diferent parts of the world, I never have been so struck with the natural beauty of such a scene, as this morning.  I well remember the feeling of gratitude nay devotion to nature for providing so joyeous a spectacle to her children, which took possession of me.

In most places, between the track and the precipice, there was a ledge of snow of some 4 or 5 feet broad, beyond this \u201cfacilis discensus averni\u201d.

Yet attached to the Polish Lancers.  right margin: 1\nAfter a few days spent in San Sebastian, I determined upon commencing my journey into Navarre, to join, if possible, the French Legion which I understood was to be met with either in that province or in Lower Aragon.\nHere I concluded the purchase of a horse and mule, paying of course for my whistle.  I also secured the services of an Aragonese as a servant, one Manuel Arteiza, as big a rascal as his country ever produced, but an excellent criado, and honest I do believe to me, although at war with the rest of the world. My intention had been to have gone round by Santanda & Bilboa, and so by the Ebro and Logro\u00f1o into Aragon or Navarre.* A foul wind, which had lasted many days and promised to continue foul as many more, however prevented the Chasse-Mar\u00e9es from putting to sea.  I therefore lost patience and started off one morning at daylight by Passages and word to Bayonne.  From there skirting the Pyrennees, I passed Toulouse, Pau, & Oleron i.e., Oloron, from which last place I provided myself with a guide and extra mule, in order to cross the somewhat hazardous pass of Urdos into Spain.  An unusually severe winter & great quantities of snow rendered the passage exceedingly difficult, and I was strongly urge to wait for more favorable weather.  This however with my usual obstinacy, only determined me the more strongly to proceed, and one evening I found myself and caravan halting at the miserable Inn in Urdos which is the last civilized halting place, before entering the pass of the mountains.  Here we heard alarming accounts of the difficulties we were to enter upon in the morning.  The paths, bad enough in all times, were now completely blocked & hidden by snow, the least deviation from them would perhaps bring us down a precipice.  The wolves also were down from the mountains in great numbers, and many tales of devoured travellers and other horrors, were poured into our ears.  Manuel, scratched his head, opened his mouth, ejaculating Jesus Maria \u2014 Jesus Maria while my Oleron guide, albeit an old draughter, and used to the Mountain passes all his life, shrugged his shoulders, and it required an extra dollar or two to induce him to undertake the journey.\nA bota of brandy was added to our stock and other creature comforts provided, and leaving directions to Manuel to call me an hour before daylight, I turned in.\nNext morning when I rose, I found the guide and Manuel preparing the chocolate and frying some ham and eggs.  The people of the house snoring in their different beds in the kitchen from one of which the daughter of the house, too lazy to rise, was pointing out the locale of the different articles required.  Into her hands as she lay half asleep, I was requested to pay the cuenta, and with a mumbled prayer for our safety  from the old landlord & landlady in one corner we sallied out.\nIt was a piercingly cold morning, the sky clear and bright with countless stars.

He was beating the snow with his feet in short  jerks, turning round and round, bemoaning his hard fate, and uttering a sentence every now and then of an ave Maria, or pater noster.  His companions, were speechless with fright, or frozen into dumbness by the unexpected announcement of the arrival of the old gentleman..\nAs however I saw that something must have caused the sudden fright of the mule as well as Miguel, I dismounted from my mule, and wading through the snow crept under the belly of the leading mule, for I was unable to pass, and advanced a few yards before him.\nThe track here was gradually ascending, and here and there a mass of rock almost filled up the narrow path.

Ingress or Egress was alike impracticable.  The morning dawned without a prospect of relief.  The leaden murky air seemed laden with snow, the fall of which in steady flakes was uninterrupted by a breath of wind. Everywhere around, and in startling propinquity resounded the howling of wolves driven to the enclosures by extremity of hunger.  When Miguel made his appearance accompanied by one of our hosts, they at once pronounced our departure impossible for that day.  We therefore made up our minds to pass it with our present entertainers.\nOne of the men was dispatched to the nearest hut for a supply of black bread, without which he found the tough bear meat was anything but palatable.  Our mules suffered the most for there was nothing for them but very little of the coarsest hay and the little corn we carried with us.\nAll that day I remained out in the air, for the filthiness within which was in some measure hidden by the night now appeared with all its morning horrors.  My party too, in no way more fastidious than their countrymen, shared with me my disgust and together we breakfasted outside the hut, and at night I betook myself to the stable where in the manger, wrapped in my cloak, I enjoyed a tolerable night.\nDuring the night I was awakened by a terrible din amongst my four footed bed fellows, caused by the onslaught of a gang of wolves on the pigs and poultry.  The mules were the first to give the alam, and the first howl also brought to the scene the large mastif, who quickly siezed and word one, until one of the Cagots came up and dispatched it.

The redman sees with dismay the gradual but certain encroachments of his white supplanters in the lands of his fathers.  As the forests ring to the axe of the sturdy squatter so does the game forsake its accustomed haunts.  The handlike track of the bear no longer rejoices the sight of the Indian hunter.  The deer forsake their licks -- the raccoon & porcupine fall & are extinguished with the noble oak and hickory; their hitherto safe abode.

At any other season they are nearly stagnant, unless an unusual quantity of rain or a freshet on the lake causes them to flow.\nIn winter these creeks being frozen afford an excellent road into the woods, and they are generally chosen by the Indians as a spot near where to erect their temporary camps during the winter hunt.\nAlthough the different nations are now so mixed & amalgamated, as to render their interest effaced:  the same yet in the Indian Country without the settlements, they still have their distinct hunting grounds; any encroachment on which by a different tribe, is considered an infringement on the law of the woods, and occasions not infrequently much dissension and bad blood amongst them.\nThe spot selected by my party, which consisted of six Indians and myself, was on a creek running into the lake, at a distance of 50 miles from the nearest clearing.  It wound in a serpentine course, many miles into the woods, and at the distance of about 15 or 20 miles from the lake shore, ran through some fine tracts of timber land which is called in the language of the country a beech ridge.  This tree always prefers ridges of high land, and a lighter or sandier soil, than is found in the lower lands.  Here the game is always plentiful, the deer loving to browse on the young saplings, the wild turkey feeding on the nuts, and the bears generally choosing the hollow of a beech tree wherein to ensconce themselves during the rigours of winter.  The beech is also the chosen quarters of the black squirrel, which little animal often varies the venison or bears meat dinner of the Indian or White hunter.\nArriving on this creek after several days journey from Lake Erie on the banks of which we had followed our fall hunt, we fixed upon a space of about fifty square yards of crossed out: elevated open ground, formed by the sudden bend of the creeks and surrounded by a wall of lofty beech tress.  Here, for the first two days we formed a temporary shelter of branches, whilst we occupied ourselves in hunting and laying in a stack of venison to supply us during the time we might be engaged building our shanty.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64481,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/64481","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/03ba52aabb2430fe16b93aa1689b138e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/03ba52aabb2430fe16b93aa1689b138e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/03ba52aabb2430fe16b93aa1689b138e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/03ba52aabb2430fe16b93aa1689b138e.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:01:25+00:00","modified":"2020-01-28T22:44:24+00:00","filename":"03ba52aabb2430fe16b93aa1689b138e.jpg","authentication":"aaad0b7ed03b28cfa007342c2382eb5c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":89,"original_filename":"GR_3614-2_0053_o2.jpg","size":1650722,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2330,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.065598553489111}},"item":{"id":994,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/994","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"On the night of the second day we took possession of our new abode, a little shanty 7 ft high -- 10 ft by 8 -- formed of rough logs and with a roof of bark, at the apex of which was left an open space for the free egress of the smoke.\nA small square hole, of sufficient size to allow a body to pass, and covered by a deerskin formed the entrance -- and the chinks between the logs were stuffed with moss & clay to keep out the freezing air.

We presently heard the snapping of twigs, and noise of some animal bounding over the brittle twigs, and soon three deer leaped across our path, a fine buck leading at a tremendous pace.

However, he told us that he had seen some raccoon tracks not far off, and he might perhaps succeed in finding & killing one of these animals.  The anticipation of roasted 'coon, soon put us on the track, and following our Pottawatomie guide a short distance through the woods, he pointed to a log, at the top of which there was still a little snow, and where the luckless raccoon had imprinted his not to be mistaken track.  However, the ground was so intensely frozen, that on leaving the log, no traces of our game was perceptible even to an Indian eye, and dispersing, we sought a long time in vain, in different directions, for any evidence of the fugitive.

As the snow would render the hunting excellent, I was anxious to return to our camp, but the Indians were determined to wait until the Great Spirit was propitious, so finding they were not be induced, the next morning before daylight, I shouldered my cross and returned alone to the shanty.  I was in sight of it when I came upon the tracks of three deer, which had passed only a few minutes before, and though the daylight was fast waning, I followed them until the track led me to a ridge of beech saplings, where I discovered the deer browsing.  I quickly levelled my rifle at the nearest, and killed it -- brought it to camp, skinned & cooked a collop for supper, after which  much fatigued, I slept soundly until morning.  On leaving the hut the next morning I found that several wolves had been round the deer, which was hanging on a gallows, and had carried off the head & neck.\nThe next day I had a long hunt.  The deer were wild, and though in great numbers, were difficult to approach within shot; so that after following some for many hours, I found myself far from camp, and evening already closing in.

I at once set it down as a wolf, the eyes of which, it is known, shine in the dark like a cats, therefore cocking my rifle, and throwing it forward into my arm in readiness, I approached cautiously the spot where I fancied the wolf might be standing watching me\nHowever, as I drew near, the beast did not seem to change its position, the speck of light appearing in the same place, but as I approached I thought it grew larger.  At length, somewhat doubting I quickened my step towards it, when I saw more of the same light, and presently many sparks flew into the air.  I was now convinced that the light proceeded from my shanty, through the crevices of which the flickering light came, but as I most certainly had extinguished the fire before leaving in the morning, I was unable to account for it, expect by supposing that some Indians had rekindled it.\nApproaching the shanty as noislessly as I could, I soon percieved that a roaring fire was blazing within; & creeping up, I looked through a chink in the wall, and beheld a sight which did not altogether delight me.\nSpreading his hands over the fire, sat an Indian, in the well known dress of the Pottawatomie.  So motionless was his posture, that for some moments I percieved it was a sleeping figure.  He sat opposite to where I was looking, so I had a good opportunity of inspecting him.  He was a tall powerful looking savage with his naturally swarthy face, rendered more striking by lines of red paint which crossed transversely his whole countenance.  A picturesque sort of turban, of red cloth, in which was stuck a single feather, covered his head, while a shirt of deerskin (but a sorry covering from the cold of winter,) confined at his waist with a belt in the was the usual hunting knife, and leggings of the same, with moccasins completed his costume.  No sooner had I caught a full glimpse of his countenance, than I was aware, that my approach had been heard by him.

He was one of the best rifle shots I ever met with, and with my rifle performed many wonderful feats in fine bead drawing.  He was also a good hunter, particularly after turkies: which he never failed to come up to if once on the track.  A turkey hunt, which we had together, was very successful.  One night he returned to the camp with a fine gobler, and told me that a flock of thirty were roosting that night on a beech ridge, within a mile of our shanty.\nAccordingly some hours before daylight we were on the ridge, waiting quietly until the morning broke, when the turkies would leave their roost.  The Indian had seen them take wing for the trees the night before when he had killed one, and not far, he thought, from the shot we then were.  In the interim we lit our pipes sitting quietly on a log amongst a thick clump of beeches.  Just as day was breaking, a rustling in the branches of a tree over my head roused me followed by a loud clear call from the same tree.  It was instantly answered by another, at a little distance, and taken up by the next, until the woods seemed to resound with the noise on all sides.  The Indian, at the first alarum, had pulled me behind the log, where with rifles cocked, we awaited our opportunity.  It was just light enough to enable us to look along our barrels, when a commotion in the same tree from whence the first call proceeded warned us to prepare.  Now, as the light first disclosed the top of the tree to us, we saw a large dark body descending from branch to branch occasionally uttering a loud cluck.  When it came to the first branches, I could plainly see the figure of a large turkey, and was on the point of firing at it, when the Indian restrained me.  I soon found the wisdom of this proceeding, for as soon as the bird hopped to the ground a few loud repeated calls brought the remainder of the flock one after the other, running swiftly over the snow & contrasting with their shiny black plumage.\nTwo or three had joined the old gobler, when the Indian motioned that now was our time: so levelling at the father of the flock, I laid him sprawling fluttering on the snow, where  another victim was also soon fluttering, shot by the Indian.  The reports of the pieces did not appear to alarm the others, for my companion putting his fingers on his mouth, soon brought them trooping up, by his own ? emulation of the call.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64489,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/64489","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/07b454b3afb55f85e5e265b4020596fc.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/07b454b3afb55f85e5e265b4020596fc.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/07b454b3afb55f85e5e265b4020596fc.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/07b454b3afb55f85e5e265b4020596fc.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:01:33+00:00","modified":"2020-01-28T22:44:24+00:00","filename":"07b454b3afb55f85e5e265b4020596fc.jpg","authentication":"caf20d6a7f7e2bd858fdd2ff2309bde7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":97,"original_filename":"GR_3614-2_0061_o2.jpg","size":1585538,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2256,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.06507494418177}},"item":{"id":994,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/994","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"11\nCrossed out: Captured in a day.

With but one blanket to cover me, I often felt the cold very severe, particularly when it was drawing towards morning.  At this time the fire would be gradually becoming lower, and we always felt too chilly or too lazy to doff our blanket and seek some more wood to replenish it.  During the night awakened by the cold I would draw my blanket over my head and crouch near the fire and lighting my pipe would enjoy a good roast.  Having imbibed sufficient calories, I would brave the freezing air, and turn out for a load of wood.\nAs soon as the wood burned up, throwing a cheerful blaze for some distance into the woods, and revealing the slumbering forms of the Indians, rolled in their blankets, with their feet to the fire. One by one they would rouse up & their pipes in mouth, occasionally looking up as the falling flakes of snow hissed into the blaze and the sighing of the wind over the tree tops  gave fair promise of a fine hunting weather.  Knocking the ashes out of their pipes, without speaking they would again seek their freezing couch, and their heavy regular breathing soon proclaimed they were once more in the land of dreams.  The last hour of darkness, when a faint greyish mist seems to tinge the sky, the forerunner of the coming dawn, is known to every one whose lot or choice may have prompted him to pass a winter night under the hospitable canopy of Dame Nature as the most intensely cold of the 24 hours.  At this time the half frozen hunter is roused by the searching frost, and crouching to the fire is dismayed by seeing only the smouldering embers of what was a few hours before, a blazing bonfire.

This time firing at two which were in a line, my ball passing through the body of the first, broke a wing of the other, which instantly set off at a word pace, followed by the others, not however before the Indian had turned over a second.  Loading as quickly as possible and leaving the four dead birds hanging on a tree, we soon followed on the tracks of the birds which left us far behind, although the long slinging trot led by my companion brought us up to the wounded bird which was lying panting & bleeding on the snow, where he had sunk exhausted from loss of blood.  In the evening  towards sundown, we again came upon the flock, this time feeding in apparent security, but two quickly succumbed to our rifles, thus making a bag of seven of these magnificent birds.  When we had collected the slain, we found we had enough to do, to carry them all, but staggering as well as we could under our load, we reached the camp after sunset, and feasted on part of one of the birds.  \nTwo or three days after, I had a close view of the remainder of the flock,  which had fallen a victim to their stupidity in an Indian trap or pen.  I had followed several tracks for some time when I suddenly heard a tremendous uproar a short distance ahead of me.  Hastening on, I came upon a turkey pen, which some of the Indians had formed, & which had entrapped 11 fine fully grown birds.  These silly fowls are taken in the following manner.  In a part of the woods, where turkies are known to resort, the Indian or White hunter forms his pen.  It is merely a square inclosure of rough logs about 6 feet square and 4 ft in height, th top covered in with smaller logs, with an interval of 6 or 8 inches between each \u2014 At the sides the lower bar is wanting, leaving a space clear from the ground of 18 inches words.  A train of Indian corn is then laid from different parts of the woods, leading to the pen, which is strewed with the corn.  The turkies coming upon the trains follow it, pecking it up until they reach the trap, when, entering they quickly devour the remainder.  When all is consumed, they attempt to find an exit, but all their endeavours are exerted to get  out at the top, through which they thrust their long necks, but without attempting to escape by the way they entered.

After a painful parting with you and our friends we retired to the cabin which we found nearly full of Irish Dutch or English, who were preparing their supper, which they spread upon the cabin table and eat with much apparent enjoyment. We took tea with the Captain whom we found to be quite a jovial sort of a man. he told us that he was going to take his wife on board, as soon as he came to his farm which lay on the banks of the river, and give her a sail for her health, and she would be some company for us. We did not, however, reach the farm before night and were thus deprived of the lady's society. Her health not permitting her to venture out at so late an hour. The steamboat on which we sailed was called the Commerce and at that time had five boats in tow which were well laden and prevented our going fast. We retired at an early hour with severe headaches which after a night of sound sleep was entirely dispersed. \n19th When we arose we found that we had proceeded but unknown toward Troy, You will remember that when we left N.Y. we unknown rain at least every other day.

Will you alow me to examine your \ndress a little, I used to be a dress maker and meant to have got me some patterns\nbut I forgot it? Oh! Yes. She then looked and measured for about 10\nminutes and then went away without thanking Miss S for being so \npicked to pieces. The weather was very warm & pleasant in the afternoon\n4th When I woke I found the boat was just leaving a place called \nBig river. About noon we landed at Cleveland Ohio. but could not \nsee much of the place except a few cottages on the hill. I spent the day in\nsewing and finished off my checked dress. About sunset we arrived in \nDetroit where the boat lay all night. In the evening we all walked\nround the City. There are some very handsome buildings and some of the\nstreets look very pretty but I did not like the looks of the place much.\n5th very pleasant.

Mrs M is a lady who formerly\nlived in Springfield opposite GrandPapa's. it now thunders \nand I am fearful we shall have rain tomorrow. Good Night\n28th I woke a bout 5 and found we were going to have a very pleasant\nday for traveling, we took breakfast and were on our way by 1\/2 past \n6. Every thing is really delightful now the sun is shining very warm\nand bright and is melting quite a heavy frost which fell during the\nnight which is the heaviest frost we have had for two or three weeks the\nprairie hens are so chilly as to allow us to ride quite near them of which\nthere are hundreds and they keep an incessant cawing. The Prairie devils\n(a bird) are so numerous and the sand hill Cranes which make a great\ndeal of noise these birds have bodies about the size of a turkey but\ntheir necks leg & bills are 3 times as long. besides these there are among smaller\nbirds which are singing and chirping very hapily.

I hope it may thus end but I have some doubts. After \nthis Papa and Olliver went over to the claim. The day passed with us as usual. Mama did the \nhome work Caroline growled whined & stormed at every thing for she has got to be the spoillist little thing \nI ever saw Dick played and teased Caroline to jig his horses and when she would not do it he appealed to \nMama, with 'Can't that child do it?'

Louis did not come in the evening as he agreed \n9th I got up about breakfast time feeling no better, about 8 we saw Louis coming down with a \nsmall white keg under his arm. After talking a few minutes with Papa he went into \nCharles and got our little red keg and then came in with them both he sat down as if waiting \nfor the vinegar. Papa asked him where were the yokes? I give you my word you shall \nhave them says Louis. I shant disturb the vinegar till I see the yokes said Papa. After \ntwo or three minutes though Louis went out and when he came back said the yokes \nwere out there, and that instant Charles came along saying in a loud tone. here are the \nyokes Louis and you had better look out for him or watch him. Pretty times too if a \nman must be watched for he will touch his own property. As soon as Charles said that \nPapa walked to the door. before this though Mr. Hill came in with a couple of fowls \nand was standing on the heart a looker on. Papa then took hold of one of his yokes \nwhich Charles immediately grabbed by the other and and tried to pull it away \nLouis then walked out and took Charles part, and there was too against one pulling\nthe yoke  Louis then began to get mad and told Papa if he did not go and\nmeasure off that vinegar he would put the whole out of the house quicker than\nlightning and if he did not let go of the yoke he would smash him. Papa\ntold him too do either if he dared, but, by this time Mr. Hill who can whip\nmost of the men around here had Louis by the arms or shoulders Charles of course\nwas calling Papa all the names he could and Abby (shame for her) was holding\nher own brother by the collar of his shirt with a tight grasp though not for a long\ntime for she gave up her frightening posture at the wors.  \"Let go of me\".  Mr. Hill soon\ngot the yokes from the whole of them & Papa & Louis who was now cool again went\nto measuring out the vinegar.  When Papa first said he must have the yokes\nbefore he measured the vinegar Louis said he must see the vinegar measured first\nso to know how much there was he thout? Abby said they ought to have 71\/2 galls\nas there was enough put in in the first place to make twice that amount.  Papa\ntold him that Abby knew nothing about how much there was put in he told him\nhe could have half of what there was in the barrel and no more.  it might\nbe more than 7 gall or lbs.  he told him they had used out of the barrel just as much\nas they wanted and so had we and thatsome had leaked out in the cellar\nas Louis had to give up getting half of what there was in the first place.  There\nfound to be 5 galls lacking1 qt per piece.  Louis took his and went off and Mr.\nHill delivered the yokes to Papa.

In the \nafternoon Uncle Charles & Aunt Abby took a stroll? round the farm. Charley was \ndressed as nice as you please but Aunt A had on one of those indigo blues spotted \nwith white and Mama's old hood which we sent out here. I should think she \nwould be ashamed to wear it for my part. After they came back the children \nwent to walk so Caroline & Dick, thought they would go too. when they came \nback they had some wild flowers which they had gathered which were very pretty. \nThe day has been very warm and pleasant toward night, I went out to the \nstocks and walked round a little looked at the calves & which looked \nfat and well. Before Papa went away Davis told him, there there was a man \ncame yesterday and drove away one of Papa's steers saying that it was his.  At night \nwhen Olliver came home Uncle C. took much pains to come and tell him \nthe same story.

He said too that if one of his Oxen should \ngo off and be gone a fortnight, he would not take his oath that it was his Ox for \nthere might be one exactly like it somewhere else, All these speeches and many \nothers the unnatural anxiety he show a about the steer struck me as being \nvery suspicious and I have a notion that Charly is at the bottom of the \nsteers going off. After Charly got through Erastus came and talked on the \nsame subject, repeating what Charles said about his being shown them &e\nErastus said it was the strangest thing he ever heard of for the man \ndescribed the marks on the steer which were just like those on ours (By the \nway I believe he had them described to him first) I think it is the most \nsurprising that Erastus thinks so strange of it for last summer they had \na yoke of steers go off and they heard of a man that had them, Erastus \nI think went too see them. When he came home he said they were as \nnear alike as they could be and he should think they they were the same but the \nman said they were not, and they afterward found their steers somewhere \nsomehow, put it all together and it looks suspicious.

Nothing disturbed us however. This morning Olliver \nhad to go to Mr Fritz for some potatoes, so Mama got him to go to Mrs Bothers? \nwho is in unclear and got me some Lobelies?. After he got back and brought \nit and went to the claim to plant his potatoes I went to work with fear& \ntrembling to take it. I took a tea spoon full in warm water which I had \nno sooner swallowed though it put me in a violent pain which lasted scratched out  \nshort time. I was to take another spoonful in 15 minutes if the first did not vomit me \nbut I could not muster courage. in about  an hour I commenced vomiting, it brought \nbile as though it had gone too the spot?.  but I took so little that it did not vomit \nme much. I have been sorry ever since that, I did not take any more. It is the most \npowerful stuff that I ever took it makes one feel sick to the ends of their fingers and \ntoes When I felt smart enough I read Shakespeare. Mama washed. Caroline and \nDick spent most of the day in playing out of doors. Dick took his wagon and \ndrew wood &  chips for us, he goes whistling along, or trying too so happy as anything. In the \nevening I commenced reading Waverly aloud. Olliver went into Aunt Abbys \nToday the court sets and I have not heard that Charley has got Papa off of the jury yet \n12th  Today after eating a slight breakfast I dressed to go to the claim on old Charley \nwho Oliver saddled and bridled. I  rode over as far as the saw mill with Olliver \nwho went on foot. here I left him to gallop Charly to see how I liked him. I think he \ntrots a littler easier than Jim and gallops  about the same though he is not so \nwilling to gallop as Jim is , he seems to prefer trotting, when I got to the claim I \ndismounted  to look at my garden. I found my unclear in bloom, my daisies \nblue bells sweet williams  &c doing first rate, my Rhubarb or unknown as they call it \nhere had leaves on it as large as my hand. my surge and columbine too were \ngrowing finely and my boxwood is all full of new leaves. I have 6 roots of it \nmy rose bushes and pinks do not appear to have started at all I am afraid \nthem and the grapevines will die, after I had looked at the house which has one \nend all sided and the paint on the other I proceeded to Mrs Stevens. After hitching \nmy horse I went in and took off my things. he did not seem to like to stand in the \nhot sun very well all saddled so Mrs Stephens told I had better take off his things \nand let him loose in the yard for he would do no hurt. I according did so, just \nat the moment Mr Gould A man that was at work for Mr Stephens came \nfrom the spring with a young rattle snake he was about 2 fingers long, he would \nstick up his tail and try to rattle though he had no rattles to rattle and then he \nwould jump at us and try to bite. My horse stayed round in the yard very peacibly till \nabout noon he took a notion to jump over the fence and was over and half a mile \noff before we could say Jack. Mr Stephens immediately set off for him but, as this was the \nfirst time he had been loose since last fall so that he felt extremely antic and \nit was a long time before they caught him finally he ran down by our claim and Mr S \nand Olliver above him under some stables where they caught him. Mr S then brought \nhim back tied him and then started for the teritory where he is at work cabinet \nnailing.

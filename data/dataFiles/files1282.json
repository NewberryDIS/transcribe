I shall probably come home sometime the first or middle of next week.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102840,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102840","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T00:37:30+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:26+00:00","filename":"17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg","authentication":"611d128ace857e86b6c4c2d2a7e56635","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_184_015_002_o2.jpg","size":1292181,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2415,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049543018173453},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["032613"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["032613"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["032613"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg","FileDateTime":1595810207,"FileSize":1292181,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2415\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2415,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:30:18","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:01 03:26:13","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:01 03:26:13","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2079,"ExifImageLength":3098,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1282,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1282","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Beautiful weather exceedingly, and I enjoy it all the more for getting a nice letter from you today.\nSunday & Monday, After a week of very fine weather, was a great rain.

Dec. 7  1863\nILLINOIS.\nDearest Nettie\n\n I most always write to you When I am here on the Sabbath Day, whether I do other times or not. Yesterday I did not happen to have any pen or ink. But, Oh how I did want a letter from you. I really expected one Saturday but it did not come.\n\nYesterday was Episcopalian day.

Could be if I had several times as long to stay.\n\nMr. Keyes comes up every day no matter what the weather is. Now a days it is really quite an under taking 5 or 6 Miles of Illinois Mud roads. Two creeks to cross - by fording. Nearly swimming they are too now. One or two days this week they were so. Last night was another great rain Mr. Keyes came up this morning before Six Mile Creek got up. To night it is undoubtedly swimming deep, but he went back just at night saying he could turn his horse out on the side and there was a big tree fallen high across the stream that he could cross in.\nMr. Keyes' health appears very good, he has had no cold or cough all winter, and I think looks stronger than I ever saw him.\n\nHe eats but twice a day ever nowadays. Comes up here in the Morning, and eats nothing till he gets home at night.\n\nI hardly know whether I shall get down there or not. I have not much time to spare certainly.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102884,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102884","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/dc28cf6c88ab44654e123465e3f5c5a8.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/dc28cf6c88ab44654e123465e3f5c5a8.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/dc28cf6c88ab44654e123465e3f5c5a8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/dc28cf6c88ab44654e123465e3f5c5a8.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T00:38:25+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:26+00:00","filename":"dc28cf6c88ab44654e123465e3f5c5a8.jpg","authentication":"96b096cb242fa76edf67947e8e0bb283","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_186_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1439990,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2315,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057594992400608},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033309"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033309"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033309"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"dc28cf6c88ab44654e123465e3f5c5a8.jpg","FileDateTime":1595810209,"FileSize":1439990,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2315\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2315,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:32:06","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:01 03:33:09","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:01 03:33:09","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":57,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3129,"ExifImageLength":4865,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1282,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1282","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"This evening I called around and had a long talk with Aunt Sally, - Mrs. Root. \nShe is very well this winter, apparently better than usual for some years, and just as happy as ever she was.\nIt was enough to do anyone - a christian at least, good, to hear her talk of Anna, and of her death. \nShe did not mourn at Anna's death, rather rejoiced - could have shouted with joy when she died, or as she lay dead in the house. Her very coffin, and her grave more a joy and a pleasure to her. She was a joy and a pleasure to her while she lived, and she had been ever since.\nBy the way, some one ought to write Aunt Sally's life. You know she was with her husband, first pioneer in all this region. He came out her[e] to establish a ferry on Muddy river, on the old great Shawne[e]town & Kaskaskia Trail. That was in 1819. There was no St. Louis then you know hardly .  The old French town of Kaskaskia was the end of the world in this direction as it were. and its outlet was through here to the Ohio River at Shawneetown. The nearest white family or person was 12 miles either way to the ferries on the next rivers.\nShe said last night she had lived night after night by the week entirely alone, no other human being within twelve miles; and why should she be afraid to stay alone in her house now with kind neighbors within call on either side. She had no patience nowadays with folks that complained of hardship and disagreeables of living in this country. \nI mean to get home Friday or Saturday next though I expect I shall have to go by way of Chicago which will take a little longer.\nI hope to get a letter from you Monday.\nSincerely\nIsaac","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102885,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102885","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/1cedf874f7788463492d4c0fb02b86f5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/1cedf874f7788463492d4c0fb02b86f5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/1cedf874f7788463492d4c0fb02b86f5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1cedf874f7788463492d4c0fb02b86f5.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T00:38:26+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:26+00:00","filename":"1cedf874f7788463492d4c0fb02b86f5.jpg","authentication":"22830a8dab794edb22b3d849be3533ef","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_186_005_001_o2.jpg","size":1507522,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3600,"resolution_y":2519,"compression_ratio":0.055413009277638},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["003919"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["003919"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["003919"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1cedf874f7788463492d4c0fb02b86f5.jpg","FileDateTime":1595810209,"FileSize":1507522,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3600\" height=\"2519\"","Height":2519,"Width":3600,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/16.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:32:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.2,"FNumber":16,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 00:39:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 00:39:19","ShutterSpeedValue":2.321928,"ApertureValue":8,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":44,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3395,"ExifImageLength":2376,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1282,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1282","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY.\n\nNo. 1.]  Terms and Conditions on which this and all Messages are Received by these Companies Respectively.\n\n  In order to guard against and correct as much as possible some of the errors arising from atmospheric and other causes appertaining to telegraphy,  every important message should be repeated, by being sent back from the station at which it is to be received to the station from which it is originally sent.

Saturday night was the \"Elder's Meeting.\" It was a little curious to see how anxious how many were have their own voice heard in relation to their experience in ruling the church. So they adjourned to try it again some other evening.\n\nYesterday morning I visited two Sabbath Schools, and heard Rev.

Not worry and tire yourself visiting about at a thousand and one places all summer; but go there to George's. where you can have the whole benefit of the bracing sea air and just take your time for it, all summer. And I will try and arrange to come after you.\n\nA great trip today; special train, 6 last Cars on the R.Rd Gen. Assembly 200 and about 100 citizens of St Louis.

A great Iron Furnace by arrangement just ready for a blast ~( the running out of the melted Iron) which is quite a sight for one who has not seen it; and then the Climb up the Mountain which is just a big pile of solid Iron about 600 ft high; upon the ragged tops of which the picturesquely grouped party first sang America, then listened to sundry speeches of Welcome, and glorification, and description of surroundings, and of the battle ground in the plain below; then a prayer from the grand old Scotchman Dr. McCosh, singing etc. Then down the Mountain Pacific Dinner; and I guess there was food enough for a regiment of a thousand men. Visit the battle field & back to St Louis by 6 P.M.\nThe N.S. Assembly is expected to adjourn on Monday next I may possible go to DuQuoin on Saturday, probably not however till Monday. I do not mean to stay there more than a day or two.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102909,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102909","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f2cd0ae3699c38c7e901fee87aeced8f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f2cd0ae3699c38c7e901fee87aeced8f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f2cd0ae3699c38c7e901fee87aeced8f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f2cd0ae3699c38c7e901fee87aeced8f.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T00:48:33+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:26+00:00","filename":"f2cd0ae3699c38c7e901fee87aeced8f.jpg","authentication":"00e37e10e39b8df9857c3e0b55ff2dfa","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_187_010_001_o2.jpg","size":1196602,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2234,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049595560197619},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033724"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033724"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033724"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f2cd0ae3699c38c7e901fee87aeced8f.jpg","FileDateTime":1595810900,"FileSize":1196602,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2234\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2234,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:33:13","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:01 03:37:24","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:01 03:37:24","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1950,"ExifImageLength":3142,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1282,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1282","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I.S.M.\n\n                               St. Louis\n                               May 26 '66                      St. Louis Mo.\n                                                                               May 26, 1866\n\nDearest\n\n I believe I have written to you about our excursion to the Iron Mountain.

It is the same man that was a party to a celebrated \"Breach of Promise\" case a year or two ago. A Miss Carstang recovered of him $100,000.00 for breach of promise.

June 23, 1866\n\n[right-hand upper corner] Isaac June 23 1866\n\n My Dearest Nettie\n  Your letter of Thursday Eve came to hand to night to our great satisfaction. I had heard from you before, Mr. Finn getting a letter this forenoon written at Schenectady, telling of yr safe passing there, and of May's being sick. I am suspicious that it was occasioned merely by riding backwards, in the cars.\n\nI ought to have thought of it when you got in the cars. Perhaps simply the riding backwards from here to Cleveland might have disturbed the stomach, and she did not get over it all day; while if she had started right she might not have suffered. I am afraid you were too tired and ought to have staid in Boston, and rested a day. Am quite anxious to hear of yr safe arrival at Yarmouth. I mailed a letter Thursday Morning, and another Friday Morning, and hope you have got the first one tonight, but probably you will not until Monday. Wish I could look in at the Parsonage and see you this evening. You need not have been a bit afraid of May's being sick in the night. She probably slept all the better for the sickness, and it will not hurt her a bit.\nI wrote you of the \"Festival\", I think. I have not yet heard the results. But it was a frightful storm that eve. About the greatest storm, thundershower - ever known here. And to night is another one somewhat most like it. It is exceedingly wet here I assure you.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102918,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102918","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/0e4408ae189313c99a7d93618e91c13a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/0e4408ae189313c99a7d93618e91c13a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/0e4408ae189313c99a7d93618e91c13a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0e4408ae189313c99a7d93618e91c13a.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T00:48:45+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:25+00:00","filename":"0e4408ae189313c99a7d93618e91c13a.jpg","authentication":"c9d1356e8ce620c23eb8c8024d06f047","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_187_014_002_o2.jpg","size":1550722,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2873,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049977504479767},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033856"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033856"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033856"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0e4408ae189313c99a7d93618e91c13a.jpg","FileDateTime":1595810900,"FileSize":1550722,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2873\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2873,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:33:34","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:01 03:38:56","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:01 03:38:56","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3106,"ExifImageLength":3891,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1282,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1282","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Now I think of it, If you should happen to see Rev.

Great Democratic Victory!\n\nVery shrewdly managed by the Dem. leaders who are getting the Irish etc. in fine training for the September State Election. Election was from 10 to 2 oclock. Not a word of opposition, no demonstrations & ordinary light vote then, till half past 1, when about 90 Irish etc almost the full strength of the Democratic Party began to come in and vote in solid phalanx, Bill Whalan; Jim Wogan, Pat Cullin and all. Decent men mainly were at their dinners, and it was too late, (Polls necessarily closing at 2) to make a rally. The result is quite a relief to me. I did not feel at liberty to refuse to serve, while it is a tax any one may well rejoice to be rid of, And to be defeated in that way is really more of an honor than to be elected by an ordinary light vote. I was  pleased at one thing, when Irish began to come in, Judge Burke happened to be in the court house, and came in and voted right saying, \"Why I wanted to vote against Metcalf on that school government question, but I certainly can't today.\"\nSabbath \nYou may put your mind very much at rest about the children.

The letter I wrote to you yesterday forgot to go to the Post Office this morning, on account of my morning nap. So I will write a bit more and enclose therewith. \n\nSo you were at Bath last week.

I may not come at all.\nPerhaps we will let little Anna go over to Mr. Twiss' awhile this week to see how she gets along over there and whether Little John get along without her or is lonesome & fretting for her.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102948,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102948","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/64f70190164dba727b4e55491216221a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/64f70190164dba727b4e55491216221a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/64f70190164dba727b4e55491216221a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/64f70190164dba727b4e55491216221a.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T00:49:27+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:25+00:00","filename":"64f70190164dba727b4e55491216221a.jpg","authentication":"78940fcd9f76391c40a46c1b98d450e3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_187_024_004_o2.jpg","size":1361240,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2911,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.043298090257898},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["034218"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["034218"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["034218"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"64f70190164dba727b4e55491216221a.jpg","FileDateTime":1595810902,"FileSize":1361240,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2911\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2911,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:34:41","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:01 03:42:18","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:01 03:42:18","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":15,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3094,"ExifImageLength":3826,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1282,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1282","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Would it not be the best way for you to make out your visit alone this year, stay as long as you like, if we are all well, perhaps come back with Samuel, when he comes - of if that does not suit, get George to come to Boston with you - you paying his fare - and frm there you could come alone well enough couldnt you? And I will make my visit alone next year. I shall want to be at Old Bowdoin at Commencement next year at any rate. Twenty years class meeting you know.\nIt is not just the thing to leave such a family as ours alone with any body a great while. Eliza is just as good, as any body could be, perfectly faithful & trustworthy; would take any pains or inconvenience whatever to do every thing just right and care for the children the best she knows. But after all I guess you would a little rather trust them with me here, and I know I should with you here. The best way after all is to travel enmasse the whole family, children & all. I think we shall eventually have to adopt that plan. When the children get a little bigger perhaps. What do you think of the whole matter? Call for the previous question?\nI was going to send you some money in this letter. If you go to Pembroke Wednesday, this will not get to Yarmouth before you leave there.

I wish you would try to think of ways in which you may show this new love in your heart to those around you. One way certainly is by being more gentle and kind at home and at school and wherever you mingle with others.  And also by being firm as a rock for the right and against the wrong.  Show that you know what you believe as well as in whom you believe.

Viceroy Bucareli approved the expedition in September of 1773; and early in 1774, Anza and Father Garc\u00e9s, accompanied by another missionary, Father Juan D\u00edaz and 20 soldiers, set out to establish a land route from Sonora to the port of Monterey. Such a land route, desperately needed for transporting supplies to the settlements in Upper California, had previously been considered unfeasable because of the Gila and Colorado Rivers and the desert beyond. Anza\u2019s diary recounts the difficulties of the journey, such as harsh terrain, lack of food and water, and the possibility of hostile Indians. He describes the Yuma Indians in great detail, finding them affectionate and generous. The travelers pass through the Colorado Desert, the San Jacinto Valley, and finally reach the San Gabriel Mission on March 22, although Anza continues on to the presidio in Monterey arriving April 18. The group returns to Tubac on May 27, having traveled 594 leagues, and pronounces the expedition a success. Throughout his diary, Anza comments on the physical terrain, distances travelled, flora and fauna, characteristics and customs of the various Indian tribes, and the mission settlements. <a href=\"https:\/\/webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu\/nby\/cgi-bin\/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=121656\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View catalog record<\/a>","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":41,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/41","name":"Description","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"A missionary's overland expedition to California.","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":46,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/46","name":"Relation","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Spanish","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":44,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/44","name":"Language","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1191","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":43,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/43","name":"Identifier","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"To transcribe","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"19.1","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":38,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/38","name":"Coverage","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/3f229007edb825224b718d6fe8a4f0fb.jpg","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":48,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/48","name":"Source","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"19","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":55,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/55","name":"Percent Completed","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"019100","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":56,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/56","name":"Weight","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}

They meet many friends from America. Our weather has not been very warm but beautiful, there is a great deal of driving on the Boulevard, the Carriages and Phaetons are by three and four abreast of afternoon. I drive down there with my boys, they on their pony and large horse, and Hunt and I in the Carriage. It is very delightful to meet friends on the road and on Saturday we go over to Lincoln park. They have Music, so has our south side park, but Lincoln Park has so many animals and amusements, and we like the Lake Shore drive. I dress my boys so pretty that every one admires them, and they behave so good, and are so friendly with people. They are fat and rosy.  Sept 1st, 1873.  Only think of it how near the time is for us to meet our lovely daughters. I intend to go with Hunt and Sheridan and wait until they return at Long Branch. My sisters have returned from their trip to the seashore and will stay with Mr Badger, Shreve, and Mattie Sheridan at my house until I return. Mr Badger can't leave as he intended as Sam Walker has drawn and owes the firm of AC & OF Badger so much money that Mr Badger must watch it. He did it in Mr B. absence before so I will go on with Mr Chas Angell, Sheridan, and Hunt and meet them. \nSept 1, 1873.  We started this afternoon for New York with Mr Chas Angell. [[strikeout:  Miss Mattie] Sheridan, Hunt and myself. We had beautiful State rooms or drawing room all the way on, everything passed of delightfully. Mr Angell very very kind, we reached New York on good time in the morning. I could scarce wait for the cars to get in.

Sheridan and Shreve did not think much of their breakfast. We got on the cars and reached the branch at 12 o'clock, took lunch and walked over the grounds. I had two rooms on floor above the parour, it is so late and cool that many have gone. The band of music left the day before we arrived. We went down to the edge of the Ocean and children played in sand. After dark we stayed a little while in the parlour and then went to bed. I occupied the back bed with Hunt, Sheridan had the front.  Sept 4th 1873.  We arose early this morning took our breakfast and hurried down on the beach to get pebbles in sand. Waited until 10 o'clock and saw the people bathe. Did not go in myself. Enjoyed our lunch. Went again down and piled up sand. I bought Hunt a bucket and paddle. Mr Fisher came to see me. So did Mr Angell. I wrote home today. We walked on the piazza of the other Hotels. I like Long Branch, I have been here before.  Sept 5th  It is raining, so I will write. We can also walk all about the long parlour and play the piano. Hunt took quite a fancy to little Ferris, blank, he spoke such good English. We took him up in our room and had a good time of it. After lunch it cleared off and we all went out and enjoyed the sand. Saw a full rigged ship it looked superb. Sheridan took a notion to bathe, so I let him, but he only stayed in a little time and declared it was too cold. We walked out to the stores to buy baby some stockings, returned late to dinner, had a fine dinner boys are so happy.

I am so sorry I have neglected my journal for two or three years. I have lost the best part of our lives and I regret it, as it was so full of events that belong to the young ladies, for they have lived a very gay life and received much attention. Invitations have been numerous for them to ride on horseback, concerts, parties, Opera,s Croquet parties, Sleigh rides and all kinds of gaieties, they have had many charming Beaus, and we have travelled a great deal. We visit every winter our Louisville home. They always give us a large party. We visited Lake Geneva in Wis. enjoyed a few weeks there. Mattie Faulds and Octave with us. The boats and fishing my little boys enjoyed. The lake is very pretty and clear it is nine miles round. The drives down and up on the hills is beautiful. Everywhere you turn you see the lake, many people have summer homes there. We have visited Waukegan, Lake Superior, Marquette, Green Bay, Escanaba, Riverside which is 12 miles from Chicago we spent some time at. We took a Cottage and stayed there while our house was being finished. Many young Gentlemen came out on account of my daughters being there, they had picnics, rowing, fishing and balls, so it was very attractive. We had that summer many delightful families.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":74364,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/74364","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/60a4962f6cf1ffb19fb1ee9ef5ce0c55.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/60a4962f6cf1ffb19fb1ee9ef5ce0c55.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/60a4962f6cf1ffb19fb1ee9ef5ce0c55.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/60a4962f6cf1ffb19fb1ee9ef5ce0c55.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-11T19:01:13+00:00","modified":"2020-04-30T20:27:48+00:00","filename":"60a4962f6cf1ffb19fb1ee9ef5ce0c55.jpg","authentication":"a145593d0e975cd606f9607d27be933b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":58,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03_063_o2.jpg","size":993950,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2203,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041775945259831},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["014600"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["014600"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["014600"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"60a4962f6cf1ffb19fb1ee9ef5ce0c55.jpg","FileDateTime":1531335610,"FileSize":993950,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2203\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2203,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:09 12:47:46","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:04 01:46:00","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:04 01:46:00","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":95,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1837,"ExifImageLength":3001,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803255,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1090,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1090","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Dec 25 1873.

Eva, Hunt and myself. We had a delightful trip, all well and happy. We had a lunch with us that Mr Harvey and Belle fixed up for us. We enjoyed it. We arrived at seven in the morning, found David waiting for us. We got in his Carriage and went to his house. Found my mother, father, and sister Belle and children waiting for us, all delighted to have us with them. We went right in to breakfast, and I had a chat with my Mothers Parrot. My Mother and Father look well, but quite feeble. Sister Belle looks well. Her children much grown. We stayed about ten days or nearly two weeks, received many calls from our old friends, Eva quite a Belle, she had many gentlemen to come and see her and we went to the Opera often. Attended a German at Miss Dulancys, also one at the Gault House. Received much attention. Had a call from my old minister Dr Cruik. My sisters house is so very large that it is almost impossible to warm it, so Hunt took croup and Pneumonia and for a week was very sick. Dr Keeler attended him. As soon as he was better we left our old home and took cars for home, 2 Hunt had a Cage his Aunt gave him with two white mice to bring home with him. He was a favorite with all in the Cars. We were in Louisville about three weeks. The night before we left Mattie Faulds gave a large young ladies party for Eva and invited several married ladies for me. We enjoyed it very much. Eva was a great belle. We arrived X home on Ash Wednesday. I went to church at 10 o'clock that morning. We attended church almost every day during Lent. Weather cold and part of the time snowing. Mrs Locke ill. X  Octave gone to Louisville to spend two weeks with Mattie, she has a bad cold. Florence Dulaney has Typhoid fever, but she is now recovering.  After Lent on Easter Sunday every one expected to appear fresh and bright in new clothes, but the day was very cold and a heavy snow storm.

This month is cold with a few mild days. All of us well. Mrs Leiter returned home from Louisville, her Nannie has been sick in Louisville at the Gault's house. My Sisters paid Mrs Leiter much attention, both of them placed their Carriages at her command.  X  Friday March 27. 1874.  X  For two days Belle now Mrs Harvey, has been complaining and tonight at seven O.clock she had born a lovely little girl with black hair and perfect form. It is a nice baby, weights nine pound. Belle doing splendidly. I have been with her for several days and will stay all night. She had Dr Byford as her doctor, Dr Small was out. Mr Harvey is wild with delight at it being a daughter, he published it all over the country in the papers. I think it will be called Belle, after her mother. The Harvey boys are delighted with their Sister. On Easter day the baby received flowers from many friends and jewels from her father, Mr Angell, Ada, Eva, and myself. I gave her a white merino cloak, Eva a lace cap, Ada a ring and bracelet. Her Father gave her rings and Mr Angel gave her a beautiful chain and locket and she had other gifts. That night Belle was quite sick from excitement and did not get up Monday as she expected, but on Wednesday she got up for first time for 13 days. She feels well and strong, her breasts a little sore and tender from her chill and fever, but now she is better. Every day she feels stronger and better, it is hard now for me to keep her back. On Monday, which is two weeks and two days, she rode up to our house, her first ride, I scolded her for going out so soon, but her nurse Mrs Nelson said it would not hurt her, but do her good. So I said no more. Weather cold and windy. Belle is now getting so well that she rides out and receives calls, goes out shopping, and talks of going to Louisville. She received a box of beautiful gold and silver gifts from all her relations in Grandma Sheridan's family. Mrs Harvey is a great favorite with many.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":74368,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/74368","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/205816efd08517eb896b43fb96623ea6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/205816efd08517eb896b43fb96623ea6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/205816efd08517eb896b43fb96623ea6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/205816efd08517eb896b43fb96623ea6.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-11T19:01:18+00:00","modified":"2020-05-01T12:21:17+00:00","filename":"205816efd08517eb896b43fb96623ea6.jpg","authentication":"5c5e64a9d4745bbd08caa9bf1bea1a15","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":62,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03_067_o2.jpg","size":1182774,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2214,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049465271504567},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["015022"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["015022"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["015022"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"205816efd08517eb896b43fb96623ea6.jpg","FileDateTime":1531335610,"FileSize":1182774,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2214\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2214,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:09 12:47:53","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:04 01:50:22","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:04 01:50:22","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":37,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1846,"ExifImageLength":3001,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803255,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1090,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1090","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Tuesday, April 22, 1874.

X  Wedding Day -- Today has arrived, all well, bright and sunny. We have our house in fine order, our flowers arrived at one and James Faulds my nephew arranged them beautifully. Gifts have been coming in all day, and Eva is wild with delight. We sent to the Convent for Mattie Sheridan to come in. At four O,clock we were all dressed and to our regret a sudden thunder shower came up, but it only lasted a moment and was all over. We had a carpet spread on our front steps, and the whole house dressed in flowers. At five all the bridesmaids and groomsmen arrived six in number, and at half past five we all got in our Carriages, two and two. Little Hunt went with me, dressed in white suit with blue boots, blue sash and blue ribbon tied on his hair, blue silk gloves. The bridesmaids were all dressed in Swiss with different coloured flowers and fans made of flowers, they were very pretty. The bride had a lovely bouquet, so did I. The street to the church was lined with carriages, the street also filled with people. An awning was up at the church door, and the church was filled with people, all our friends  came. The ceremony was very impressive, and all were so well drilled that no mistake was made and everything went off splendidly. We returned to our house and had a band of Music, and a few invited friends. Gen Sheridan was present and in a few moments we had Supper announced. Our table was beautiful in flowers and our supper fine. All marched into supper. Eva was well served and very soon left the room to be dressed for her Journey. Her traveling suit was brown silk and cloth, she looked very handsome. Sheridan prepared her a lunch and the happy pair went off with their servant Joe Miller as attendant. Our friends remained until ten, and some danced. My new girl Agustis came this afternoon (a coloured girl).  X  Eva looked so beautiful and seemed so happy. She is truly one gifted as well as lovely. She has no faults, it is rare to meet one like her, she is such a sunbeam and yet so much power and strength, few are like her.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":74381,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/74381","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8e15bd0bc6cc91dcb42396c49b46dd36.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8e15bd0bc6cc91dcb42396c49b46dd36.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8e15bd0bc6cc91dcb42396c49b46dd36.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8e15bd0bc6cc91dcb42396c49b46dd36.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-11T19:01:32+00:00","modified":"2020-05-01T17:58:25+00:00","filename":"8e15bd0bc6cc91dcb42396c49b46dd36.jpg","authentication":"7e4090fb01c0c38d1910fc3ebdd941c7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":75,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03_082_o2.jpg","size":918869,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2211,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.038480535035261},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["135546"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["135546"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["135546"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8e15bd0bc6cc91dcb42396c49b46dd36.jpg","FileDateTime":1531335611,"FileSize":918869,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2211\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2211,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:09 12:48:21","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:04 13:55:46","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:04 13:55:46","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":44,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1917,"ExifImageLength":3121,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803254,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1090,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1090","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Friday June 5th 1874.

We think Mattie Belle Shreve lost her handsome locket there as she missed it soon after. A Mosquito bit me on the eye and swelled it up for two days. So much for our frolic. When we reached Niagara we all went out on the platform to see the Falls. They look so cool and sweet. The scenery all along the route is very pretty. We are going the Erie route, and the hills and vales, also mountains make the scenery good. The streams of water intersperse all along. At six O.clock we reached Hornesville, I there posted two letters one to Chicago and one to Louisville. The day is beautiful, Hunt enjoyed his trip very much. We took our dinner and supper in the car and our basket of lunch was much sought after.  Teusday, July 14. 1874.  This morning I rose at half past three. Dressed myself. I was the first person up.

This seaside place is situated on a high elevation of ground it commands a good view of the bay and one or two towns are in view, it is cool and delightful, yet still warm. The Hotel is only one year old, it is kept by Mr Lufkins, his wife and Granddaugther are the principal ones who take charge. Everything is new and nice, we have eight nice rooms all together.

Last night it poured rain and this morning the ocean was wild with rage.  The New York party went away from our hotel about six and it woke me.  After breakfast we all went down to the Beach. It looked much changed.  The storm had thrown up a quantity of sand and the Beach was smooth and lovely to walk on.  but the surf was high so was the wind we could not stay very long.  We spent part of our day in the house writing. the rest on the porch. after dinner this afternoon we walked again to the Beach and another change had taken place. The sand was washed away after the tide went out and the rocks were exposed and sea weed and jelly fish was thrown up in abundance.  One large skate fish was on the sand and many star fish. We had many letters from home.  one from Lake Forest from Belle and one from Ada who is at Lake Forest. One from Chicago from Mr. Badger. all of us well. and much sun burnt.  Teusday Aug 4th 1874. \nToday has been another perfect day, all of us well , we walked to the Beach early today to see the high surf, it is not cold like yesterday.  all our young people except Adele & Hunt all went to the observatory to see over the country and took a sail on the Lake and picked fern leaves.

I received a letter from Mr Badger today, he has been to Lake Forest for a few days to see Belle and Ada. Octavius has been to a watering place at Fruitport. Mattie Sheridan has gone to New York she started the first of August, she has been with us for six years, going to boarding school and staying with us on her vacations. She now returns to her Mother to remain with her as long as she can keep her. Today is beautiful, part of our party gone to Denniss, David has hired a Phaeton for Virginia to ride in.

After dinner we went into the parlous and danced and had a good time.\nSaturday Aug 8th 1874\nWhen I arose this morning I found it raining very steadily. Took breakfast and assisted Mattie make a new Alpaca dress. After dinner dressed again it still continues to rain. I received a letter from Lake Forest from my daughter, she reports everything beautiful and all well. After tea we went into the parlous and had Dancing until ten or eleven. It still rains, we all well and happy.\nSunday Aug 9th 1874\nIt rained all night and is raining now at ten o'clock, so I suppose we will have to stay in doors, which is very hard when there is so much to attract one out. I think Dr Hulse will lecture this afternoon, all of us well. I will write home today. It is now three o'clock and the rain has ceased. Several gentlemen came from Denniss and so did five or six ladies to hear Dr Hulse, his lecture was fine.

Much to my deep regret I received the news of the death of Bishop Whitehouse of Chicago Illinois, he was a great man and a good Christian. His loss will be deeply felt, far and near. News from home say that Octavius has hurt his spine from too much rowing while at Fruitport. Tonight the wind has changed and a light fog has come up and it rains, it has taken off all the Mosquitoes. Today we had quite an  X  excitement, some men came and walked into our Landlady,s room and took all her Gin Whiskey and wines, it being against the law to sell liquor and he had done it at his own Bar. Tonight David went down with Mr Lufkin to try and fix it, but it being against the law, I think he will have to pay one hundred dollars. This afternoon Dr Hulse lectured to some people who called on Mr Lufkin. It rains so no one can play croquet, we went in the parlour and danced. At noon Mrs Westcott left for Boston. Mrs R.J.

Some are cutting their wagons into making carts one half going back and the other going on.  we are meeting 200 teams a day and some who claim to have been through have some specimens of brass gold dust that mines were salted with.  Hail storm last night.  our oxen travel like horses and the Road is smooth and fine Camped on Platte Bottoms\ntraveled 25 miles","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":92226,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/92226","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/a068b1db30a008b600d5ffcd71fad108.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/a068b1db30a008b600d5ffcd71fad108.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/a068b1db30a008b600d5ffcd71fad108.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a068b1db30a008b600d5ffcd71fad108.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-09T21:12:46+00:00","modified":"2020-06-20T17:18:35+00:00","filename":"a068b1db30a008b600d5ffcd71fad108.jpg","authentication":"a4862d135f5ca65cbba3de73e215961f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":44,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_981_00026_o2.jpg","size":955729,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1834,"resolution_y":2955,"compression_ratio":0.058783669497817}},"item":{"id":1199,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1199","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"42 \nJournal Across the plains in 1859\nTuesday May 10th\nthe Mominee outfit have only 1 yoke of oxen and the Boys Bilderback and Robinson are discouraged about Pikes Peak and don't want to go to California.  they sat up nearly all last night and talked over the matter This morning they decided to go back, and Bilderback started early on foot to overtake Hungerfords and left Robinson and Mominee to come along with the wagon Mominee wants to go to California but they cant make 2 teams of 1 yoke of oxen.

You had just been hearing one of Mr Wilbers excellent sermons. I did not make out near as well as that that day. I wrote to you about the Sabbaths here.\n\nToday it is far better. It is however a very rainy day; a really great rain indeed; but there were a dozen or more men out to hear Mr Post preach ~ no women however.\nHe preached almost without notes from \"The Earth is full of the goodness of God\". He quoted Lieut. Maury's \"Physical Geography of the Sea\" in relation to the influence of the Gulf Streams; also quoted Hugh Miller, & Barry's theory of the differences of nations on sides of East & West mountain ranges, & their homogeniety on sides of North & South ranges. Perhaps he started this theory rather more plainly than I have though. He made it all plain & applied it to the limited States, that God has written its history in the North & South mountains & rivers, as the greatest & richest & undivided of Nations.\nEnlarging upon the prospects & duties of the people of this country; he finally came down to DuQuoin, its prospects, its people, and their duties.\nHe said it was probable that this would be the most important place in Southern Illinois ~probable ~almost certain ~ necessary\u00a0; and it behoved the good people now here, for the sake of themselves, their children, & their children's children, to put forth their energies now and start the right influences & institutions here now.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102658,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102658","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ba87cd1b2a1c3d9a2161e9f63b19ea5d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ba87cd1b2a1c3d9a2161e9f63b19ea5d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ba87cd1b2a1c3d9a2161e9f63b19ea5d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ba87cd1b2a1c3d9a2161e9f63b19ea5d.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T00:24:13+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:31+00:00","filename":"ba87cd1b2a1c3d9a2161e9f63b19ea5d.jpg","authentication":"eb1b9fee20e9756e0c0540994c5d53aa","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_179_009_002_o2.jpg","size":1510987,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2286,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.061201313956126},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["234028"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["234028"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["234028"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ba87cd1b2a1c3d9a2161e9f63b19ea5d.jpg","FileDateTime":1595809444,"FileSize":1510987,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2286\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2286,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:40:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:40:28","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:40:28","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3139,"ExifImageLength":4943,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1281,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1281","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"now, before the thousands of Miners, degraded ~ ignorant~sensual should outnumber out vote out influence there and this village.

Well, he uses this kind of paper, and doubles the lines throughout; two lines to every one of these, and four full pages at that usually. The letters he replies to are just about the same sort. He has the ladies Miniature, but will not show it to me. Whereat I laugh at him, and tell him it is boyish.   I did not get any letter last night as I hoped to do. However I will not much complain. I have fared pretty well the past week; had at least three during the week, and the last one received Friday night, written last Monday, was seven excellent pages from yourself, and three from Sister Jennie.

He & the Big Gun of the Campbellites - if however they do not turn him off for getting found out in his horse & watch jockeying - He preaches rather better than when I heard him before, but - Oh dear - it was only words, words, words. I am heartily tired of such preaching. This afternoon is a Methodist Class Meeting, but I did not conclude to attend it. This evening Peter Hagler is to preach, and I shall attend I think; if it is muddy & dark. I do very much wish that Mr Post could preach here all the time and live here - stay here all the time himself. I know his influence would be worth so much to the place. It would affect its whole future. I have offered to give one hundred dollars per year towards his salary, if he could be here all the time ~ One hundred dollars a year till the people here are able to support him which would not be long I think. I think it would be done if the Carbondale interest did not keep him there.

Every letter from home is a treat; and the longer I am away from home , not only the more I want to go home, but the more I both long for and enjoy the letters from home.  It seems my letters are nearly twice as long lately in getting from here to Elyria, as yours in coming from there here. I am glad you have warm weather there. Here it has been very warm for nearly two weeks. This morning there was the least tinge of hoar frost upon boards none showed upon the ground. And it was the coldest morning I think since Feb 11th.

I walked two miles down to \"the hollow\", where the DuBuque and Pacific R.R. leaves the river, and where its temporary buildings are, before the expensive Depot grounds in the slough can be finished. The iron Train \"Reconstruction, was to go out about Seven oclock; but the Engine got off the Rails on the hard curve of the Iron track, and they did not get started till Eleven.  But I improved the time by climbing the Bluff to \"DuBuque's Grave\" the grave of old Julien DuBuque of whom I wrote you a few days since. I certainly could not but admire the old fellow's taste if his selection of a burial place. It is a high narrow Bluff, perpendicular or overhanging at the end, projecting into the river between Cat fish Creek & 'the Hollow', which Hollow was the great smelting place for the Lead ore mined in the Bluff cities around. This DuBuque's Bluff overlooks completely DuBuque & Dunleith, some three miles up the river and the whole mighty Mississippi flowing between its magnificent bluff banks a mile or two apart, for many miles North & South.   The Tomb was a sort of Artificial Case, excavated on the point of the bluff, and built up of rough masonry which still remains. It had a great cover\non side:  Col. M did not arrive.

I was tempted though to sit all day upon that sunny bluff, among those few old trees, to gaze upon the ancient river while hurrying on its olden course, and the newborn cities springing up along its sides.  But I crept and slid down the old bluff's steep snowy Northern side, and climbed upon the Locomotive \"Sioux City\", which with its load of Iron crawled slowly and windingly out among the Bluffs and up the crooked little valley of the Catfish Creek, until I finally emerged into or upon the high broad Prairies of Iowa. In twenty Miles the Rail Road rises 550 feet or more. The Track is very rough, laid on a half finingled Road bed, on frost & ice & snow, in a very cold Winter.

Cars, & no stop over 15 miles. till we reached here at 2 oclock this P.M. Hattie in pretty good spirits throughout; but did not sleep much. Anna M. did heartily, though a good deal sick when awake.

I called at Dr. Dascombs'. They are all well, and said they wanted to see you. The Doctor went over to the Cars with me, and introduced me to a young Mr. Cowles, a son of Prof. Cowles of Oberlin, a Theological Student, a tall fine looking young fellow, going out to Bellevue where he is preaching this winter. He was very good company. On the cars also was Rev. Jos. Eells of Cleveland, going out to Fremont to preach this evening - unusual religious interest there at present. Had considerable conversation with him about Elyria etc.\nThe Toledo Wabash & Western Train does not leave here until about 1 oclock, so I have quite a waiting before me.\n\nI guess Rolling will take care of things pretty well if not reprove him. I have instructed him about the Furnace etc. If there should come extreme cold weather so as to require unusual fires, you might look down cellar occasionally and about the pipes etc. to see that all is right. If any thing goes wrong any where in any thing that Rollin can not fix satisfactorily call upon Mr. Waldo or the Doctor, or","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102702,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102702","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f59e1239b8eda9047065f8b3c5be1dd4.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f59e1239b8eda9047065f8b3c5be1dd4.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f59e1239b8eda9047065f8b3c5be1dd4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f59e1239b8eda9047065f8b3c5be1dd4.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T00:25:14+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:31+00:00","filename":"f59e1239b8eda9047065f8b3c5be1dd4.jpg","authentication":"b4e78d12bb683383796e803bc9cfcbe2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_181_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1596533,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2923,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050573769972504},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["030535"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["030535"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["030535"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f59e1239b8eda9047065f8b3c5be1dd4.jpg","FileDateTime":1595809446,"FileSize":1596533,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2923\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2923,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:25:12","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:01 03:05:35","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:01 03:05:35","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3032,"ExifImageLength":3733,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1281,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1281","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"or Mr. Crane about the furnace.\nThe $5.00 I left on the bureau for Mr. Darling I gave to him myself.\nIf you want Crushed Sugar send Rollin to get a bucket full - He need say nothing about to 100 lbs.

Keyes made out the bill about half price, and receipting it gave to Skinner to deliver & bring back the money. But in return of the Messenger Mr. Keyes was astonished, amazed & vexed at receipt of a polite note of thanks for the liberal donation of furniture! He pocketed it as best he might and said nothing. Not long since he received a note from Mrs. Weeks inquiring whether he did not intend that donation of furniture to herself rather than to the Seminary!  He coolly answered that he certainly did not intend it as a donation to the Seminary, and so Mrs. Weeks carried it off!\nThis forenoon, to Church. Mr. Hawkins the Methodist preached, Methodists occupy the Church half the time.

Wilder and myself came down here, by eight o clock. Wilder sleeping most of the way. Wilder is a very good boy, very little trouble in any way - was some, at least needed watching some at Bangor with Irving; but here or at Brownville none at all hardly, except that he must talk rather too much. His health is first rate, like mine, eats any thing, and every thing, and a great deal of it; Nothing hurts him in any way, and he grows fat. The change of climate suits him.

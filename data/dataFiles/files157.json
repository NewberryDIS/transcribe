Dec. 1. 1858 _\n\nDear Father & Mother & All,\n\n  It seems a good while since we have heard from you, though it is not really so very long either. But we feel anxious to know how you all are, mother's knee, Anna's finger, Sarah, Mary, and all. I often with there was some more speedy way of hearing, especially when some of you are not very well. We are sorry it seems best for Cynthia not to study this term. She studied too hard last term, had three studies. Algebra very hard. But she seems enjoying herself and her health improving rapidly. Probably by taking care and rest this term, she will then be able to go on without injuring her. I think it will be much better for her to regard her health before her studies if it does take her longer, than to get through with impaired health. She is not very strong, but gets on nicely when she does not under take too much.\n  The rest of us are usually well. It is very cold today and windy - quite suitable for December. Lissie was much pleased with grandma's letter I want her to answer it before long. They go to school now _ have been about two weeks, and like it very much. It agrees with Johnnie so far better than we expected.

We had Jennie's good letter yesterday and were so glad to hear that Sarah and Wm. had accomplished their journey so well, without detention or accident and with such pleasant weather. We have had delightful spring weather all the week. very little snow left. Sleighing all gone. I go out on the piazza every day and I think it does me good. We had a good letter from Br. and sister Butler today.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":36378,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/36378","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/602576dda2c52b3d7ebefa94402b21d5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/602576dda2c52b3d7ebefa94402b21d5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/602576dda2c52b3d7ebefa94402b21d5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/602576dda2c52b3d7ebefa94402b21d5.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-12T13:52:28+00:00","modified":"2020-12-02T14:41:22+00:00","filename":"602576dda2c52b3d7ebefa94402b21d5.jpg","authentication":"748d57e5c2a09dabe949fd1629dc6921","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_03_fl_132_027_02_o2.jpg","size":995651,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2312,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.039874527425349},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160304"],"TimeCreated":["060236"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160304"],"TimeCreated":["060236"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160304"],"TimeCreated":["060236"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"602576dda2c52b3d7ebefa94402b21d5.jpg","FileDateTime":1507816126,"FileSize":995651,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2312\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2312,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"9mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:03:07 14:16:27","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:04 06:02:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:04 06:02:36","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":32,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1599,"ExifImageLength":2489,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":157,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/157","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"They are both well as usual and think they shall visit us next summer.

We feel deeply in regard to the state of Robert's health. Might he not be home -- fitted by going to Saratoga Springs? We very much desire to hear that he is improving. We hope also to hear that Mary is better. \n   We were glad to receive a letter from John. He speaks of the country as a very fine one, and seems to be quite encouraged. Had I had the time I should like to make a journey through the West, and especially to Kansas. It is too much to believe that that beautiful country is to be given up to slavery: yet what else can we expect, if Buchanan is elected President? There is great interest felt here with the presidential question.

Hope you will have health and success, and be able to do and get good in your new position. Your terms are very long. How will such a long stretch without vacation agree with you. In laying out your plans you must make calculations for this and not get used up too soon. One cannot do as much for a period long extended, as they can for a short time and then rest. How many recitations do you hear daily?\nAs to that matter with Prof. H. as you are a newcomer and a stranger, would it not be best, if he is willing to relieve you of any responsibility, to allow him to do so. Any controversy or\nin margins\nany position they may give you, and do the very best you can. and if there is any complaint let it come from some other quarter. There may be some things unpleasant about it, but I would hear them, and pray for more grace. It would accomplish more for you in the end. Do not be particular about your position or the classes you hear, you are a stranger there and sort of alone and if you do the very best you can in your circumstances they will not see you wronged.

Had not been over there before since last Spring, on account of going to Biddeford and the children's sickness.\nWe are writing to John today.\n\nthe children had a very pretty letter from Miss Crawford the other day.

It was pleasant weather all through.\n\n   They were not expecting us till to night, so were taken a little by surprise. They were very glad to see us, as we to see them. The children look better than when\n\n\nSarah, you must not work too hard. You are so well now I fear you will think you can do too much. How I wish you were all nearer.

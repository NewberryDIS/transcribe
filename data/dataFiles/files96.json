Holyoke Seminary, Feb. 27 '49 \n\nDear sister Elizabeth:\n\n  I am sitting in my little room all alone, this bright lovely morning. The full orbed moon moving in solitude, accompanied by but one gentle star, is sending her pure beams through the window. The snow is almost entirely gone and nature seems to be striving to put on her green robe once more. Our morning walks now are delightful, the cold storms have passed, and we no longer fear, if we slacken our pace a little, freezing shall be the penalty. I wish you could partake of these pleasures with me. But, oh! vain wish be silent. Last week two of my friends, that I have found since coming here, were invited by their sister. She is teaching in a young ladies seminary and came to pass her vacation with her sisters. They were indeed happy in her society from wednesday until monday morn, I tried not to envy them. I became a little acquainted with her, it was very pleasant to see some one once more from the busy world, and learn a little of the news of the day. I should love to have you come and see the school, it would be quite a curiosity to see how every thing is managed in this great family. There are quite a number sick now, one is  considered quite dangerous, her mother came here night before last. Almost all of us are more or less troubled with colds. Harriet and Alice have both quite a hard cold, I am quite well except a little cold like the rest. I have had to leave this to go to breakfast and the room-work, extra-work, and domestic-work have so occupied my time that I have not touched this more until now (late in","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":24213,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/24213","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/6a18ccdcf29dc86d578ad0e177b5d6d3.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/6a18ccdcf29dc86d578ad0e177b5d6d3.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/6a18ccdcf29dc86d578ad0e177b5d6d3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6a18ccdcf29dc86d578ad0e177b5d6d3.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-05T13:54:57+00:00","modified":"2020-01-16T22:14:54+00:00","filename":"6a18ccdcf29dc86d578ad0e177b5d6d3.jpg","authentication":"c493ca1bef6f0b17491fb71f5faf9c1b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_04_fl_147_001_02_o2.jpg","size":1286646,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2780,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042853916866507},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["002422"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["002422"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["002422"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["002422"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["002422"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["002422"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6a18ccdcf29dc86d578ad0e177b5d6d3.jpg","FileDateTime":1507211687,"FileSize":1286646,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2780\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2780,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:06 14:05:48","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 00:24:22","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 00:24:22","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":96,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/96","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"the afternoon). I had a very pleasant this morning, I went alone, my room-mates did not feel like going, I took father's and mother's and Eddy;s likeness (which I suppose you know they sent me in a letter) for company it seemed almost as though they were with me. I walked on lots and through the grass yard. In any walk I came to a grove with sparkling rill passing through it, this was a lovely place, on each side were steep hills which concealed the village and busy world from views here I walked some time happy with the likness, rill, and trees. Oh! I think sometimes how little did I know how to value my friends, which I was with them. This world I find is peopled by a cold and I often think deceitful race, I must thank (Harriet for all the pleasure I find in these parts, she is a dear good girl and knows how to be a sister to the lonely. You asked in your last whether she is that sister who visited Niagra Falls with her brother, George, she is not, that was Sophia, who is now dead. He  attended school last year at Lansingburg, where that young lady went, who, you remember, came to Whitestown to school a year ago last fall and left after being there only two days because she was so home sick. I feel rather discouraged in regard to my progress, it seems as though I had learned very little since I came here, what a pleasure it would be could I only talk it all over with you, pen and ink I find is too formal for such things. I cannot find any fault with the school, but time is what is wanting. Miss Whitman is I think a person of a very strong mind, and I think the main support of this school. I love my new section teacher more and more every day. She is quite young I should judge, and very sweet in her appearance. She graduated here last year, and was regarded as a very good student.

You can hardly know how much I want to see dear little Henry, I very often think of him and his pretty hair, I wonder whether I should know him from that if I were to see him in a stranger's arms. Many and many a sweet image have I formed of him in my mind which I have no doubt he resembles, give him a warm kiss for me, now dont forget. I am glad to hear he gives no little trouble, I think I have no great reason to fear you will spoil him by rocking. Give my best love to Mr. and Mrs. Butler and tell them I often wish myself in their quiet kitchen enjoying a pleasant chat with them I have tried to obey Mrs. Butlers advice about being good, but I find it is not so easily done as I used to think for.

Nov. 9, 1861\n\nDear Annie,\n\n  Last evening after Cynthia and I had sent a joint letter to the office for you, we received the last one you wrote. I think it was a fine idea of yours thus to pay up your letter debts all with one letter, tho' of course I think my own way a little better. I dont very often stop to think whether I owe you a letter or not; if I feel like writing or if I've any news, I get my folio and commence a letter. Now, tonight, it seems to me that perhaps a letter may do you a little good, your last does not sound as tho' it was written in the best of spirits. I am very sorry.\n\nin margin\nin and spoke to me but I never looked for his wife or asked him about her thinking she was talking with her uncles.

South Hadley is a very healthy place. There has been no sickness prevalent here and but a few deaths since I came here. Our large family of about 270 persons have none of them been particularly sick since this term commenced; it is true that almost all the time there are some that are a little unwell and it is not to be wondered at among so many.

Our fire was not in a good condition to cover so we put down the fender and hurried to bed, we had hardly laid our heads down when the tardy bell struck; soon the fire commenced to blaze and Hatty rose to cover it, while she was doing this who should come in but Miss Peabody, one of the teachers, we were frightened as you may well know but the affair being explained we soon recovered our usual frame of mind.

I get along pretty well with my studies. New week we shall commence a new series. I will write when I have arranged my new studies and send you a schedule of my time. Miss Hagen our assistant preceptress is to he married to Rev. Mr. Stoddard a missionary among the Nestorians. He lost his first wife on the mission field. He is now in this country. I heard him preach a few week since, he is a very smart man and appears very devoted. Miss Hagen has for a long time felt that she ought to be a missionary, but the way has not been opened for her until now.

Do not fail to write to me now. I must reserve the rest of the sheet for Mary and I fear she will think that I have left her but little room. I would write another sheet if I had the time but this suffice now. Love to Brother and Mr. Mrs. Butler and ask them sometimes to think I will write to Robert some. I am sorry to find that he is so much dis- (of Jane.) appointed in John Williams (I fear you cannot read this) \n\n South Hadley. Wed. aff. \n\nDear Mary: I have read your letter again and again since I receved it. I did feel as thought I had quite a visit with you and Robert. His letter was a sheet of foolscap written on all four sides. He seems to be in low spirits, you must try to cheer him. You do not know how much pleasure it will give you if ever you are so far away as I am to think that you have actted the part of a true sister. Oh! that I had been more kind when I was with my dear brothers and sisters. Can they ever forget my many unkind words. Give my love to cousin E. and tell her to write to me. I will write to her the first spare moment I have, if she knew how little time I have I know she would not be surprised that I have not written. Tell her that she must not do as she has threattened, for she said if I did not write her she would no longer own me for a cousin. Our school closes next week, friday, we shall have two weeks vacation. I wish I was near enough to visit you then. Alice is going to spend it with her cousin's family who live about 20 miles from here. Harriet will stay here so I shall not be left alone. Harriet and Alice send their love to you, they are very pleasant girls. Alice thinks you have become quite an adept in baby-tending by this time She and Miss Allen (one of the ladies) are sitting near me by the stove studying their algebra and Miss A. joins in love to you. You say you wish you could have some of my paper flowers, I wish so too. Alice expects one of her brothers here next spring if he comes I will send you since he goes to Utica very often and could leave them there. You see by E. letter that our next series begins two days before school closes. Our minister, Mr. Seauril? had a donation party last night, most of the teachers went. They said they had a very pleasant time he had quite a large company. Next Sabbath is is communion season and the preparatory lecture is to be friday afternoon, we are all expected to attend this just as much as meetings on the sabbath. There has been but one since I came here. It was very interesting, the subject was the first preparatory lecture delivered by christ before the last supper. It is a very pleasant day much warmer than it has been for some time. I have not walked but once this week, that was Monday it stormed some and Miss Whitman excused us half the distance. I wash tuesdays now I had such a large wash this week that I rubed the skin off my finger, I iron Saturday morning before breakfast, I go down quarter before six and have from then till 71\/2 to iron in, I have to hurry some when I have a large wash. It is now near dark and I have not got my lessons for to morrow. Sarah Robert says is about the same, poor girl. I begin to feel quite discouraged about her, does the Dr. still think he can cure her, in her last letter to me she wrote that she hoped to meet me at the gate when I go home. Oh! that it might be so dear girl how often do I think of her cheerfulness during her long sickness. How does mother get along, has she any one to help her, you can never know until you are seperated from her how precious it is to assist her, tell me all you can about home for none of them think to write to me except G. and he cannot often. I am glad to hear that Elder C. is getting better. Give my love to his daughters and to all my friends. Don't fail to write soon.

May 15, '58\nDear Sister: \nShall I write you a stormy letter? The sole topic of conversation and almost of thought is the storm of last Thursday. It commenced at about 2 1\/2 P.M. by a most fearful hailstorm accompanied by thunder and lightning. The hailstones were from one to two inches in diameter. It was terrible to hear the crash of our windows. We have no shutters and during less than ten minutes about 150 lights, many 25' by 18', were broken. The calm after the storm was unusually peaceful. The sun looked smiling down upon the bright face of nature and seemed to whisper peace. This continued for about two hours when the lightning began to dart fearfully along the sky. Those who are accustomed to western storms say that the clouds had gathered along the western horizon, portending wind, but we saw it not. We first noticed particularly the violent bending of the tress when suddenly the rain was driven in sheets across the square in front of the Sem. so dense that we could see nothing else. The noise was so great that we distinguished \nleft half of page\ning when quietness was again restored. - The morning brought consciousness of the danger through which we had passed and our hearts were filled with gratitude to our heavenly Father. Other places about have suffered still more than this. Peoria, a city a little east of us, is said to lie half in ruins, but I forbare to give rumors. The tornado was, I believe, not felt in Chicago, and we hope not on the lakes. I wrote home yesterday. It is more than a week since we have heard from them. They miss you for writing letters. Eddie has ceased to correspond with us. Does he ever write to you? How is Mary? Does the visit seem to improve her health? She ought not to try to do anything but get well. Do you like the East as well as at first and do you find your studies easier as you become accustomed to them. When is your vacation? How long do you expect to remain with Elizabeth? I do not quite understand whether you have entered the course or not. We are both well and unite in you all. Your sister Jennie.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":24344,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/24344","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c046315d802045fc9d5b2e86b5f7e22c.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c046315d802045fc9d5b2e86b5f7e22c.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c046315d802045fc9d5b2e86b5f7e22c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c046315d802045fc9d5b2e86b5f7e22c.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-05T14:00:26+00:00","modified":"2020-12-31T16:14:50+00:00","filename":"c046315d802045fc9d5b2e86b5f7e22c.jpg","authentication":"8bdd1ab208bc97b2bd4cd7b5f8f7c090","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_04_fl_150_003_02_o2.jpg","size":1104840,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2271,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.045046235138705},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["004049"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["004049"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["004049"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c046315d802045fc9d5b2e86b5f7e22c.jpg","FileDateTime":1507211692,"FileSize":1104840,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2271\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2271,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:05 11:35:50","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 00:40:49","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 00:40:49","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":88,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2429,"ExifImageLength":3849,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":96,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/96","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"left side of page\nnothing of the falling of a noble church, scarcely two rods distant. This was Dr. Beecher's church, a fine, large brick building about the size of the First Church, Utica, and not yet quite completed. The steple fell and crushed the inside of the house and soon the side walls gave way. All is a mass of ruins, only the end walls stand of what was so lately the largest and only beautiful church in the place. There is great sympathy felt for the society which is new and by no means wealthy. I hear they are considerably in debt for the building. \n\n The storm came from the north=west and carried the timbers of the church towards the Sem, but they did not strike. The corner of our roof was torn away and pieces of the cornice were hurled to the ground. Much of the trim was also torn from the roof. The rain and wind came in at the broken windows, hurling the broken pieces of glass in every direction and we hastened to take refuge in the south=east part of the building. The streets had become great rivers, sweeping away the fences and sidewalks. Almost every home \n\nright side of page\nin the place was more or less injured, but the brick buildings suffered the most. One large new building, into a part of which the family had lately moved, was thrown down and the only part standing is the room in which the family were. God mercifully preserved them unhurt. Another house in which the carpenters were at work, fell: one man only was hurt, he had his arm broken. Several houses near the creek were partly fill with water.- one, not occupied at present- was carried down the stream several rods. This storm continued about three quarters of an hour and all was quiet and pleasant except for the sad marks of destruction, till after ten. We had moved our beds all on to the south side and made ourselves comfortable for the night, when the storm again broke out, but with much less violence.

Mother and the girls like the dishes very much, especially the creamer and the sugar bowl if it was only whole. If you could would like to have you get me a net- something like Jennie's, only a little larger. Hers is rather small. If you have not got the moss already, would you not look at the little baskets, and see if you could get something pretty for the center of my wreath. Jennie thinks she saw some, where they keep the moss. Do not trouble about those little things, if it is not convenient to get them. If you see any thing else at Myers that would be pretty in the wreath, some pretty green leaves or something so. Please procure if not too costly. Those leaves you sent are very pretty. Don't go any where but Myers for these things, unless you wish to. I don't want you to run all over the city, and tire yourself all out before you come home. Sarah would like to have you get some cards for her- suitable for large scholars- also look at question books and get your own pleasure about getting some. She thinks there are cards with little maps on them if you find any such please get some for her. I think I saw some pretty embossed cards, ten or so in a pack, at Davies, different from any she has ever had, but I do not remember much about them- look at them and if you think best get them.

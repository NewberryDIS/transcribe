He graduated from Wrexham Seminary in 1815, and soon after was ordained a minister with the Congregationalists at Capel L\u00f4n Swan, Denbigh. During this time Everett learned a system of shorthand writing, which he adapted to the Welsh language and continued to use throughout his life. While at Denbigh he wrote an instructional book of this shorthand writing, as well as a Sunday school catechism first published in 1822. He married Elizabeth Roberts, of Denbigh, in 1816, and the couple emigrated to America in 1823 when Everett accepted a call to the Welsh Congregational Church of Utica, NY. He remained in Utica nine years, then moved south to Winfield to become pastor of the Congregational Church there, and also spent a short time as pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Westernville. In 1838 he settled in Steuben, near Remsen, NY, where he took charge of the two Welsh chapels there, Capel Ucha and Penymynydd. Everett continued as pastor in Steuben until his death in 1875. Included here are sermons delivered between 1800 and 1860. Note that the early sermons were most likely not written by Everett, but probably revised and delivered by him. <a href=\"https:\/\/mms.newberry.org\/xml\/xml_files\/Everett.xml#sum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<\/a>","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":41,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/41","name":"Description","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Robert Everett sermons and writings [part 2], 1794-1860s","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":50,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/50","name":"Title","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"98.5","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":38,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/38","name":"Coverage","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"100","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":55,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/55","name":"Percent Completed","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"100100","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":56,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/56","name":"Weight","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}

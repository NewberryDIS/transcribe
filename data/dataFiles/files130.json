It was a beautiful week, sunshine yet not too hot. The breezes made it just nice for work and help dry the hay fast -- Sam did good work each day which gave him an appetite & strength and brought refreshing sleep which he had been a stranger to for a long time. He came home all worn out, nervous, couldnt eat or sleep as a man ought. He took electricity of Mrs. Shepherd in Utica for two weeks. Then before coming up here he bought a battery so I could give it him, which I did every other night the first two weeks. Now he is so much better and sleeps so well he only gets it occasionally -- you will be surprised to know that Anna did her part in the hay field -- riding in the load, I driving as they loaded up. The men moving us about from side to side till they had a big load upon which we rode to the barn then we girls would sit in the mow inhaling its fragrance and watching the men do their work. I too learned to use the horse rake very successfully. It was my first experience in haying but I trust it is not to be my last -- for I enjoyed it all even the hurry & excitement of four or five meals a day, then there was the chickens to look after.

Then I wrote to Mr & Mrs Edwards (former tenants) who owned the furniture of the lower flat and they arrived last Monday, but the room were in such conditions that they had to stay up stairs","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":31208,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/31208","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5bf1a51f85ce25384674b4f3d682788c.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5bf1a51f85ce25384674b4f3d682788c.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5bf1a51f85ce25384674b4f3d682788c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5bf1a51f85ce25384674b4f3d682788c.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-09T16:59:08+00:00","modified":"2020-04-30T04:58:14+00:00","filename":"5bf1a51f85ce25384674b4f3d682788c.jpg","authentication":"f0c34c65c4b7b0d1d99fb4a28bdf10dd","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_07_fl_229_007_02_o2.jpg","size":965322,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2375,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.037634385964912},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160219"],"TimeCreated":["043356"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160219"],"DigitalCreationTime":["043356"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160219"],"TimeCreated":["043356"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160219"],"DigitalCreationTime":["043356"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160219"],"TimeCreated":["043356"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160219"],"DigitalCreationTime":["043356"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5bf1a51f85ce25384674b4f3d682788c.jpg","FileDateTime":1507568111,"FileSize":965322,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2375\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2375,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:06:21 15:45:34","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:19 04:33:56","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:19 04:33:56","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":94,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":130,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/130","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"until yesterday when they moved down stairs.

It was gladly received as your letters always are. I am sorry you should have been together on my account. I knew we were having an unusually stiff breeze and feared it might do damage somewhere but I was not alarmed. I sent you a paper with a account of damage here. The building that fell they say had a permit for a three story house and they built seven stories. No wonder it fell.

Claire and Eva and I went to the hoop drill Saturday evening and the children did their part very nicely. There was quite a good audience and they made over twenty dollars. They are talking of having it repeated in the Opera House","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":31237,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/31237","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3ce43f1842dcffe65e14c619d64485bd.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3ce43f1842dcffe65e14c619d64485bd.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3ce43f1842dcffe65e14c619d64485bd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3ce43f1842dcffe65e14c619d64485bd.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-09T17:00:21+00:00","modified":"2020-05-07T14:35:18+00:00","filename":"3ce43f1842dcffe65e14c619d64485bd.jpg","authentication":"872ed092be7ded14d8530cd985472f24","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_07_fl_231_001_02_o2.jpg","size":977562,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2264,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.039980123674912},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160219"],"TimeCreated":["043848"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160219"],"DigitalCreationTime":["043848"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160219"],"TimeCreated":["043848"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160219"],"DigitalCreationTime":["043848"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160219"],"TimeCreated":["043848"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160219"],"DigitalCreationTime":["043848"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3ce43f1842dcffe65e14c619d64485bd.jpg","FileDateTime":1507568112,"FileSize":977562,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2264\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2264,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:06:21 15:45:36","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:19 04:38:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:19 04:38:48","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":91,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":130,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/130","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Anna enjoyed it very much and would like to go through it again.

They have two beautiful children and live on this street above here. With much love in which Claire and Anna would join were they here.

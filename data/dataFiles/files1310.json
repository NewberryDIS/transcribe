Although I am, in reading the works of this great man, often impressed with the beautiful passages which so frequently occur, and with the vastness of his store of knowledge, I cannot think he deserves the very high encomiums and unbounded praises so lavishingly bestowed.  There is altogether too much gross vulgarity.  True, this is strictly in accordance with human nature among the lower orders; but he has represented the most noble gentlemen and ladies in conversations in which neither gentleman or lady would engage with one of the opposite sex.

The aim of his discourse appeared to be the reproving of covetousness, vainglory, connection of church and state &c.  He was very impressive, but, like all zealots in behalf of a particular creed, he seemed to deny that any other denomination preached the Gospel - his church being the only one in which it was to be found in its purity. This he implied, although not directly asserted. It appears to me, that such preaching is wanting in one of the main principles of the Gospel - charity. He is, however, a good man, notwithstanding his bigotry, and errs ignorantly.

Rather a warm day. fine shower at night . I did not go to meeting. Read Pastor's Sketches.\nMonday May 30\nMailed letters Home, to Mother M. and to Lucy Brigham. Sent them to Mt. Hawkins - by Skinner. Drew a picture down to the office.\nTuesday - cut out shirt. Called on Mrs. Keyes and we together went to Mrs. Roots a few moments - looked at her flowers - visited the sport, prettily  and touchingly decorated with running roses turning honeysuckle Willow & Cypress where her husband lies.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":99109,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/99109","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/172d5e7d5f4091834d2b89c27621d9a3.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/172d5e7d5f4091834d2b89c27621d9a3.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/172d5e7d5f4091834d2b89c27621d9a3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/172d5e7d5f4091834d2b89c27621d9a3.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T21:19:24+00:00","modified":"2020-07-22T05:13:31+00:00","filename":"172d5e7d5f4091834d2b89c27621d9a3.jpg","authentication":"b7609554aef5f3de2973724d85171aa4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_05_fl_120_001_128_o2.jpg","size":1095696,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2314,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.043843272832037},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180925"],"TimeCreated":["134901"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 5 Folder"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180925"],"TimeCreated":["134901"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 5 Folder"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180925"],"TimeCreated":["134901"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 5 Folder "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"172d5e7d5f4091834d2b89c27621d9a3.jpg","FileDateTime":1587331013,"FileSize":1095696,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2314\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2314,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:12:06 16:37:22","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:09:25 13:49:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:09:25 13:49:01","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":1.75,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":85,"SubSecTimeOriginal":57,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1942,"ExifImageLength":3020,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803254,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["85\/1","85\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF85mm f\/1.8 USM"}}}},"item":{"id":1245,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1245","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"wi' her needle and her sheers.\nGod's ould class look ancient as weel's the new;\n___\n\"If one for whom Satan hath struggled as he hath for me, Should ever much that blissful shore!

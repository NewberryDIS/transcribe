I shall not have anything to write I fear that will be very interesting to you. A journal, of such common events and from such a pen as mine will I fear merit but little of your attention, but if you will promise that no eyes but yours shall see this, I will do the best that I can hoping that wherein I fail your better judgement and kindness will allow you to correct me. I shall commence on the 18th of May 1841. After a painful parting with you and our friends we retired to the cabin which we found nearly full of Irish Dutch or English, who were preparing their supper, which they spread upon the cabin table and eat with much apparent enjoyment. We took tea with the Captain whom we found to be quite a jovial sort of a man. he told us that he was going to take his wife on board, as soon as he came to his farm which lay on the banks of the river, and give her a sail for her health, and she would be some company for us. We did not, however, reach the farm before night and were thus deprived of the lady's society. Her health not permitting her to venture out at so late an hour. The steamboat on which we sailed was called the Commerce and at that time had five boats in tow which were well laden and prevented our going fast. We retired at an early hour with severe headaches which after a night of sound sleep was entirely dispersed. \n19th When we arose we found that we had proceeded but unknown toward Troy, You will remember that when we left N.Y. we unknown rain at least every other day.

The scenery along the river at this time of the year was indeed beautiful. \nThe many farms, landings or villages formed as many a handsome scene \nfor a frontier. We arrived at the highlands about dusk, which seen in \nthe twilight appeared very gloomy and yet subblime. They cast a long shadow \nin the water, which was quite calm and smooth, making it appear as black \nas night. We watched a long time to catch a glimpse of the Anthony's nose, which \nis a point in the rocks, said to bear an exact resemblance of a man's Nose. \n20th We were awakened about three, with the news that the boat would \nland in Albany, which we did not expect. We were soon prepared to go \non shore, and leaving our baggage on board to proceed to Troy, we proceeded to \nMrs Moseleys in Hamlinton St at the foot of which we were landed. We found \nnone of them up, but soon aroused them. We took breakfast and then \ncalled on Mrs Cordell, whom we found very well, and busy preparing and\npainting.

After purchasing what\ngoods we wanted we went to his house and took dinner. before this however, \nPapa had been to Troy and back, having seen our goods and baggage on \nboard of a canal boat and engaged our unknown.

Amongst the passengers that come on board\nthere was one family who were inclined to be very sociable, they very soon\nlet us know that they were going to Milwaukee, that they had lived there\nfor two years, and had been east about 6 months on a visit, that they\ntook a cabin passage before but thought they would take a deck on this\ntime and ever so much more. finally we told them where we come from\nthey said they knew a woman by the name of Potter who came from Rhode\nIsland, after asking some questions we found it to be Lydia  Koppin? and\nher husband from Providence. We sent our respects to them and they\nsaid they would give them. Another extremely talkative person on board\nwas a lady traveling with her sick sister the first we knew of her she\ncame and carried off our stool which we soon took again, then she came \nto borrow our key to the door which of course we did not lend. we did not \nlike her appearance and therefore said but little to her. In the afternoon\nMrs Smith & I were sitting together talking when she came and seated\nherself close by us and the following conversation ensued. To Mrs smith. Do you \nmake your own dresses? No. Have you any patterns of this? No. How wide\nis this ruffle? You can measure it. Will you alow me to examine your \ndress a little, I used to be a dress maker and meant to have got me some patterns\nbut I forgot it? Oh! Yes. She then looked and measured for about 10\nminutes and then went away without thanking Miss S for being so \npicked to pieces. The weather was very warm & pleasant in the afternoon\n4th When I woke I found the boat was just leaving a place called \nBig river. About noon we landed at Cleveland Ohio. but could not \nsee much of the place except a few cottages on the hill. I spent the day in\nsewing and finished off my checked dress. About sunset we arrived in \nDetroit where the boat lay all night. In the evening we all walked\nround the City. There are some very handsome buildings and some of the\nstreets look very pretty but I did not like the looks of the place much.\n5th very pleasant. We started about 8 and passed through St Clair"

I have not eat in more \nthan a week. half of what I have eat at one meal I don't have any appetite. \nOllivier has gone home to day on Charley but is coming by night. Papa has \nstarted for Rockford so as to be there in season tomorrow. Cleveland has \nthreatened two or three times to get him off the jury by presenting some criminal \nfault of his of which he was guilty in Brooklyn time will show what that great fault is \nAfter Paper & Oliver were gone I commenced reading the Lady of the Lake. In the \nafternoon Uncle Charles & Aunt Abby took a stroll? round the farm. Charley was \ndressed as nice as you please but Aunt A had on one of those indigo blues spotted \nwith white and Mama's old hood which we sent out here. I should think she \nwould be ashamed to wear it for my part. After they came back the children \nwent to walk so Caroline & Dick, thought they would go too. when they came \nback they had some wild flowers which they had gathered which were very pretty. \nThe day has been very warm and pleasant toward night, I went out to the \nstocks and walked round a little looked at the calves & which looked \nfat and well. Before Papa went away Davis told him, there there was a man \ncame yesterday and drove away one of Papa's steers saying that it was his.  At night \nwhen Olliver came home Uncle C. took much pains to come and tell him \nthe same story. Charley said of course Mr Lockett would not call on him for \na witness because he would take a false oath. he said he was down there with \nthe man and saw him drive the steer off. He said too that if one of his Oxen should \ngo off and be gone a fortnight, he would not take his oath that it was his Ox for \nthere might be one exactly like it somewhere else, All these speeches and many \nothers the unnatural anxiety he show a about the steer struck me as being \nvery suspicious and I have a notion that Charly is at the bottom of the \nsteers going off. After Charly got through Erastus came and talked on the \nsame subject, repeating what Charles said about his being shown them &e\nErastus said it was the strangest thing he ever heard of for the man \ndescribed the marks on the steer which were just like those on ours (By the \nway I believe he had them described to him first) I think it is the most \nsurprising that Erastus thinks so strange of it for last summer they had \na yoke of steers go off and they heard of a man that had them, Erastus \nI think went too see them. When he came home he said they were as \nnear alike as they could be and he should think they they were the same but the \nman said they were not, and they afterward found their steers somewhere \nsomehow, put it all together and it looks suspicious. Olliver borrowed \nShakespeare of Mr. Bushnell for me and this evening I commenced \nreading the merry wives of Winsor"

This morning Olliver \nhad to go to Mr Fritz for some potatoes, so Mama got him to go to Mrs Bothers? \nwho is in unclear and got me some Lobelies?. After he got back and brought \nit and went to the claim to plant his potatoes I went to work with fear& \ntrembling to take it. I took a tea spoon full in warm water which I had \nno sooner swallowed though it put me in a violent pain which lasted scratched out  \nshort time. I was to take another spoonful in 15 minutes if the first did not vomit me \nbut I could not muster courage. in about  an hour I commenced vomiting, it brought \nbile as though it had gone too the spot?.  but I took so little that it did not vomit \nme much. I have been sorry ever since that, I did not take any more. It is the most \npowerful stuff that I ever took it makes one feel sick to the ends of their fingers and \ntoes When I felt smart enough I read Shakespeare. Mama washed. Caroline and \nDick spent most of the day in playing out of doors. Dick took his wagon and \ndrew wood &  chips for us, he goes whistling along, or trying too so happy as anything.

Olliver went into Aunt Abbys \nToday the court sets and I have not heard that Charley has got Papa off of the jury yet \n12th  Today after eating a slight breakfast I dressed to go to the claim on old Charley \nwho Oliver saddled and bridled. I  rode over as far as the saw mill with Olliver \nwho went on foot. here I left him to gallop Charly to see how I liked him. I think he \ntrots a littler easier than Jim and gallops  about the same though he is not so \nwilling to gallop as Jim is , he seems to prefer trotting, when I got to the claim I \ndismounted  to look at my garden. I found my unclear in bloom, my daisies \nblue bells sweet williams  &c doing first rate, my Rhubarb or unknown as they call it \nhere had leaves on it as large as my hand. my surge and columbine too were \ngrowing finely and my boxwood is all full of new leaves. I have 6 roots of it \nmy rose bushes and pinks do not appear to have started at all I am afraid \nthem and the grapevines will die, after I had looked at the house which has one \nend all sided and the paint on the other I proceeded to Mrs Stevens. After hitching \nmy horse I went in and took off my things. he did not seem to like to stand in the \nhot sun very well all saddled so Mrs Stephens told I had better take off his things \nand let him loose in the yard for he would do no hurt. I according did so, just \nat the moment Mr Gould A man that was at work for Mr Stephens came \nfrom the spring with a young rattle snake he was about 2 fingers long, he would \nstick up his tail and try to rattle though he had no rattles to rattle and then he \nwould jump at us and try to bite. My horse stayed round in the yard very peacibly till \nabout noon he took a notion to jump over the fence and was over and half a mile \noff before we could say Jack. Mr Stephens immediately set off for him but, as this was the \nfirst time he had been loose since last fall so that he felt extremely antic and \nit was a long time before they caught him finally he ran down by our claim and Mr S \nand Olliver above him under some stables where they caught him. Mr S then brought \nhim back tied him and then started for the teritory where he is at work cabinet \nnailing. About the middle of the afternoon I got ready to go home and went and \nbegan to pat Charley, who was as gentle as you please. Mr Stephens then came out to put on \nhis martingales when he stuck up his head as high as he could get and would not \nlet her touch him he pull back so hard as to pull four large rails to which he was tied \noff from the fence and draged them across the yard when he broke his halter and \nscampered off to the other side of the yard he stopped and looked round.

After a little practise in this manner, will be found almost impossible to let the foot drop, without making two taps. Practise this with each foot."

After practise, you will be able to make two short, distinct taps, without forcing the foot upon the floor. \nNote. (In teaching this class of dancing you will find it necessary to give exercises to hold the feet in, as pupils are apt to extend the foot from 6 to 10 inches forward obtaining same results in tapping, but preventing their improving in rapid execution.

It mattered not that they were all precisely alike in form; we gave them different names, and it was wonderful to see the changes so produced in their appearance. The red and white strawberries also, that abounded there, afforded us no small sources of pleasure. Many is the overflowing handful I have plucked of them, and many the sweet mouthful I have eaten.

The driver very kindly assisted me to mount.  The ends of the logs formed the steps by which I ascended, and though they were not so graceful or easy of ascent as might be, they answered my purpose very well.  I was soon as comfortably seated on the uncouth looking logs, with a horse blanket cushion, as if I were on a velvet cushioned seat in a costly carriage.  I sat with my side towards the horses heads, and my face turned to the village before us.  Everything seemed anxious to render happiness.  Perhaps this appeared so to me, because I was just in the mood to be pleased.  But aside from my feelings the sight was truly pleasing.  Only the tops of the village houses could be seen from whose chimneys the smoke went up, curling gently through the air.  The snow fell so softly, that instead of dazzling or bewildering the sight it lent a beauty to the air through which we looked, making what was always admired appear still more lovely and over that, which like the rough rail fences, was really homely, it threw a mantle so pure and graceful, that we could not but call it beautiful.  Lightly and merrily it danced around the hills and forest beyond the village dusting them over with white.  My favorite hill was in its prime. Its form, the same as ever, arose like a pyramid, higher than any other eminence around, and its crowning tree still stood erect upon the top.  But it seemed to have a more than usual beauty"

There was meaning in that smile, so cheerful yet so full of pity?, I felt, though she was but a child, that I was in the presense of a [superior] being.

Mute with wonder I scarcely moved, and my gentle guide entering into all my rapture gazed upon my face with unclear eyes. Her soul lived not in solitude, but delighted to mingle with others. Were any happy, she rejoiced more than though hers was the good obtained; did any mourn, she loved to weep with them. There were many people gathered in the umbrageous groves that studded the isle. All happy in their various ways, seemed particularly to rejoice when they did their neighbor a favor. I was amazed to find no beggars, none destitute of life's comforts and necessaries, neither were there any who reveled in their abundance.

Sem? for Seminary? for a visit to Buckland a place wild and romantic in the extreme, and whose rugged hills presented to the world a noble woman of great power and wisdom, and whose well directed benevolence has greatly endeared her memory to those who yearly reap her bounty. Well provided with provision for so long a journey in the highest spirits we started, three carriages, well filled.

Surely it was cruel for the white man to drive him from this his happy home, this loved retreat. The sacred resting place of the honored forefathers, and where he too wished to lie. Coming ro North Hadly, we drove up to our teacher's home, staid a few minutes, obtained some water, saw one of the prettiest of babies, and then proceeded on our way.

Every one else has undisputed right to himself, the wife of his bosom and his own dear children but the slave wherever he may be, is robd of these inestimable blessings. He is exposed every hour to be torn from their fond embrace and sent hundreds of miles distant never, never to see them again in this world of sin and sorrow. But how cheering the thought if they love and serve the Lord Jesus Christ as many of them do he will save them and they will meet in heaven where \"the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest\" Oh happy time! when after dragging out their miserable lives beneath the scorching rays of a southern sun, they will meet to sing praises to God for his mercy in calling them from the bondage of sin to the glorious liberty of the gospel. The question comes to my mind where will the slaveholder be in that day? It is a solomn question indeed. If he does not repent he will in all probability have to stand at the left hand and the judge will say to him \"inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these my brethren ye did it unto me\" M. H.

First startled into existence by the power of an electrical machine in year 1790, my earliest recollections are connected with the laboratory of the chemist and I well remember with what joy and pride I was looked upon as the result of the onward march of science, and as the reward of the philosopher's patient investigation.

Mr. Roberts saw the danger\nand without knowing why the child was heedless\nof the jeapordy in which he placed his\nown life, rushed to the midst of the street\nsnatched up the little child and bore her\nsafely to the sidewalk [just] barely escaping with his\nown life. How did he thank God in gratitude\nwhen he looked into the smiling face of the little\ngirl and beheld it was his own daughter. Some\none asked him afterwards why he risked his\nlife in rescuing one whom he supposed to be a\nperfect. I knew [that] said he that the childs\nlife was as precious in the sight of its parents\nas was my own child to me. And that God speedily\nrewared him as he will every generous deed."

Thirteen years ago, all spotless and pure, fresh from her Maker's hand this sweet creature was placed in our happy circle.

Here, new faces were around me, I saw new customs, had new paths, new fears and hopes, and fears alternate, vexed my burdened heart, while every fresh perplexity, and many a fancied trial made it turn with earnest longing towards my distant home.

There was a charming re-treat near by, which bore the suggestive name of \"Love's Grotto\".

Worthy Treasurer was the next office to fill.  For this was chosen a young man whom for short we call Bill.  He sits on the left of our Chief, has W. T? on his sash and keeps our dues and fees, and in fact - all our cash.  Our Secretary Financial has a great deal of care but she is very hopeful and will not despair.  She thinks her friends cut? up a mean caper? when they appointed her to read the old paper there being no one who can better wield the pen.  Brother Price was elected to office again.  As Secretary he has acquired considerable renown.  He is honored with the assistance of the Belle of our town.  For Chaplain this term we have Brother Phillip Steuben, a minister of the gospel and one of the finest of men."

I gratefully sought a seat, determined not another time to stop for appearances. I saw many things of interest as we passed out of the city, queer trees, queerer houses, pretty children, homely children, some playing, some idling, all making wry faces at the cold, and nearly all, taking some little notice of us. The snow had crusted over the fields beautifully, and the bushes that had shaken off its flakes, and stood up black and bare, looked not unseemly. There were hills too, in the distance, whose mingled blue and white, I, of course, admired. But while taking note of all these things, thoughts of you?, of Father, of the sick and well at home kept mingling with those called up by the scenery. A strange sadness"

The impression it left was more like that of a delightful dream, than a real pleasure--Anna was telling me the other day how she used to love to get letters from home when she was in Whitesboro.  She says that always after receiving one, she would commence humming to herself, and would step around the room so much quicker than usual, that Mrs. Butler was very likely to remark how happy she seemed, before she was aware what she was doing.  So is the effect produced by anything so pleasant and trancient as your last visit was.  Hardly knowing why we feel happier and more merry than before, and the most natural thing in the world for me, at least to do, would be to skip across the floor singing, or, what is more in my way of business, talking gayly, without"

You may imagine how welcome it was. You ask how I spent thanksgiving. It was observed here generally. The practice I am told is very recent in the south. I attend service in the Episcopal church. The Pres. church was not open till evening. We had a very plentiful dinner. Another teach came that day. She rooms with me. I am becoming very much attached to her. She is a widow lady by the name of Rogers from St. Lawrence Co. She has one little son, 8 or 10 yrs old I think, who is at home with her parents. She came her the 2nd year after her husband died,"

Sarah weighs a few ounces over a but do not write when your head aches and do not write enough to make it ache now remember, my dear. Give much love to Father and brother and tell them we are happy. Sarah feels better to-day than she has in a long time she thinks she will gain again now. I wish Lewis would write to us. Give much love to him and Anna and Eddy too. Eddie we want him to write on the third of April. Love to cousin Mary and Letty? I will write to her as soon as I well can. Fanny was in here a little while ago and she wants me to tell you that little Fanny Strong wishes that you were here and sends you all the love she can dig up out of the ground. I must stop now dear - Cynthia"

It was at the Pres. church. Some of her pieces were good and well recited. On the whole, I enjoyed it much and found it a pleasant diversion.

The appropriation for the aid of colored schools has passed the city councils but much will depend upon the character of the Commissioners appointed to deal it out. There are a number of private schools in the city taught by colored persons. These will come in for a share of the funds, so that what is left to aid in the support of Northern teachers must be small.

It seemed very enviable as portrayed, and we could not fail to agree when he said that such a life was to be striven for even if it were transient = that it would be better once really to have lived and lost, than never to have lived at all, but that it was of far surpassing worth when we remembered that it would never end and that \"When we've been there ten thousand years Bright, shining, as the sun"

July 7th 1875\nMy very dear Mother\n\n    Again and again have I thought I would surely write you a letter, but some how fail to accomplish my intentions. I really wrote part of a sentence several days ago, and more than once have carried pencil and paper for days in my pocket, thinking that by little and little I might get one written; but I seem almost to have forgotten how to write. This mustn't pretend to be a letter, but can carry a little message of love. Your kind letter with P.? O. or. for $10. was received all right, and was very welcome. I am glad to have the money The girls had bought me a summer underskirt for which Mary gave out the money and I was glad to pay back. I send you a sample of a wrapper which by just taking my measure they got for me ready made. It is a luxury these warm days. Afternoons, this week I am wearing the skirt of my black alapaca [sic] dress, and a white sack of Mary's. The waist of my dress is pretty warm, but the skirt does nicely with this white one-- We had a nice long rain yesterday. The\n\nadded sideways, along left margin and top: in his bright happy home part of word lined out above! Mother dear, we love you tenderly, even though we seem heedless about sending frequent letters  Our thoughts go very often to the dear old home  Wm. and I are both having pretty good health this week.

I had dreaded the noise, and it was quite wearing, but less so than we had feared and the sky rockets which we saw from our seats on the balcony and for a while up on the roof, were beautiful.

It looks very pleasant but doesn't talk much.\n\n    Won't he write to us some time? Jennie and Anna deserve decided thanks for their letters. Tell Mary Jane I send an extra bunch of love to her in this.  We would be very glad to get a note from her.  Would like to be with you in church as our young friends are coming in.

There are many, and many injunctions given us to trust in the Lord and again and again are we told that they that trust in him need not be afraid. \"Trust in the Lord\" says David, \"so shalt thee dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be free.\" Let us then, dear sister trust implicit in him, with childlike faith, knowing that we shall not lack any"

Yesterday afternoon Miss Jencks and I took a pleasure walk, my first I think in Norfolk. I have had many pleasant ones before, however I enjoyed this one exceedingly. We went on Free Mason St. one of the pleasantest and widest in the city leading westward to the Elisabeth River. The sun was low and cast a lovely glow on the water. Across the river was Portsmouth where stood the marine hospital, a cool, roomy looking place; and out a little way in the water a light-house, many cornered, heavy looking, apparently able to breast many winds. Between us and Portsmouth anchored the New Hampshire on board which a marshall band was filling the air all about\nNow my dear what think you of my surroundings?  I might say further that the kitchen and a little store house beyond it was formerly separate from the main building after the fashion of southern houses.  What is now the back entry was made a room, after our northern friends came here by enclosing the piece of ground lying between the house and the kitchen.  But my sheet is full.  With much love and asking for another letter I close.\nCynthia"

As we neared Church St. (where we board) we passed a decrepit old negro leaning on two crutches and helping himself along as best he could. \"See that poor old man,\" said I. \"He's given the strength of his years to the white folks\" was Miss Jencks answer. I wanted to follow him to his home and see if he was comfortable there, but thought perhaps I could do nothing to make him more so, if he wasn't. So I hesitated till it was too late, and then was sorry I hadn't.\nYou ask about my room it is not in the garret though I suppose in the proper place for it and is up three flights of stairs, pretty long ones, so we try to save ourselves a frequent ascent.

We turned down a lane, he keeping near until we reached a new fence and gate enclosing a yard. Darting in like a shot from a gun he left me quite in the rear. As I followed, I saw him dart up to the furthest door of a snug unpainted little house and overheard the startling exclamation, \"The teacher's coming!\" There was a sudden movement, or a variety of them, but in a moment--he reappeared at the door saying \"come in Miss Everest.\" Obeying I saw the table spread for supper.

We had been looking for a letter for a long time, every night we thought we surly would get one that night but no, no letter came. You were not very well I fear. Mary will have to be very careful or she will be sick again. Miss Colagrove? finished a dress she was making for Sarah to night.  Cousin Elizabeth tried it on, it looked quite pretty. We have not heard from Sarah for some time,  but hope to soon.  Do please to forgive me for not answering your last note.  I have no excuse to give at all.  But I hope to be more punctual in answering your letters after this.  I can not see how I could let you stay there so long before I wrote one word.  Only think of it, Jane was gone almost a year and I did not even write one little note to her.  Jane appeared to be quite anxious we should study french, we have been trying to study it a little but did not make much headway at it though.  Edward Josiah says he will write as soon as he finds time.  He wants me to tell Jane \"they have to work hard all day from morning till night.  He has to set from a page and a half to ? pages a day.\"  The Cenhadwr  is just coming out and they have quite a busy time of it.  We had two weddings here last night.  A man by the name of Smith came first they came a little before six, we had not quite finished our supper.  They came rather sooner than we expected.  They did not stay but a very short time, just long enough to get tied together.  Then some time after they had been gone, some Thomas Evans from Penymynydd and Hannah Davis, David Davis' daughter came.  They were both Married in english.

There Mr. Strong kindly saw us on the train for Schenecteds, and after bidding us a hasty adieu, barely had time to jump on board the cars bound for Troy before we were all again in motion.  I had no trouble at all with my baggage and enjoyed my journey so much as I could wish to.  but was not sorry when we reached the City and could  give our bodies a little rest, and our stomachs too. for mine, at least was quite weary of digesting the sand and all manner of dust that was continually blowing in through the windows and forcing itself into our faces and mouths."

After dinner we went to the garden for a few moments and then, after having demolished the dust and sand that we had accumulated during the morning by means of a sufficient quantity of soap and water.  we laid down and did not rise again till tea time.  Amelia came with me to Roberts rooms in the evening.  Jennie had been down to the depot at noon time to meet me, but by that time had concluded that I was not coming that day and had gone out.  Tuesday morning I spent with cousin Mary at her boarding place enjoyed it much.  Ellen was quite well and playful.  In the afternoon I went to Jennie's school.  It rained when we were going and during the afternoon a good deal, but I was much interested and so it passed pleasantly.  I saw Amelia there.  she said Fannie had got well rested and was feelling well.

Thank you much for your letter which I received last Saturday night.  It was dated Oct 27.  I think we can appreciate, in a measure your letters.  They are more than common messages of love, for they are written in sickness, in weakness, when the use of the pen must cause some exertion -- We have reason to thank the Lord, that though he has brought you so low in weak and apparently so near the brink of the \"dark river\" he has yet spared your lives.  And he will, I trust strengthen you and once more, let you bathe in the river of health.  Dear ones all, how often the wish comes to us, that we could be with you and could comfort you and assist you a little -- I hope you have received that box ere this, I suppose Mary will tell you when it was sent.  It will do you no good for me to write surmises of how you are, and what you are doing, for you already know all about that.  But you have, I suppose no Oracle, who tells you how your home friends are occupied so perhaps a little news of them would be as acceptable as any thing I could write.  I say home friends which seems most like home to you, Remsen, or Kansas?  The Mountain Parsonage or your \"Snug House\"?  The \"home is where the heart is.\"  And though perhaps you each have your dearest friend by your side,sharing in  all your troubles, still do not your thoughts sometimes travel here?  Are not your hears or the love of your hearts often with us?  Why what is the matter with me?  I am asking you questions, instead of telling you of us.  Well, we often let our thoughts travel to you and sometimes suffer our imagination to picture your forms and home but we do not like to have it bring your sufferings before our eyes.

She seems to be particularly pleased with her situation, the people around here and most everything she mentions.  I received a letter last week from cousin Lizzie.  She wrote that she felt so sorry for you, and asked me to give you her love when I wrote to you.  She intends to come this way next Summer.  You have written to us that you gave wrong directions as to sending letters Tuesday but as we have not answered your letter before Monday night, I suppose it will do as well to send it to morrow, as to keep it longer.  Mary seems not.  Ah she is busy now, I was going to not doing much or something, so Lewis has been after a big load of tanbark and is now eating his supper together with Rev. Mr. Samuel who is staying with us to night, on our kitchen table, by which we (Anna and myself) are also writing.  Mary is sitting by, waiting on the eaters.  The table is drawn up to the stove.

Can you forgive me, and believe me when I say that it was not coldness, nor even forgetfulness that made me so delinquent. We all think and speak often of our relatives in the Old World, but somehow written communications between us have always been, like angel visits, \"few and far between.\" Cousin Margaret has recently favored us with a long and very interesting letter, and we have also had one from Aunt Jane Williams and her daughter Lizzie, which we have just answered, so that by it all, the ocean has ceased to seem such a great barrier, and all our friends on the other side have been brought nearer to us. Perhaps you have not felt it, but we have.\nleft side writing\nnature, or providence in nature, is very good to us. There seem to be many graces of the Spirit, which only come to any degree of perfection through long experience , and with such as have had a long and blessed christian experience with what luster do they sometimes shine. I hope I do not idolize my father, but sometimes I think I come pretty near it. Dear cousin, anything that you can write about your dear departed father will be of great interest to us. I hope that you will not fail to write soon, take warning by me, and do not begin to delay, and remember that any little incidents connected with life habits, climate or anything in England or Wales will be novel and pleasing to us. Our parents seldom seldom speak at any length of such things now so there would be no danger of your telling anything old. We would also like to hear anything connected with yourself or family. I suppose of course you are interested in our National Struggle. I have so little space left that I can only allude to it. It has been fearful and bloody, but we hope soon to see its end - and we confidently expect it will result in the fulfillment of our long, long, long indulged wish, and most fervent prayer that the foul system of slavery shall cease to defile our fair country. Oh! what a curse is cruelty, where ever it exists! My sisters and brothers, father and other all join one in love w yourself, your mother, and all our cousins. Remembe torn page ously look for a letter to assure me that my ingratitude and delay are forgotten. Affectionately your cousin Cynthia K. Everett"

(I hope it will not prove injurious) Next time, however, he is intelligible. Coming softly in at the door, he shakes hands, and says, \"doo mornin. doo mornin.\" I have a mind to send one of his good mornings to you. Perhaps that is what he wants. Are babies in Wales so bewitching, I wonder, as to win all hearts. They are here, at least ours is.\nGive our love and warmest sympathy to your dear mother, cousin Charles; we have always heard her spoken of as so gentle and mild, that we have learned to love her dearly. Cousin Margaret has written to us about the death of her two brothers. All these afflictions must sadden her life much, but we are glad to know by what Margaret writes that she is able to see the bright gleams in the darkness, and stay her"

You may be sure we were ] very glad to get it. Eddie dear, you needed not to be at all fearful of writing, though at so late a date. Better late than never you know.

But I am in a measure prevented from being homesick by the very frequent visits I have from you.

So far as I am concerned, I may say, that, when I came to Richmond, after having marched from Deep Bottom, to Hatchers Run, and from thence to before Petersburgh on the 2nd Apl? 1865, as well as having followed Gen Lee to Appomattux C.H., where he surrendered-- I was as ragged as a man ought to be, not because I had no means, (as Government owed me) but because I could not get it, This is the reason that the Chaplain Commission gave me your needle case, I could not purchase, the contents of such an article, for want of pay, and, the Commission kindly dealt out to me, that which might have been really intended for a more honorable recipient, Nevertheless, it was as duly appreciated by me, being in the employ of the government, though a Chaplain, as it would have been by the bravest and most worthy soldier in the army; therefore you may say to the \"Ladie's Aid Society of Steuben, Oneida Co, N, Y. that your needle case came safe to hand, to one who needed such an article; and to one who was most deeply interested in the well being and well doing of our soldiers, not forgetting an interest in the final triumph of our cause.\nSo far as I now remember, I distributed, among our soldiers, quite a number of articles sent by the \"aid Society, of Steuben\" and the \"Society\" may rest assured that the thanks of our boys were deeply felt, though you may not have heard yet from them, either by word or letter,\nThe fact, that these things were received, after the surrender of Lee, and while at Richmond, does not lessen the gratitude of those who shared in your benevolence, and for this reason-- that, though, the same? could have been had in the city, yet"

You may have forgotten what you wrote but, it is before me; it reads as follows, \"I have just been reading the 4th Chap of Colossians, and was so impressed with the 13th verse that I feel constrained to write it for you.  It is this \"I can do all things through Christ which strenghteneth me\". From this assertion, (as I suppose you endorse the truth) I take you to be a christian.  I do not say an Episcopalian, Presbyterian, Baptist, Methodist, or of any other sect or party but, simply a christian, not that any? or either of these should be discarded if honestly adhered to, but, I think you are, or wish to be numbered with those who believe the word of God to feel called upon to live a life of faith in the son of God.  If this is so as I do not doubt, then you must believe the quotation or passage above given in Colossians, Premising that you consent, with all your heart to the sentiment, as well as truthfulness of that passage, may I ask, if you can be made, or, make yourself holy now, through Christ!  If you hesitate & begin to make excuses, I fear there is a lack of faith on your part, and you let unbelief rob you of trying to see what you can do through Christ!!  Now, then, if you can do all"

My thoughts are not good for anything after the first effervesence and the cork is always drawn when I read a letter. Why should I wait when I want to write now? Will you think I have letter-writing on the brain? Will you think me tiresome? No! I have your truth loving face before my eyes this moment - and I have those two weeks in Utica hidden in my heart.

It seems as if I had somehow forgotten Jesus presence and only just-now remembered I should be ashamed to tell you what I was saying to M? only the day before yesterday about the gloom that covered everything.

Just so my soul reached out for Jesus the other night, and I found him, and I laid down to rest repeating mentally \"Take my yoke upon you and learn of me. for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls.\" It has seemed to me since I came home as if every one was playing on the naked nerve pulps of my soul unintentionally but none the less surely torturing me, and I really wondered at my cheerfulness and peacefulness.

Everett\nWe, the undersigned, Commissioners of Schools for the County of Oneida, earnestly solicit your attendance at the TEACHERS' INSTITUTE, to be held in the Court-House at Rome, in pursuance of Chapter 179, Laws of 1856, to commence on Monday, September 30, at 2 o'clock P.M., and to continue two weeks - five days in each week. \nArrangements have been made that Board can be had reasonable.\nProfessor C.T. POOLER will conduct the Class Drill.\nHon. E.W. KEYES, Acting State Superintendent\u00a0; Professor D.H. COCHRANE, Principal State Normal School\u00a0; President FISHER, and many other distinguished gentlemen, are expected to lecture before the Institute.\nWe would upon all Teachers, and those intending to teach a Common School, the importance of attending the Institute. Those having had the experience cannot fail to be benefited by an intercourse and acquaintance with each other, and by discussion of their various methods of teaching and governing. Those without experience and intending to teach, certainly need to avail themselves of every opportunity to qualify themselves for the responsibilities they are about to assume. Our Doctors, Lawyers and Divines spend years in thought and study to prepare themselves to practice successfully in their professions, yet none of these need a more thorough preparation before entering upon practice than the Teacher. The duty which binds every Teacher to elevate his profession - the sacred obligations we are all under to improve that sacred and hereditary institution, our Common School system - the momentous interests, both public and private, which depend upon the advancement of popular education amongst us - the blessing or the calamities to be bestowed or inflicted upon all posterity by our fidelity or our neglect - appeal to every Teacher in particular to promote every measure and embrace every opportunity which holds out a reasonable expectation of enhancing the prosperity and extending the blessing of our Common Schools. Had a similar Common School system to that of our own State existed in every State of our Union, that the whole people could have read and understood their own true interests, that awful calamity that now threatens to overwhelm us as a nation could never have happened.\nAs only such Teachers as attend the entire term can be reported as a basis upon which to draw from the funds granted by the State, we hope all Teachers may be present and report themselves on the first day of the meeting. It will be well for each Teacher to bring an Arithmetic, a Grammar, and if convenient, Sanders' Fifth Reader.\nDated at Utica, the 2nd day of September, 1861.\nH.E. WILCOX, \nP.B. CRANDALL,\nJ.H.

Sometimes I feel very much discouraged having the same routine from week to week, but the best way to do is to do the best you can today, and let tomorrow take care of itself.  All of our class are well.  I suppose you have heard that Miss Wood has left us on account of the death of her father; it was a sore misfortune to us to have both teachers leave us at one time, but we had to do the best we could.  Our exercise for tomorrow is, to write a description of what we saw today, in the form of a letter and give it to Mrs Warren to be corrected.  All the family are well and send their \"well wishes\" to you.  We have a holiday today, it being Washingtons birthday.

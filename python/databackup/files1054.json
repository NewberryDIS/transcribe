If they went quite round so as to return to the place from where they started in the diamond, they would return safe: but if they stopped on the way round & vanished, they were to die. So also with regard to persons going off on any other business. Some had a peculiar kind of very thin stones, of a whitish colour, these they took to a stream of water, prayed to the beings named above, and then threw the stones on the water. If they swam off some distance, and then returned to the shore before sinking, all would be well. But if they sunk before they reached the shore, the person, or persons on whose behalf they were used would die, & not return. The stones also, when the person or persons were to die, turned, it is said, to a bloody colour. During the day, all concerned, fasted, except as they drank some of the water of conjuration from the creek. \n  Others again had a small, but very curious trough, holding about a gill, filled with water. In this they put two grains, resembling grains of powder.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70715,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70715","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/66525170182c113500e3919726f3847b.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/66525170182c113500e3919726f3847b.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/66525170182c113500e3919726f3847b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/66525170182c113500e3919726f3847b.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:43:53+00:00","modified":"2020-09-03T21:39:19+00:00","filename":"66525170182c113500e3919726f3847b.jpg","authentication":"809d23f0ce22c63193dbc4beb2d99465","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL013_00018_o2.jpg","size":577439,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2937,"compression_ratio":0.036408971109346},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["020537+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["020537+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["020537+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"66525170182c113500e3919726f3847b.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424621,"FileSize":577439,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2937\"","Height":2937,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2937,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:11:50","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4114},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 02:05:37","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 02:05:37","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":15,"SubSecTimeDigitized":15,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2937,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1054,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1054","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"540\n\nWhen warriors had killed any person, or touched a dead body, or a bone of a dead person, they were unclean four days; they took a certain drink to puke them washed or bathed the whole body; and must not sleep with their wives for seven nights, and in case a warrior was wounded, he could not sleep with his wife for twenty nights.\nThe rules with regard to touching a grave, were the same as touching a dead body.

In some of their ancient prayers, they speak of the sun as a male, & consider, of course, the moon as a female. In others, however, they represent the sun as the female & the moon as the male: for this reason they say, because the moon travels, is wakeful, etc in the night. Another reason probably operated to bad bade them to reject the ancient opinion viz. The unwearied? attention of the sun to the necessities of the earth, in bringing forward all its productions, etc. and also the supposed creative power of the sun in forming all things, except the earth and the man & woman. Thus the sun is called the creator in all their ancient prayers, that is, when they speak of this creator they mean the sun. In one of their most ancient prayers to be repeated early in the morning, when going to the water, they pray to the creator for a long & happy life here as this will be their only place of happiness, and some add a request to this creator to take their spirit, and carry it with him (her) till he (she) arrives at the meridian (till noon) and then give it back to them. This prayer, excepting the last clause, is also repeated at night. They also use this expression in their prayers. A ke yu ku go.

For the same reason also hunters waved their mockasins & legings over the fire. \n\n  Some Cherokees give the following account of their sacred fire. After their arrival on this continent, from beyond the sea, they sent back for some of their sacred fire, which existed there, an active intelligent agent in the form of a man. Accordingly a little of this fire was taken from that man of fire & conveyed over the water by a spider which wrapped it in her web.  When they got this fire, they kept it always in their council house, that is, in a hole or cave dug under the council house. (Others say this fire originally came down from heaven.) Their council house was eventually taken by their enemies, & destroyed, but they suppose the fire is still in the hole under ground where they left it. \n  Having lost this sacred fire, they endeavored to remedy the evil by making new fire. Taking two pieces of [Wawhod?] Basswood, they put a weed called gold rod, between them & then rubbed them swiftly against each other till the weed, & wood took fire. Among the Creeks, & perhaps among ancient? Cherokees, all the fire was extinguished every year, about the commencement of autumn & new fire made. Among the Cherokees new fire was made at the commencement, & used during every war, or hunting expedition. Also when a person died, all the old wood and fire were taken out of the house, & new fire made as above. Their prayers are often addressed to the fire.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70735,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70735","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/25e799aa0aed59abb17db5907c9b1270.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/25e799aa0aed59abb17db5907c9b1270.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/25e799aa0aed59abb17db5907c9b1270.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/25e799aa0aed59abb17db5907c9b1270.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:44:12+00:00","modified":"2020-09-03T21:39:19+00:00","filename":"25e799aa0aed59abb17db5907c9b1270.jpg","authentication":"4c8ebb6842ea26d311fc343bcc31e0b4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL014_00006_o2.jpg","size":637876,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2966,"compression_ratio":0.039826427911391},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["021954+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["021954+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["021954+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"25e799aa0aed59abb17db5907c9b1270.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424622,"FileSize":637876,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2966\"","Height":2966,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2966,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:12:00","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5020},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 02:19:54","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 02:19:54","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":76,"SubSecTimeOriginal":76,"SubSecTimeDigitized":76,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2966,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1054,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1054","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"\"Copied\" written vertically across center of page\n\n                                                                                                                              566                                                                                          7\n\nbe permitted to cross, but on arriving at the other side they would be put in a house of fire and transfixed with large iron spikes, & thus tortured forever. \n\n   Just before sun set, the priest offered sacrifice of meat, sprinkling on the fire Old Tobacco.

A certain man and his wife had two sons - twins. The raising of  corn was then unknown, yet the woman used to go into a certain house daily, and fetch corn & cook for her family. At length the boys watching her, discovered that she went into the house and prayed, and the corn fell from her. They then determined to kill her, & gave her notice of their intentions. She then told them that if they did kill her, they must drag her body about on the groung ground?, corn would spring up which they must tend, & thus raise corn for themselves. They accordingly did so, and for this first time corn grew from [the?] earth. But the mother, after being thus? dragged about came to life and went? above. The boys also soon became tired of life and went up. Since then this woman has been honored as a goddess.

We had left business unfinished at the Agency to return home, and set his family on the move for Ross' Landing, where, after finish his business at the Agency, he was to meet them and take a water passage to the Arkansas.

commenced the above long section, I was devising means to procure you some further help in your work, but soon stray in on the cares and anxieties of Mr. Ross endeavoring to show the favorable reasons of his not having written you. I will now return and say, I will write to Mr. Butrick, transcribing that part of your letter relating to the History. He and Lady went with a company of Cherokees conducted by Mr. Richard Taylor.That Company, with a number of others, probably mounting in the whole to twelve  or thirteen. Thousands of persons, has, as I understand, pitched their tents near the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, not being able to cross on he account of ice.  As I do not know where to address Mr. Butrick in that region, I will direct a letter to the Arkansas, that he may meet it on his arrival. I do not wait for your approbation of this movement, as the time has already passed, by which you wished to place your History before the public, and, your many hours brought it into a form in which you have done it, ere this and if so, Mr. Butrick send you further documents, they can probably be used in some way, for the benefit of the Indians. I will ask him to consult with Mr. Ross and ascertain whether he has taken any measures to assist you since his return from Washington. If I have an opportunity, I will also inquire of  Mr. Jones respecting the part he promised you. His time unclear completely occupied in assisting the Cherokees and has unclear now with unclear.

He thought he accomplished only about half his journey; but as they had crossed all the mountains and rivers. They were hoping to proceed with more rapidity. He expects to return to this country for his family, by water. \n\n    It is not my province to meddle with the affairs of Congress, but it appears to me if speedy relief is not granted, this interesting people must perish from the earth. One eighth have already gone down to the grave, since the 23rd of last May. And the number that is now dying, and  the distress of the living, while on the journey, with what they will doubtly be obliged to suffer, when they arrive in their new country, ought to stir up our Government to their effectual relief. I have heard of the number of deaths from only four companies since they left. Two of these, each containing about eleven hundred persons, had buried between fifty and sixty persons in each. Another with about one thousand persons had lost fifty two, and thirty eight from another, which, numbers seven hundred and fifty. These deaths had occurred when they had arrived, not quite half way. Unless the distress of this people are brought before the rulers of our Nation, how can they feel on this important subject and who\n\nwill bring up these distresses, but the friends of the Indians? -- and how can the friends of Indians do it, unless they can obtain a knowledge of the need. We must expect people in this region, will sish to draw a veil over the miseries which have resulted from this oppression, or as they  often do attribute them to Indian stubbornness  in not living according to the stipulations of the treaty.

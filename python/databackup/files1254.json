H. Mr Bouton, 26th Anniversary sermon, from Col. 1.10\nConsider some things important to promote true spirituality in the church. 1. They must be united. 2 They must be pure, that the world may not point in derision to any member, as a unclear to the cause of Christ. 3. Fervent prayer and active labor. The true disciple will work for his Master. 4. Reverence for the Sabbath. 5. Regular attendance on all religious meetings during the week as well as on Sabbath. No trifle should detain. A few clouds, a chilling wind or the hot sun of summer, these do not keep me from worldly business with should they from the Sabbath holy observance. 6. Proper discharge of family duties. And 1.

He died for sinners, for those even who were his murderers. It was love and good will to all which led him to give his life to save poor ruined man.\n3. Delight in the character of God & in communion with him is an evidence of christian character. We must love to go to God and tell him our need, and our sorrows, and joys, as to a dearly loved friend.\n4. The christian loves God's word. It is his daily meditation. He \"longs for its precepts\".

The Resolution respecting School Committee was there again reformed.\nFriday 31st.\nThe following objections were recd from the Principal Chief to the Resolution passed by the Two House the present session, regulating the issuing of permits.\nunclear Lewis Ross Presdt Comm                 Head of Coosa CN Oct 1828\nSo I returned you in yesterday the resolution regulating the issuing of permits to and not being prepared, from the sudden manner in which I was called home, to state the objections, which influenced me in disapproving it, I will now give you a brief statement. In the first place I am inclined to believe that the that the tax required to be paid, the length of time that one should be compelled to take on permit for, & the condition of giving bond & security, would all go to operate with the felling of some of our people, so as to employ whitemen without permits, and hazard the risk of being returned to count & fined according to law. - You will see that their late resolution imposes no penalty for hiring without permit, & you will further see that the law imposing a penalty for such offence leaves not, then obvious, that a great many of our citizens would live without permits, & rather pay the Ten Dollars than to be forced in the sum prescribed in this resolution? In the second place, I am of opinion that the expense of removing the white people who may be introduced into this nation under permits should not altogether fall upon the nation or the sheriff; but the employer, or the obstinate white man should pay the necessary expence of removal. I consider this subject one of great importance, and that it is highly necessary we should guard against being overburdened with temporary citizens of this character. And at the same time, we should not suffer the improvement of the mechanical art, to languish through a contracted policy of legislation. There for I respectfully submit the subject for your reconsideration. \nYour servant, John Ross.\nThe resolution was then taken up & read with the objections. On motion of Jos Daniel, the resolution was laid on the table to be read again on Monday next.\nMonday 3rd Nov:\nThe house met agreeably to adjournment. - The resolution regulating the issuing of permits was takin up and read the Second time, with the objections thereto made by the principal Chief. David Vann moved that the resolution be so amended that the tax of five dollars for each permit be reduced to one dollar & in proportion for unclear a greater length of time. Jos Vann (Coosawattie) moved that the tax remain at what it is, for one year; and for 6 months, be $3, & for 3 months, $2, & that no permits be issued for a less term than 3 months.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71176,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/71176","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/4fd17ddcd113b128369307d11969826f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/4fd17ddcd113b128369307d11969826f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/4fd17ddcd113b128369307d11969826f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4fd17ddcd113b128369307d11969826f.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T16:04:19+00:00","modified":"2020-03-21T16:52:55+00:00","filename":"4fd17ddcd113b128369307d11969826f.jpg","authentication":"f3dda823b8bd4587288d20f0c4690654","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL07_FL006_00007_o2.jpg","size":897981,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2936,"compression_ratio":0.056639229488344},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["124701+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["124701+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["124701+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4fd17ddcd113b128369307d11969826f.jpg","FileDateTime":1522425844,"FileSize":897981,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2936\"","Height":2936,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2936,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:15:18","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4876},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 12:47:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 12:47:01","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":32,"SubSecTimeDigitized":32,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2936,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1057,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1057","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The ayes and nays being taken were as follows: for David Vann's amendment II: for Jos Vann's 4.

honours on a subject in which we believe the intent of this nation is deeply involved. The subject to which we respectfully solicit your attention, is the resolution passed by the General Council of the Nation on the 24th of October 1827, requiring the Treasurer to call in all the money loaned under the provision of a previous act, on or before the first Monday of Oct 1828.\nWe hope this will not be viewed as casting reflections on the Honorable Members of the General Council, by whom the above recited resolution was formed, for we are well assured that the Loan Bank was highly commendable: _ the object was for a general good, to augment the national fund, and to circulate money amongst the citizens of this nation. But we do most sincerely believe that if immediate collections of the loaned money are made, which will have to be done by co-ercion, it will be highly impolitic & injurious to many of our most respectable & efficient citizens & create great dissatisfaction generally. The dispensation given for payments was too short, & at a time when money cannot be fairly realized. The fact is, we do not believe that there is money enough in the nation, to pay the money due to the Bank; consequently the property of the debtors of securities will have to be sacrificed, and the nation probably will lose a great part of the loaned money. Now we leave this subject to your good sense to judge whether all this would not prejudice & embitter the minds of our people against our government.\nIn view of these serious evils and the severe trials which now await us on every hand, _ and, also, considering that it is not indispensably necessary that all","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71182,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/71182","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b406b8bd3f24cc245cf775831a418ca8.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b406b8bd3f24cc245cf775831a418ca8.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b406b8bd3f24cc245cf775831a418ca8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b406b8bd3f24cc245cf775831a418ca8.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T16:04:25+00:00","modified":"2020-03-24T21:51:53+00:00","filename":"b406b8bd3f24cc245cf775831a418ca8.jpg","authentication":"91b0d39f0c6cfb03dfc3f72c36202154","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL07_FL006_00011_o2 copy.jpg","size":754955,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2910,"compression_ratio":0.048043464426626},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["124811+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["124811+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["124811+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b406b8bd3f24cc245cf775831a418ca8.jpg","FileDateTime":1522425844,"FileSize":754955,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2910\"","Height":2910,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2910,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:15:21","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4592},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 12:48:11","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 12:48:11","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":34,"SubSecTimeDigitized":34,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2910,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1057,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1057","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"that all the money loaned out of the National Treasury should be immediately collected.

This policy on the part of the President, to evade a direct reply, is no less astonishing than unjust, because the communication embraced several subjects of new occurrences,which had never been laid before the government.  The Delegation, under these circumstances, were then induced to draw up & lay before the Congress a Memorial, praying that measures may be taken for relief of our sufferings,- but, owing to the multiplicity of businesses before Congress and the shortness of its session, our friends did not succeed in bringing our affairs to a final issue, -

friends\nIt affords me great pleasure to see you here, previous to  the time for the meeting of the next General Council. You have been invited hither not for the object of legislation, but merely for the purpose of a consultation: the Executive does not possess the power of convening the General Council at any other place than at the seat of government established by our constitution; but understanding that a difference in opinion prevails among you, on the subject of holding the next general council at that place it was deemed proper to invite you together previous to the time fixed by the constitution for convening the General Council, that you may have a friendly interchange of sentiment with each other on the subject, and to act with a unison & harmony of feeling on so important an occasion. The constitution under which we have been elected, and which we have sworn to support, prescribes our respective duties & plainly exhibits the path blazed out for us to travel; a wanton departure from the principles therein contained may lead to confusion and the disorganization of our system, and perhaps to our national ruin. In reviewing the present condition of our national affairs and determining the course to be pursued, we should not do it superficially, but the survey should be thoroughly made, that all the bearing may be clearly seen, and evil avoid. _I am happy in the opinion that our country's cause is still gradually advancing by gaining friends and supports abroad and notwithstanding the oppressive acts which our opponents are adopting against us. The continuance of a peaceable, firm and prudent course on our part, cannot fail to crown our efforts in the maintenance of our rights, with sucess. Therefore, let harmony and union be our motto, and I earnestly beseech you to beware of innovations & disorganization.\nYour friend\nJohn Ross.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71206,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/71206","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d17c50aa8e751d88f7454dfab55550d8.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d17c50aa8e751d88f7454dfab55550d8.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d17c50aa8e751d88f7454dfab55550d8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d17c50aa8e751d88f7454dfab55550d8.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T16:04:47+00:00","modified":"2020-03-27T16:58:07+00:00","filename":"d17c50aa8e751d88f7454dfab55550d8.jpg","authentication":"0b54836ff750421d2afdb97e32225fbf","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL07_FL008_00006_o2.jpg","size":710491,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2900,"compression_ratio":0.045369795657727},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["125522+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["125522+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["125522+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d17c50aa8e751d88f7454dfab55550d8.jpg","FileDateTime":1522425845,"FileSize":710491,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2900\"","Height":2900,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2900,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:15:32","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4080},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 12:55:22","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 12:55:22","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":16,"SubSecTimeDigitized":16,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2900,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1057,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1057","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Messrs John Martin\nJohn Ridge\n&                                                       Head of Coosa C.N.\nWm S.

He said the letter was handed him by Mr Trolt; - likewise informed me that all the prisoners except yourself & Mr Worcester had accepted reprieves.  I let him pass without farther inquiries, not doubting but your letter would give me information of your situation; but, on reading it, found nothing written respecting what took place after your arrivaling Milledsville?.  I tried to wait patiently till yesterday, when I sent John Wane to the Port office, but again found myself disappointed; for there was no letter from my husband.  A multitude of anxious thoughts rushed into my mind.  I concluded you were not able, or not permitted to write.  After some reflection, thought best to come to the conclusion that an indirect route from Milledsville? to this place occasioned the delay.  With this conclusion, I shall write a letter as I get time, & try to wait patiently till I hear from you.  \nOct 5.  Our neighbors have called and given me messages for you.

As I was well acquainted with all the natives in that settlement, I went with him to their different residences & we got off about six miles, to one Bullard's who kept handy for sale, where there were several Cherokees. Curry treated the company, and commenced drinking himself & got very drunk & then mounted his horse & started off? yelling, and got off about a mile & fell off of his horse, and I, then with the assistance of some Cherokees, took him upon his horse & mounted the horse behind him, & rode & carried him on before me, on to my house, a distance of five miles, and Robbin Fields led the horse by the bridle, and he remained speechless until about midnight.

Justice, however, to ourselves and the nation, require it of me, at least, to say, that peace & friendship with all persons abroad, & brotherly kindness & affectionate attachment towards each other among our fellow countrymen, have ever been our ardent desire; and our public counsels to the people, bear witness to the truth of this declaration. And if such desires & inculcations have not been fully realized, nor altogether successful, - but, on the contrary, if differences of opinion, excitement, or strife, have arisen between individuals, or murder been committed upon each other from any cause whatsoever, - whilst we lament the occurrence of events so deplorable, we have the consolation to know that we have neither perpetrated, nor instigated, nor approved them.\nIt will be recollected that at the last session of the Legislature of Georgia, a law was passed, calculated, and, no doubt, designed, to oppress & injure those of our citizens residing within the chartered limits of that state, by authorising the Governor to issue grants for certain lots of land in their occupancy, and also by appointing a special agent for the enforcement of that abominable law. But thro' the advice of our counsellors at Law, injunctions were applied for and granted by Judge Hooper, one of the Circuit Judges of Georgia, and the case was argued before his Honor the Judge at a Special Court some time last Spring, who confirmed his previous opinion on the subject, but consented to refer the whole case to the Convention of Judges, who met at Milledgesville in July last ?. It is gratifying to say that the Convention, with the exception of but two dissenting opinions, sustained our right of occupancy upon broad principles; - and in the courts recently held in this country, the injunctions have been perpetuated by Judge Hooper.\nThere have been three cases decided against our citizens before these courts, in which the question of jurisdiction is involved;","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71232,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/71232","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/773a0de0a5b7d6447c64249ee826730c.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/773a0de0a5b7d6447c64249ee826730c.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/773a0de0a5b7d6447c64249ee826730c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/773a0de0a5b7d6447c64249ee826730c.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T16:05:11+00:00","modified":"2020-04-13T03:55:08+00:00","filename":"773a0de0a5b7d6447c64249ee826730c.jpg","authentication":"364dc9d7f93180f265f07c8eaf185afc","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL07_FL011_00008_o2 copy.jpg","size":807355,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2862,"compression_ratio":0.052239757227528},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["131131+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["131131+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["131131+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"773a0de0a5b7d6447c64249ee826730c.jpg","FileDateTime":1522425846,"FileSize":807355,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2862\"","Height":2862,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2862,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:15:44","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4804},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 13:11:31","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 13:11:31","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":69,"SubSecTimeOriginal":69,"SubSecTimeDigitized":69,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2862,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1057,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1057","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"involved; and the necessary papers have been prepared for taking them up by writs of error before the Supreme Court of the United States for a final decision.

But it would be folly in the extreme for the nation ever to think of conceding any of those rights, under existing circumstances;  - for unless we could be more permanently secured in the faithful protection of rights which are essential to the existence and well bring of the nation in our present location, - such concession would but weaken our cause and lead to our national extinction and individual destruction.\nAs to the policy of the United States' Government in the removal of the various Indian Tribes, west of the Mississippi, I am not disposed to call in question the feeling which first dictated it; and whilst I am willing to attach to it every thing that humanity and philanthropy can suggest in its favour, I may be permitted to express my fears as to the practical results and ultimate consequences of the measure. The emigrants cannot fail to experience the disaster & fatality which awaits them in their removal.

Consequently you will, As an act of justice to yourselves, as well as towards your country, take such suitable steps as you may deem prudent and proper, to counteract the foul aspersion cast upon your fellow citizens by those men; and to guard these citizens against the intriguing artifices of those who may be disposed to co-operate with them upon their return home, in forwarding the policy of the President for our national ruin. The Supreme Court in the case of Worcester &? Butler vs. the State of Georgia has determined the question of our national rights as fully as can be. The decision is final & cannot be revoked: but the course ? of legal proceedings is necessarily attended with tardiness, consequently should the authorities of Georgia, refuse, as they have done, to release immediately those much injured imprisoned gentlemen, and continue still to arrest & oppress our citizens, we should not be discouraged; - because the President, out of his disappointments, may still pursue a political course? towards us, under the hope that by withholding from us the protection of the government, a Treaty may yet be effected previous to the time when it shall become his imperious duty to act for the enforcement of this decision of the Supreme Court. The conflict is now between the United States & Georgia. The final issue ere long will be seen. Should Georgia prevail, the Union of the States is dissolved: but should the United States regard the constitutional liberties guaranteed to their citizens, Georgia must submit to see the Cherokees triumph over their oppressions under her usurped authority, therefore, let the people endure patiently to await the final result. We have gained a great point and they should be watchful over the conduct of such disappointed traitors as may be found amongst them. Thro' the false impressions made by them upon the Government, our sufferings have been prolonged, and protection withheld from us. Our country is again full of surveyors who are engaged by the authorities of Georgia, to run out a large portion of our Territory into small lots.

Whenever a majority were disposed to do so, that force would not be applied\" ?.

Walker & Starr & guard against any artifices? that may be used to divide & distract our people to this effect. We have therefore thought proper to send this circular into the different parts of the district, and that all our fellow citizens may have an opportunity of making known their feelings of expressing their attachment, to the government of our choice & the land of our fathers. These have been declared by the Supreme Court of the United States as belonging to us, as our proper rights. Those who put their names to this paper will do as much as to say, that they hold fast to the councel of their own chiefs; and seeing that no individuals have a right to make a Treaty, that right being rested in the lawful council of the nation, they are determined never to make, nor to attempt to make, a treaty respecting land, with any man or body of man; but continue to act, as they have ever acted, as loyal subjects of their own government. - May 8th, 1832.\nEwing?

It is known to you that WmH. Underwood Esq ? has been long in the service of the nation, and that he has been faithful in our cause; that he continues to be active & vigilant in pleading the law in support of the rights of our citizens; that for all his past services he has been paid but one Thousand Dollars & that through the hands of T. W. Harris who was at first associated with him and who has since treacherously deserted the cause which he had engaged to defend. The appropriations should be as liberal as the state of our treasury under existing circumstances, will allow. - Edward Hardin Esq has also rendered essential service, in concert with Underwood, in arguing the injunction cases before Judge Hooper at Cassville, for which he should also be remembered. It has also been communicated to me that several our citizens, previous to the argument of the injunction cases, deemed it adviseable to associate L. Rockwell Esq with our counsellors, & accordingly engaged his services & gave him their joint bond for the sum of one Thousand Dollars. It is now submitted for your consideration whether the nation ought not to assume the payment of this engagement. The great importance of the case, the elevated talents & professional ability of Col. Rockwell, together with the weight of character & influence which he commands among the citizens of his state, were considerations which induced our citizens to secure his services on the part of the nation. I have also been informed that Judge Underwood has associated in our cause Major Hansell? with himself. The valuable services of this Gentleman are fully known to some of you. His engagement, like that of Judge Underwood, is dependent entirely upon the liberality of the nation to compensate him whenever it may be in our power. - Barron & Irwin have also rendered important service in filling out blank injunctions & attending to such Cherokee cases as required their attention from time to time, during the absence of WmH. Underwood Esq; but of the particulars of their engagement I am not informed further than is stated in a letter received from them on the subject, which I submit for your perusal. - You will make such appropriations to meet these services as in your judgment the means of the Treasury will now justify.

Being fully convinced in their own judgment that they could not prosper as well any where else as upon their native land, the Cherokees have successively? appealed to the Executive, Legislative & Judiciary Departments of their Government for redress of wrongs committed and security against injuries apprehended, but as yet those appeals have been unavailing?\u00a0;

The reason why I have not written to you before now - I was in a low state of health & mind, together with my children.

I am at this time unable to do any work on account of just recovering from my spell of sickness.\nThe government has not made any payment to the Emigrants, and when they will make the payments to us, Jackson only knows. My friend, I can tell you , we emigrants have hard times - sick, and no money, nor friends. My friend Daniel, to do you justice & myself, I would say to you - never, never more towards the west, as long as you can find land to build your house on, in the east, of Mississippi. The Cherokee Government is going to rack. Since the death of Col: Webber, we are in the western wilds, like sheep without a shepherd. We have many afflictions to encounter with in the west, more than what we had in the east. To crown all, the dark shade of death is just at our door. We see our friends, neighbours and kin, dropping into grave yards. It is discouraging & distressing. Here I must stop on that subject.\nI have been told lately that Charles Rogers, J. Lo.?

We were all in great haste to see the agent, so as to get our rations; for, although we had the choice of getting money or rations, we were, from necessity, compelled to take corn & cattle; - and that, not as we pleased.- Most of the cattle that the emigrants got, were as wild and as unruly as the buffaloes in the western prairies from us. \nAnd as to the money arising from our improvements, it was only paid to us a few days since.

I saw a school at Dr M. Power's, to be supported by the money above mentioned. The school has been in operation three of four years. Not one dollar is paid as yet. The school has been carried on with borrowed money from the time the school has been in operation.\nAnd as to being out of the limits of the United States & Territories, I saw a letter from Gen: Arbuckle, commanding officer at cantonment Gibson, to Capt.

Such an arrangement could not fail in removing the seeds of contention","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71263,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/71263","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/6c31d130286cde6ee8e1c36ce92b3de4.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/6c31d130286cde6ee8e1c36ce92b3de4.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/6c31d130286cde6ee8e1c36ce92b3de4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6c31d130286cde6ee8e1c36ce92b3de4.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T16:05:40+00:00","modified":"2020-04-22T01:02:59+00:00","filename":"6c31d130286cde6ee8e1c36ce92b3de4.jpg","authentication":"56b30718bef094314a4e2b881c78390c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL07_FL011_00028_o2.jpg","size":756057,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2877,"compression_ratio":0.048665469431893},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["132129+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["132129+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["132129+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6c31d130286cde6ee8e1c36ce92b3de4.jpg","FileDateTime":1522425847,"FileSize":756057,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2877\"","Height":2877,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2877,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:15:59","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4700},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 13:21:29","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 13:21:29","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":42,"SubSecTimeOriginal":42,"SubSecTimeDigitized":42,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2877,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1057,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1057","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"contention, which have been sown in the ground of jurisdiction and thereby all causes which have ever been fruitful in creating irritating excitements, would be eradicated.

This you were before informed should be done, and the pledge will be redeemed with fidelity.

On proposing to cede to country for the removal of its aboriginal inhabitants, past experience has shown there is danger for civil discord, commotion and bloodshed. The violence of your opposition to all propositions hitherto submitted, - apart from the solemn engagement of yourself, Sam Gunter, Daniel McCoy , Richard Taylor and unclear Rodgers, to urge on your people the acceptance of such a gross sum as might be fixed upon by the Senate of the United States, would give rise to apprehensions that you and your council will endeavor to produce excitement and raise a prejudice against that patriotic band headed by John Ridge, who were instrumental in eliciting from the executive of the United States these liberal terms.

- and in communicating to them the proceedings of the late Delegation, it is indispensibly necessary that the propositions which were submitted for the consideration of the President and rejected by him, should be clearly understood: - by offering to make a concession of certain rights to the United States for the adjustment of our difficulties, that it has not been done from any binding obligation on our part, but only from the necessity of our situation and with the view of securing relief for our people; and that peace, harmony & good neighborhood with our white hethren might be preserved: - and that, by the rejection of those propositions on the part of the President, our rights have not been impaired, nor in the Cherokee people in the slightest manner committed or entramelled? by those propositions. Such being the true state of the case, the rights of the nation remain unimpaired, but those difficulties which have been unjustly brought upon us are still continued.

The gentlemen appointed to take the census, state, that communications have been sent by you to different parts of the nation, commanding your people not to give up their names & number to the persons who may call on them for that purpose; and that in consequence of this, many of the people have utterly refused to give the requisite information to them.\nThis is much to be regretted, as we are persuaded that the object of the government in taking the census is to enable it to deal in the most fair and just manner with the Cherokee Nation. There has been heretofore complaint made to the Government that the annuity of the Nation was not equally divided between the Eastern and Western Cherokees; and the president, with a view of doing equal justice to both parts of the Nation, directed as we understand, the census to be taken. There is another reason for taking the census at this time. The Commissioners in their instructions are required to obtain the consent of a majority of your head men & warriors to a treaty, to make it valid; and for this purpose it is necessary to have an accurate census of the nation taken now. We hope, therefore, that instead of opposing the officers of the government in this matter, you will render them every facility in your power to execute the business assigned them correctly & fairly; by appointing such of your principal men, to accompany them, as you may think proper. Should you, however, take a different course, we cannot be responsible for the consequences of resisting the constituted authorities of the Government of the United States. \nWith great respect Your ob servts\nWm Carroll\nJ.F.

He expressed a desire to have an opportunity of seeing the most influential & leading men of the nation, that he might converse with them. I stated to him that in case Major Currey could be prevailed upon to change the place he had designated for the election, so as to hold it either at Red Clay or at the Agency, that I would endeavor to gratify his wishes, by inviting them to attend; but, as you will perceive from the documents submitted, this reasonable request was not complied with; and it then became my duty to request the general attendance of the people at the place designated by Major Currey, inasmuch as the Department of War having given instructions that the money should be paid over agreably to the votes of the majority of the persons attending.- Of the votes given in, there were 2225 for paying

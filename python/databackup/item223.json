Luey and Mary Moody Luey. The third of five children, she lived with her family in Greenfield until she married Charles P. Parish on December 27, 1881. Charles Parish\u2019s family was from Omaha, Nebraska, but Charles and Flora, his sister, grew up in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Flora married Sam Tobin; one of their children, Kittie, married Frank Lloyd Wright.<br \/><br \/>Charles and Martha Parish settled in Chicago, Illinois, where they raised five children. Charles co-owned a cabinet hardware and upholstery goods manufacturing company in Chicago called Gibson, Parish &amp; Company. For a number of years the family lived in a house on Kimbark Avenue in Chicago, living next door to cousins on the Parish side of the family. They later bought and moved to a farm in Homewood, Illinois. Martha Luey Parish died on June 8, 1925.<br \/><br \/>Most of the letters are from Martha Ellen Luey Parish to her father, Lester Lyman Luey. The letters mainly concern domestic matters, although some community topics are touched on. Among the subjects are electrification, the bicycling mania, fires and fire insurance, the final days of the Columbian Exposition, weather, and health matters. There are also several letters concerning the problems created by Martha\u2019s alcoholic brother Henry Luey, who was finally placed at the \"Washington Home\" to recover. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.newberry.org\/collections\/FindingAids\/parish\/Parish.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<\/a>","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":41,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/41","name":"Description","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Parish family letters, 1884-1896","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":50,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/50","name":"Title","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Electrification, the bicycling mania of the late 19th century, fires and fire insurance, the remains of the World's Columbian Exposition, and an alcoholic brother.","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":46,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/46","name":"Relation","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"100","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":55,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/55","name":"Percent Completed","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"100100","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":56,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/56","name":"Weight","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}

We made camp on one of these streams at about 3 oclock P.M. and were pestered almost to death by the myriad of crickets upon the surface of the ground all over this portion of the valley. The crickets were large black fellows an inch and a half in length by a half inch in diameter. They covered the ground in the evening two or three deep so that we found it impossible to make down our blankets without crushing them by hundreds. They eat holes in our blankets, eat up our sacks and our clothes did not escape.

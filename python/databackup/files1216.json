You don't know how lonesome and deserted we look and feel here. But, Mother, how very thoughtful you was to take the pair of spectacles you use most! Was'nt I vexed with myself when I found you had left one pair here? When you particularly desired me to remind you of them? And Joseph's meal - that was worse than all the rest. He'll have nothing to make bread of. I have put them all together in the firkin, as also the French Grammar - which I suppose he intended to take, - and his gun, which of course he will mourn after, if I do not send it! Guess I won't write any more now. Four o'clock P.M. What a long still day this has been! two hours more before Johnny will make his appearance. I have got a tremendous cold - head ache am so hoarse I can scarcely speak loud. My throat is exceeding sore - haven't got a yarb of any kind in the house. Though I must do something, so I fixed some Flax seed and loaf sugar -guess I'll soak mt feet tonight and be well in the morning. I fear you and Josie have both been cold today, it has been so windy, but I suppose you are safe home by this time, unless Josie had to stop to rest. Wish I could spend the evening with you all at home. I wish I had something more to write but believe I have not, so will put away my paper.

What a stormy day! real driving snow storm this forenoon, and fast rain this afternoon. Samuel read \"Lyell\" to me and fixed his boots, while I mended his coat. This P.M. he is writing to Warren while I scribble to you. I forgot to put your Inkstand in the firkin. Josie, having company, you know, and much else to think of; so I got it ready to send up \"Pa,\" but he could not take it. Samuel says we had better get a good bottle & carry up when we go. I have never seen but three or four of the numerous inkstands you mentioned and most of those I gave to Mr. Crosby's children. There is only one here now. I wrote a little to send by Mr. Furber, but thought it not worth the trouble. Mrs. Crosby is getting better slowly. I wish to know the precise quantity of cord wanted for the Pall Cloth, from tassels I believe - write me, and I will try to get it before I go to Milo . Isaac's things are all ready. Kerchief hemmed and all. What a pity Charles did not bring his hog down sooner, when there was better sleighing and a higher price - butter too has fallen is being brought in in immense quantities, 'tis said. \n                Last night Jane was looking out the window and said there was a great star bigger than all the rest, and had longer prickers too. How I want to see you all, and Charlie too, he must cut a fine figure sawing wood. Mrs. Furber left me a skein of white yarn, so I shall not need any more Mother. Yesterday and last night had bad head and ague ache - took a little more cold I suppose. Soaked my feet and sweated, - fell better today than I have before since you went away.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94706,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94706","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b0e33222e0f47635926c20da01fb2c2f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b0e33222e0f47635926c20da01fb2c2f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b0e33222e0f47635926c20da01fb2c2f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b0e33222e0f47635926c20da01fb2c2f.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:47:25+00:00","modified":"2020-07-04T17:45:29+00:00","filename":"b0e33222e0f47635926c20da01fb2c2f.jpg","authentication":"e607c56d2b52ee3b0c0d6274e592e83c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_23_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1376764,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2820,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.045205017073811},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["041751"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["041751"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["041751"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b0e33222e0f47635926c20da01fb2c2f.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652425,"FileSize":1376764,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2820\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2820,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 16:39:34","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:31 04:17:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:31 04:17:51","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"SubSecTimeOriginal":77,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2798,"ExifImageLength":3571,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"March 14th, Thought I would not tear off the former part this epistle, valueless though it be, but \"continue to proceed on.\" We arrived safely & comfortably home Sat.

Prof. Shepard, on Paul's talking to Felix & Drusilla. Stormy in afternoon - went not. Monday did big washing most three weeks. Tuesday baked pies, & in the midst of it came Eliab with a sleigh load of girls.

Louise said she could block out a cap for me cheaper than she could sell lace in the piece for one, as they use all the time cutting out. Quilted lace 12 1\/2 a piece - got a piece and 1\/2, put two rows in front, one behind, don't know as I got a good ribbon enough for strings, but thought you did not want very nice. The man did not throw in any silk with the drops, - naughty, ought to.

He came and introduced himself to Samuel, who was chopping wood at the door; \"believed he was Mr. Metcalf's partner in business\" etc. Samuel invited him in - he stopped two hours or so, took dinner, & rode up to Bangor with Samuel. He talked most all the time about Religion, querying about one thing and another etc. He does act very queer. Samuel hardly knew what to make of him. Eliab says he owes him $2.50 and would owe him much more if he would have lent it to him. Yesterday I did \"break the ice\" and go to Sewing Circle at William Bennett's. Enjoyed it very well. Mrs. Jewett pleasant & polite as usual. Hannah Moore \"chock full\" of \"carrying on\" about Mr. Webb & Mr. Dunmore & much jabber about cholera & everything else most. Dysentery with cramps very prevalent now. Dr. Rich says no doubt Cholera will be here again. Third Parish have held divers meetings & have given Mr. Webb a call. Offer him $850, with the privilege of being absent half the time for two years, at ten dollars per sabbath. The Augusta people previously offered 800, only, but would at any rate overbid Bangor if that would make any difference, which Webb says it would not.

Bell wants to read them very much, but Lis has gone to Portland to spend vacation & marry Mary Shirley (bridesmaid) and I can't get there now. Catechism, cord & tassel shall be duly attended to. I must go bake - Samuel will finish. In love and haste. Lucy. The big beautiful Cactus is all dead, but Samuel bought of Brockmiller two more - one two years old with four buds, said to be handsomer than the old one - and one a year old - no buds.\nWe desire you if you please to send us a box of your nice new butter forthwith. Letter from Ann recently. Samuel will buy a cow soon - make no butter - sell milk to the branding house. Please send the butter by carts soon as convenient, to be left at his stopping places. Wish you could also send a Monk's hood Lily, Flax & roots at the same time. I have not been to sewing circle for two or three weeks - stormy &c. Mrs. Jewett has been quite sick - well now - Charles Jenkins better - believe I wrote you that he had several attacks of hemmorage, which reduced him very much and much and much alarmed his friends. Jane has got a new Atlas & gets along nicely with her lessons. Has got through the Catechism. Mrs. Goddard's little babe weighed 4 1\/2 pounds, had fits all the time & died in two or three days - she cried I cried a great deal. I have got some acquainted with her.

We had a fine time coming down, only sorry we did not bring Lute. Stopped two hours at Bradford, most of which time I slept refreshingly on the hard narrow sofa. We were just in time for the stage dinner. Samuel went to the table. I did not - he brought me ham & potatoes, bread, & butter, strawberry and custard pie. I did not feel as well that day as for some previous days - was very tired at night, slept almost all day Sunday, feel quite nicely today. We got here some after five. Jane came with a fine lot of strawberries soon after, and who do you guess next? Charles Harlow, of course! Very glad to see us -very sociable etc. for half an hour or so, then wished to speak alone with Samuel, wanted to borrow five dollars and give good security! He would probably have got it if I had not previously heard of Eliab's trials. I pitied the fellow - to walk away down here to ask such a favor of an almost entire stranger, and be refused too! Albina's bread was good - and quite a blessing to us. I hope you'll think to send my green veil by Lucy. I forgot it. Mrs. Goddard is very sick again with her breast - worse than ever. They feared she would have fits yesterday. I expected it when she came up here that damp morning. I forgot to talk all I intended with Almeda about her bonnet. If I were in her place I would have a black straw, lined with black, if she prefers it to white, trimmed with crepe or ribbon just as she likes, and a plain black lace veil with broad hem - all of which would be very cheap and proper.

I try to help her, but she thinks I can't very well. Mrs. Goddard's sister is fitting her dress today. I am desirous to get it done for her to wear next sabbath, as he other one is somewhat soiled. If Almeda has a fine white skirt which she can send as well as not, perhaps she had better, to wear under her muslin. Am having it cut high outside, lining loose with adging round the tip. Almeda must it think I am extravagant - the child certainly needed another dress here. She & Mr. Temple seemed as pleased to see each other as our brother & sister. He seems to feel very much for the Milo people. I have made Lucy a small plaid, blue gingham apron, looks real pretty. I was much disappointed not to hear Mr. Little's Eulogy on the President today, but it rained. Samuel has engaged with Mr. Hathorne the same as last year. Is at Old Town lots lately, and expects to be more next week. Sat. P.M. Lucy's dress is all done. -sets beautifully. The poor girl has pretty hard work writing letters - she has been so unused to excitement that the company got her all into fidgets the other day.

Some little scribblings to Eliab or Josie's business etc. and a little meagre note from Almeda, mostly to Lucy - no more for a long, long time, when I want so much to hear of every thing. No letter from Isaac yet, either. We learned from John, who came Teusday that Alfred said Joseph was certainly better - stood alone in the floor for a minute.\n Samuel is busy as busy can be in the mill, up to Old Town etc. Bennett was so little respected and consequently so much imposed upon by the mill men, that Hathorne got out of patience and turned him out of the synagogue this week - our friend Abel Hardy takes charge now. The day before Bennett left as he was passing under the step, some one poured a pail of cold water directly on him - wet his best hat and \"go to snutins'\" sadly. That is only one of many things that were constantly taking place. Day before yesterday Lucy and I spent the afternoon at Mrs. Crosby's. I have made seven tumblers of currant jelly - real nice - and Jane is picking the Gooseberries to preserve today. I have made Lucy's dress - she has worn it to meeting two sabbaths - my new one, and had my pink muslin and pretty blue calico made over in fashion - also made Jane's","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94741,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94741","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/2b4a9d4323a52156ba604b8f7e48d087.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/2b4a9d4323a52156ba604b8f7e48d087.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/2b4a9d4323a52156ba604b8f7e48d087.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2b4a9d4323a52156ba604b8f7e48d087.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:48:11+00:00","modified":"2020-05-25T04:12:02+00:00","filename":"2b4a9d4323a52156ba604b8f7e48d087.jpg","authentication":"a269f9d45871ced1e14ef7a383f49df1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_23_013_002_o2.jpg","size":1416397,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2775,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04726049382716},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["042158"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["042158"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["042158"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"2b4a9d4323a52156ba604b8f7e48d087.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652427,"FileSize":1416397,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2775\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2775,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 16:40:41","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:31 04:21:58","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:31 04:21:58","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2774,"ExifImageLength":3598,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"light calico that her Mother sent her - her \"bonnet with reafs,\" you know.

People at home\n\n                                  I went shopping yesterday! Purchased the one pr of hose in payment of 25 cents, which was all I could get. The other two for Eliab has to give to Mr. Temple, who is yet in Bangor. Mr. Kimball as left - what shall be done with the towel? I also got ten yds of the above mentioned sheeting for Almeda and five for Albina (just enough for a pair of chemise, and very pretty for it too I think.) should think it would be pretty also for children's nightgowns when bleached. You will find this kind all in one piece - 25 yds. For Albina five yds \/ 4 per yd     .32\n               11 3\/4 yds, 4 cents \" .47\n               11 \"            9 cents ___99\n               3\/4 \" linen, 50 per yd  37 1\/2\n                1 brown table cover       75\n                1 salt cellar                    10\n                                                  $3.00\n\nI could not find any 8 cent sheeting very good. Thought this 9 cent was nice. I put in a bit like what I was making at home for Samuel - you will see it is a min. quality. Thought eleven yds would make Charles two prs of shirts. For Josie's shirts I got 6 yds of the same kind. Ten yds of ,6 1\/4 and a 1\/2 of, 4 for Almeda makes just a dollar, besides which, from her funds I paid the remaining , 30 besides what the stockings pd for the S. Circle. This is a jumbled up mess - don't know as you will understand it.

I got my washing all out on the line before tea today. Why, I wonder did not Mrs. Lee stop here? Tell her I don't mean to go see her anymore, if she will go right by me without stopping. Perhaps she don't want me to. Samuel & I attended Musical Convention Concerts two evenings - he could not leave in the day time. One eve paid.50 - the other, John being a member of the Association, got us free tickets - real good -sung one piece forty seven pages long, in the Dulcimer. \"Oratorio of Absolom.\" I'll send a Programme if I can. Dulcimer is a new book - some of I.N.

Felt rather foolish after washing & all the evening - and Tuesday morning got up with headache, pain in back and limbs, & for that matter all over, jumping pulse, and dysentery to boot - groaned all night with pain in back and limbs like aching fingers where my cold - been lolling on the sofa about half dressed ever since - slept tolerably last night though I feel better today. Is there such a Thing as inflamation of the Diaphragm?  I have had much severe pain & sounds right across the pit of my stomach - hurt me to cough terribly and to move \"every which way.\" Samuel has made bread two or three times - capital too - and Jane done all the rest of the week, like a woman - every thing in the world she could do for me. & took care nicely. She is a jewell - has earned cents enough rising at 5 in the morning to get some cunning little presents for Lucy & James, little german silver thimble for Lissie, A.B.C. card for Charlie, besides a shawl pin for Albina, which will be forwarded when Ann goes. If you read serpent for superb this time you must remember that I write in my Cap, head aching.

Dec. 3.rd 1850\n\nTo the dear ones at home - \n\n                                    On this bright & beautiful morning sitting here in my chair, I am permitted to write a little in short - Mr. Micawber, ahem. Well, I will being about I as usual. I am getting along nicely now - gaining strength daily, only I cannot walk. Samuel has carried me out to my meals three days - went out to breakfast this morning - also he carried me out on the piazza Sat. and yesterday, and held me there about five minutes each time - all I have been out of doors yet  - no more Irritable weather. I was poked? into the sitting room yesterday while Ann opened the window & gave my room & bed an airing. Yesterday I knitted almost an inch - first time I have had any work at all - feel enough better today to pay for it - expect to get well surprisingly now! Jane was quite unwell a day or two after Almeda went home - took some oil & is very well now - made it hard for Ann to have us both to wait upon some, and the work to do besides. Her back is weak & troubles her, but I think if Jane is well, she will get along easier in future. Jane has been so turned about for a few weeks, that she is hardly herself, but will come round again soon I think. Almeda did not seem well at all for two or three days before she went home. I am afraid she worked too hard & got too tired here. I suppose I must not write any more now. Be kissed & loved, all of you, for me. Do write to us - good bye - Lucy.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94771,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94771","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/4aae5acc31d060fb9f733b571434c023.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/4aae5acc31d060fb9f733b571434c023.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/4aae5acc31d060fb9f733b571434c023.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4aae5acc31d060fb9f733b571434c023.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:48:51+00:00","modified":"2020-05-27T03:08:21+00:00","filename":"4aae5acc31d060fb9f733b571434c023.jpg","authentication":"9523058c25851ba4de7f0e9487a775bd","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_23_023_002_o2.jpg","size":1056683,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2815,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.034757022564305},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["042622"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["042622"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["042622"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4aae5acc31d060fb9f733b571434c023.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652429,"FileSize":1056683,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2815\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2815,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 16:41:40","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:31 04:26:22","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:31 04:26:22","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2808,"ExifImageLength":3591,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Much obliged to Almeda for being so thoughtful & prompt about the liniment -

They have a great muss at the mill & boarding house needed? them - men want him to come back - Hathorne does too, but won't pay much. I tell him 'tis a good thing that he is out of business now, but he feels rather uneasy sometimes. I think he & Isaac had better lay their heads together and set up something. I want to see Joseph or have you write more particularly.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94778,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94778","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/619928a09eef5198db9a23553a694727.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/619928a09eef5198db9a23553a694727.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/619928a09eef5198db9a23553a694727.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/619928a09eef5198db9a23553a694727.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:49:00+00:00","modified":"2020-05-27T19:41:19+00:00","filename":"619928a09eef5198db9a23553a694727.jpg","authentication":"b5bc99b3c41e2d2c3f2f83302c5f97a2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_23_025_003_o2.jpg","size":1116937,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2764,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.037416820764324},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["042707"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["042707"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["042707"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"619928a09eef5198db9a23553a694727.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652429,"FileSize":1116937,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2764\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2764,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 16:41:53","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:31 04:27:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:31 04:27:07","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"SubSecTimeOriginal":89,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2781,"ExifImageLength":3622,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"[particularly] about him, whether he is going backwards or forwards or both.

Mine continues to trouble me slightly by spells - today it burns & almost smarts, and I notice the skin is all peeling off over the whole part. Sam'l has subscribed for the Independent. I have read Hist. of Josephine and we are reading \"Great Cities by Todd author of Students Manual.\" Very good indeed.

We shall expect to see Jamie or somebody else down with the Vine the last of this week. Samuel thinks he shall get a little pig, and put all the milk and cream which we cannot use, together with a sufficient quantity of meal, into the same, as with our change for making butter, and an inexperienced housemaid, it would be of little use to try to make butter. Our neighbors, many of them have cows, so there is little chance to sell milk. Isaac went from here in the Waterville stage at 4 o'clock this evening bought him a very pretty hat and vest yesterday.

Samuel does not feel so well this morning - he dipped himself in the salt water & got chilly before he got back to the house. He seems a little feverish, & did last night. If he is not gaining, we shall come next Monday. If we are ever so sick, we cannot get away before then. However, there is a Dr. here. Samuel has laid down & feels better - don't worry a bit about us. Mrs. Webb is so kind & good as can be.

She is shopping all the time - getting all sorts of nice things. She popped in quite unexpectedly last Tuesday. Mother had gone to Mrs. Brown's to dinner, by special invitation, to meet Mrs. Lee. Mr. and Mrs. Lee came home with her and spent the night. I was invited to Mrs. Brown's too, but would'nt go because Samuel was not asked!\n  Samuel is getting along nicely now - his appetite is good and he gains strength finely since he has done sweating nights. We only staid at Deer Isle five days. Samuel went to the salt water, got chilly, and brought his fever again so we had to have the doctor four or five times. So we thought best to get home just as soon as he felt able to come. I think the sea air & bathing would have benefited me if we had staid longer & I had not been so tired and anxious about him all the time. Went Wednes. & back the next Mond. Cost us $15.00 Yesterday afternoon we all went to Hampden & Mrs. Crosby's.

Lucy's old sac & mine, when we have done wearing then will help along. I am very glad you have fixed her sack. You did not write whether Almeda was going to fix her cloak. What did you trim Lucy's with? What is Lissy going to have? I think you had better send us a firkin of butter, and let me keep the firkin this winter if you have one to spare. We use a good deal of butter now, more than when we have plenty of milk, you know. Weigh out a firkin full of lumps & send by first opportunity. It is cool weather now, so it will keep - tell how much there is, and the price.\n\n                        As for your coming here - I certainly don't wish you to spend the winter here, if you would better enjoy being there. As for my being at Milo, I think it is entirely out of the question. It is not worth while to break up unless there is a necessity for it. If I continue to gain as for a week or two past, I think you & I & Jane can get along very comfortably by hiring, washings, and you know you can bring & do any kind of work here if you wish. I want you should do just as you like. If you think you had rather stay there, try to engage Alice for me. We should all like it so much better not to have any body but our folks. I may be able to do the washing and hard work myself before winter is out! I am so smart. Eliab as not brought Susan nor said any thing about getting board for her.

He want to see Mr. One, and unless he gets a letter from him today, may go. Eliab had a letter from Ann yesterday. No news except that Argyle P. Rumsey took Bliss (The name of his wife) to himself very unexpectedly to see his friends a few days since. She gives Eliab lots of good advice about \"Susan\" etc.etc. I have had a \"pull back\" for a few days - feel better today. I cannot imagine the cause, but my back gave out all at once. It was as much as I could well do to get across the room.\n   Frances says she wants to go home before Thanksgiving, which you know, is the 27 - of this month. So please to hasten your decision that I may not be left without any help. Eliab thinks that unless he makes a trade with Brown to go back there, he shall go west very soon. Then, if expedient, we can turn \"Tib\" away, so as to have a small family.

Mr. Tebbits is over at work on the \"Pendle-pant's\" house.\n                       Three good surveyors are \"out of the market\" - (one gone to selling rum - the only licensed rumseller in Bangor) one moved to Boston, and one sick, so there is a great demand for surveyors, now just as the river is shutting up, and everybody is in a hurry to get their lumber surveyed and the vessels sent off. Divers people are after Samuel. The surveyor general is very anxious for Samuel to take hold and help this fall, but won't give him a commission for another year. I tell him I would'nt do a thing now in the coldest most uncomfortable part of the whole season, unless he would let one survey next year.

Please specify how much calico you want, and I will get the rest in Crash? . I am glad your bonnet suits so well. Perhaps Stephen told you how Samuel lost the Messengers - he went to Curen's to try and replace them, but could not, so you will all have to go without the March Numbers - we are very sorry. The April numbers are here, ready, waiting for an opportunity to send them. If you would just ask Mr. Smith to call when he is down - it would be both a pleasure to us to see him, and a convenience to send by him. Lucy seems to get along well and like her school. Mr. Littlefield was not ejected, so she goes to Miss Call - James was more than qualified for the Grammar school in every thing else, but could not get along with ciphering","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94821,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94821","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/317a85088133304d2c2ea9b98e54a56d.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/317a85088133304d2c2ea9b98e54a56d.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/317a85088133304d2c2ea9b98e54a56d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/317a85088133304d2c2ea9b98e54a56d.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:49:59+00:00","modified":"2020-05-29T18:10:43+00:00","filename":"317a85088133304d2c2ea9b98e54a56d.jpg","authentication":"bb0a50c3a6fc038402d2c7e168b4c286","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_25_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1462019,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2890,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046841567345893},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001859"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001859"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001859"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"317a85088133304d2c2ea9b98e54a56d.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652431,"FileSize":1462019,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2890\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2890,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 09:55:27","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:01 00:18:59","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:01 00:18:59","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"SubSecTimeOriginal":12,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2939,"ExifImageLength":3661,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"quite fast enough, so I have her wait another time.

Well, we passed a quiet day yesterday, after our usual fashion - about tea time who should appear to us but Rev. Mr. Partridge, his wife and baby, to stay all night. They had been to tea. We received them graciously. Lucy and Jane trimmed round like women, prepared the \"go to meetin' chamber,\" got things ready for breakfast etc. We had baked veal for dinner yesterday and some slices cold for breakfast with warm potatoes, bread & butter, & doughnuts, all ready by 1\/2 past sic this morning. They went out in the Boston at 11 this A.M. Samuel gave Mrs. P. $5.00 as a parting present! I guess they feel poor.\n\nP.M. Well, yesterday afternoon Lucy ironed all but the starched clothes. Those I have done this forenoon. So our ironing for the week is done.

Yesterday I cut her hair all off close, & had her scruff thoroughly in hot soap suds - and today have combed and completely saturated her hair with grease. The term is but three weeks longer. I hardly know whether to have her finish or not. She has not learned near so much as she would have done at home.

It is unusually difficult to obtain mittens here this winter, and you know we can never buy good yarn. Don't trouble anything about it  of not convenient. About beef, butter & chickens, if Charles is coming down, I should think he had better bring what butter & chickens he has to spare as he would probably get more for them here. We bought a firkin of butter recently, very ? in stamped lumps (50 pounds) but shall probably want some more. We have also bought a quarter of beef - wish we had not, so I think likely yours is better, though this is good - a far cow four years old. Apples I judge are pretty cheap everywhere this year.

She sent her bonnet to be colored & trimmed, and wished a veil procured also. Eliab came home last friday - made no purchases - Maria was dear good while he was gone - came almost every day; sewed some, altering a dress for me, and relieved me almost entirely of the care of baby, and for that matter Mrs. Griffith too - she kept him all the time - fed him with checkerberry, catnip and what not. She understand the matter of taking care of babies admirably I assure you. The little Percie is very good most of the time - has a worrying day once in awhile, as yesterday for instance, but is just as good as babies can be today to pay for it. I have not fed him a bit for a number of days, except occasionally a little elder blows or checkerberry for medicine. The elder flower answer nicely for physic. Mrs. Lee said they were good, so I deem it no harm to use them, although she alone of all the many I have consulted in regard to \"sugar rags\" agrees with Mrs. Page - O, yes,\n\n[left-hand side]I thought you were going to stay at Almeda's with Anna, so as to fix that delaine dress right off.

Please write by first mail your conclusions. Theodore & Sarah will undoubtedly be here this week and we do not like to be away when they come. If we go before they come Samuel would want to go again, which would be inconvenient. Isn't it singular about the school house? Lissie says there is a Jonah. We rode up to see her last night - she says she don't know anything what to think, but once in a while bursts into a hearty laugh. I think she feels a good deal & laughs to keep from crying! She thinks it best by all means to go, according to Mr. Carpenter's invitation.

Or do you think better to write to Miss Bright before you decided upon anything & see what opening there is with her.

Percie is asleep and I must improve my opportunity. He has been pretty goodnatured, but until yesterday has seemed very much stuffed with phelgm, and hoarse by spells, so that I have not dared to put him down. Sabbath day we put a bandage on his neck & gave him some of his medicine, fearing the croup. I think if I am careful now he will get entirely over it. You say I am too careful, but just as sure as I try to be careless a bit, he takes cold. He had grown poor. The cow came lat night. I hope he will thrive on good new milk. Though for several days he has not taken any  - won't swallow a bit of any kind of food, but is very tenacious of titty! The cow gives a nice mess of milk. Mr. Jordan will take the mornings' milk every day and allow five cents a quart, which is better than we expected to do with it. He has taken back the little cans too. I wish you would send the milk quart next time Samuel comes. The eggs were very acceptable, but Isabel put them in with the others before I had counted them. I had a nice long letter of four pages from Charles\n\n[left-hand side and top] going will give some offence; but if we begin where can we end?

We some expect Mrs. Crosby to spend a day with us this week. We are at quite a loss to know what to do about inviting Mr. Harlow's family here now that you have left.

There is an aching void, and how shall it be filled? I was quite amused with Eliab, as we sat down to tea after he and Samuel came on Saturday, why, where is Mother? he said, without once thinking that he was the very one who carried you away from us. We are still hoping that you will come soon and finish out the visit you had only commenced. Do you think I need feel under any obligation to attend dancing parties?

Don't let James and Jane trouble you. I am grieved about them both. I think Sam'l had better make every effort to find a place for Jane. I had a letter from Ann a few days since which I will enclose, also a few envelopes enough to last till Samuel goes up again, when I will send more. Eliab got them for you. We expected Mrs. Palmer to spend the day yesterday, but instead, Mr. & Mrs. Crosby came to dine and Julia Parker to spend the afternoon, all unexpectedly - Julia is a very pleasant girl - good, rather loquacious like her Mother, but the good sense of her father to go with her loquacity. Don't we enjoy our cow?

I have been unusually hurried (and that is saying a good deal, you know) for a few days, as Samuel bought a whole pig, which gave me some work to do, and as Isabel was going with Samuel, I wanted to get done last week Then Friday Lizzie Thaxter came to spend the day - her husband to tea: besides my usual work & baby - Percie is somewhat troublesome, crying for me nowadays. If I leave the room a moment, he is almost sure to cry; I carry him with me frequently because he will cry if I leave him. He is getting to feed nicely now - that is, he drinks new milk twice a day, and nibbles a crust of bread occasionally. He would eat a good deal if we carried him to the table.

The Tebbetts house cannot be had, much to Eliab's and Mallie's disappointment, and they cannot go back to Mr. Palmer's to board. There is no suitable home either for rent or for sale, and they can find no other boarding place, so of course they must stay here, and we must all accommodate ourselves to circumstances and do the best we can. Property of all kinds is going up at a rapid rate: rents, house lots and houses are increasing in value. That is, prices are raised, every day. Well, they will be here probably all through whatever may take place, summer and fall. I am really very poorly. The complaint has never troubled me so much before. I was weak, and had the injury to my back along with it before, but this has never been so bad; it never troubled me nights before. Now I feel the pain and weakness when in bed, as if I could not get up again. I do walk into the bedroom and kitchen because I cannot help it, and of course have to lift and take care of Percie more or less as best I can, but I am so afraid I shall get fairly down on my back, I don't know what to do. I feel debilitated & strengthless, and must have somebody to relieve me from the care of Percie immediately. I thought when they expected to go away so soon, I would try to worry along till they left and then Isabel could\n\n[left-hand side] ness and ever so much further.

Her work will not be hard & I should think her wages ought to be light. I send for Dr. Paine the day before yesterday. He left me medicine which he thought would relieve me, but says care is the chief thing. Says I must not lift baby. I told him I could'nt help it. He said I must wean him immediately, as nursing aggravated the trouble, so I began yesterday. We get along pretty well with him. Mallie and Isabel get him to sleep. I think the breast-pipe which I have to use aggravates more than nursing, but I suppose I shall not have to use it many days. I am going to send for Mrs. Harlow to come in and tell me how to manage by and by. I have written a long and dolorous story about I, but I know you would want to know just how we are. In truth, I never felt so lowpogy before. I had been so well & taken so much comfort in being so, & had anticipated so much in being able to go out in the garden & round with baby this summer it almost seems as if I could'nt bear it. But perhaps when he is fairly weaned and the spring weather has gone, I shall feel better. Sam'l has concluded not to sell the horse. He and Eliab together will keep him, so we shall have more rides. Mallie is quite smart & well - walked to meeting & back last sabbath, and yesterday down to Mrs. Palmer's\n[left-hand side] I expect the carpenters will begin on the bedroom next week.

Things have managed queerly about my getting anybody to help me, and we finally concluded that it was not right to have any more help! So Maria has taken a good deal of care of baby and we have got along without. In the first place we sent for Mrs. Bates, a regular nurse, but she had just engaged herself elsewhere, then for a good little scotch girl of Mr. Harlow's recommending, who could not come then, next for a girl we heard of through Mr. Pages' people whose grandmother said she might come, but who never made her appearance; next for M.Richer, but just as we had dispatched the Letter, Lizzie Doe heard of our necessities and felt so distressed that the chance was lost for her orphan niece, that I forthwith sent another letter countermanding orders, as you know. Next day instead of her coming here to stay as I expected, she came with a note from Lizzie, saying that her mother was not well and wanted the granddaughter. She was extremely sorry and said that she might stay with me notwithstanding","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94987,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94987","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/4441e398b5939280e18a4d9efe72346d.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/4441e398b5939280e18a4d9efe72346d.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/4441e398b5939280e18a4d9efe72346d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4441e398b5939280e18a4d9efe72346d.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:02:02+00:00","modified":"2020-06-06T04:16:56+00:00","filename":"4441e398b5939280e18a4d9efe72346d.jpg","authentication":"2c019e959bddf04df875d1e4fcad60a7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_26_028_002_o2.jpg","size":1337010,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2818,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.043930880845359},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["004118"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["004118"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["004118"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4441e398b5939280e18a4d9efe72346d.jpg","FileDateTime":1586653299,"FileSize":1337010,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2818\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2818,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 10:01:12","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:01 00:41:18","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:01 00:41:18","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":44,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2869,"ExifImageLength":3665,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"if I said so, or at least till I could write again for the Milo girl, but we had had so much fuss that Maria said she has rather take still more care of Percie for a while than to have any body come.

If you or Almeda have any we would like a small box as soon as it can be sent by stage. I shall write to Almeda about it. Butter is very high and it is almost impossible to get any good here now. I shall write to Almeda too, and if she and Albina both send a box, it will not come amiss. If there is more than we want, it can go right into the store. Samuel and Eliab have got a splendid store. The largest and best arranged store, wharf and counting room in the city. Their counting room in particular is very pleasant. Very high, with large windows coming almost to the floor on three sides, a large, handsome and convenient desk, clock, looking glass, table of books, papers etc. They will have to negotiate some, as Sam'l says in order to meet their notes, for a while, but think it is a good business, and an excellent situation, and that they can carry it through safely.

I have to give him a good deal of cracked wheat and molasses to keep his bowels in order, and I am a little suspicious that the wheat is too coarse fodder for such a little chicken. Do you know? If Maria comes I do not want to engage her for any time, as perhaps I shall only want her a few weeks, & perhaps I may want to train her in and keep her to take Isabel's place when she goes away. I don't know when that will be. She is a Farris, and make it manifest once in a while.

Isabel went away Thursday. I have another girl engaged to come next day, but on engaging found her character was not good and have been without, except while Katy McLaughlin, who helps nicely about the care of Baby. But we are in a bad fix and must have help. Percie had a touch of croup the night after Isabel went away, so that had added to the care. He took cold when Katy had him out. I expected a girl today, (Irish) but she has not come.\n                         We think now of doing without till we go to Milo ad trying to hunt up one there or at Brownville. Nettie and I have some idea of going up before Anna comes, as I cannot go there; (there will be fatigue & excitement enough without) perhaps last of this week or first of next, if  Samuel cam leave to go with us. I think you may expect us. Mallie and Eliab will keep house. How does Almeda's lounge prosper? I will tell you about Isabel when I come.

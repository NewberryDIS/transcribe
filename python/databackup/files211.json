I had been \nwondering how you were getting along. I was surprised to hear \nby Sarah that you were still in Pittsburg, and could not but \nfeel that you might have remained here a little longer \nif you had wanted to and then I thought again if you did not \nwant to I did not either. Sarah was very glad to see you \nbut felt hurt & disappointed at the coldness & formality \nof a fashionable call, so unlike what she thought was your \ndisposition. She thought you highly dressed, rather dandyfied \nbut upon the whole she rather liked to see too much dress than \ntoo little, not so with me. I always think the style of \ndress indicative of the mind. Great minds cannot \nstoop or take time to decide upon the color of their Kids? or \nthe tie of their cravats. I insisted on it that any formality \nor stiffness you might assume was only on outside, \nbut my dear boy don't let the world get the ascendency \nover your feelings and affections, be yourself always. \nCherish and indulge your noblest nature, the affections, \nand despise the vain and heartless requirements of the world. \nSarah was not alone in thinking you greatly changed by contact \nwith the world, but I know there is a deep undercurrent \nthat I hope will one day assert its supremacy and flow\non a strong full stream unruffled by the little pebbles of \nambition or fashion. \nI really hope Julie has a good girl by this time or that the baby \nis better, you did not say anthing about the children or

Showing up Jane, a part of the cloud has faded and \nI suppose the rest will. I will send a small package, a spring suit \nto one of the boys, by one of our delgates. Ewing or Murdock \nprobably. I tell you now so Julia will know, Jane seems to \nenjoy her return altho' she enjoyed her visit so much, we \nfind her very much improved, she seems so different and \nso happy. I suppose you are all convinced now that I did not \nmagnify the evil she suffered I feel safraid? and so very \nthankful, and also appreciated the instrumentality of my darling \nJohnny, and the kindness and filial and sisterly love of his \nlovely wife, much love to her, and a kiss to each dear little one. \nFrom a very devoted and loving Mother, \nthe boys are at a little party this evening so my letter will \nperhaps be delayed again, no great matter is it?","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":47616,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/47616","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/79b2e4a258c1a0956e1c00faa33c5bd4.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/79b2e4a258c1a0956e1c00faa33c5bd4.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/79b2e4a258c1a0956e1c00faa33c5bd4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/79b2e4a258c1a0956e1c00faa33c5bd4.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-09T16:11:52+00:00","modified":"2020-04-25T23:45:11+00:00","filename":"79b2e4a258c1a0956e1c00faa33c5bd4.jpg","authentication":"ba5cd94fc8e93fcf6a925571490b1886","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_le_moyne_box_01_fl_11_06_01_o2.jpg","size":825809,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3600,"resolution_y":2068,"compression_ratio":0.036974756429544},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171101"],"TimeCreated":["231206"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["163916"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171101"],"TimeCreated":["231206"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["163916"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171101"],"TimeCreated":["231206"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["163916"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"79b2e4a258c1a0956e1c00faa33c5bd4.jpg","FileDateTime":1510243672,"FileSize":825809,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3600\" height=\"2068\"","Height":2068,"Width":3600,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"13mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:11:02 13:59:34","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:11:01 23:12:06","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:11:01 23:12:06","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2176,"ExifImageLength":1250,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":211,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/211","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"John Le Moyne\nChicago\nIllinois\nWritten up left side--\nMa\nNov. 1860\nNov. 17 J.V.

William, she came here \na few months ago on a visit, you know they live in \nIowa, the last I heard of Sam he was in Memphis, \nhe is a scamp. Poor Mr. Matthews has lost \nhis little girl, a sweet fat little thing, and of \ncourse a great pet. Mrs M. had been to \nBrighton with her, to visit some friends and \nthe little one took sick, she hurried home \njust in time to die here, she was a fed?\nchild, her mother having never nursed her \nRomaine writes me that her baby is sick \nand there are many deaths in Pittsburg, \namong children, our children are all well \nand getting over the whooping cough. \nWill. Hughes is a shadow but he still keeps about.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":47665,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/47665","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/cbafd45ea993c62c7de20954e264dbfe.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/cbafd45ea993c62c7de20954e264dbfe.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/cbafd45ea993c62c7de20954e264dbfe.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cbafd45ea993c62c7de20954e264dbfe.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-09T16:13:56+00:00","modified":"2020-04-28T00:24:41+00:00","filename":"cbafd45ea993c62c7de20954e264dbfe.jpg","authentication":"b6c0fe8c3a8acf06825c634b8ee92581","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_le_moyne_box_01_fl_12_10_05_o2.jpg","size":1192892,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

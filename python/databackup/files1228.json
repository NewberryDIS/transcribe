Cars filled with \"Bloody Dutchmen\" \"Canada Skunks\" who fill the air with fragrance. this is what they call the Lightning Train I cannot tell what for it stops at almost every House and the only difference there seems to be between this and our roads is that the Houses are not so thick.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97107,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97107","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/87e345926f571592c045edff80bb4be6.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/87e345926f571592c045edff80bb4be6.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/87e345926f571592c045edff80bb4be6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/87e345926f571592c045edff80bb4be6.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-13T18:56:36+00:00","modified":"2020-08-04T17:38:13+00:00","filename":"87e345926f571592c045edff80bb4be6.jpg","authentication":"c81cb5da01e9217383e8b94a35284660","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_869_00009_o2_2.jpg","size":941696,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1872,"resolution_y":2940,"compression_ratio":0.05703432370099},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000115"],"TimeCreated":["222539"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000115"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000115"],"TimeCreated":["222539"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000115"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000115"],"TimeCreated":["222539"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000115"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"87e345926f571592c045edff80bb4be6.jpg","FileDateTime":1586804191,"FileSize":941696,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1872\" height=\"2940\"","Height":2940,"Width":1872,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2940,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop 21.0 (Windows)","DateTime":"2020:02:25 11:32:23","Exif_IFD_Pointer":284},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4066},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:15 22:25:39","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:15 22:25:39","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":75,"SubSecTimeDigitized":75,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1872,"ExifImageLength":2940,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1228,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1228","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"13\nWhew what a country!

looks romantic in the extreme. we reached Dunleith which is the terminus of the Rail Road. at 8 1\/2 O'clock P.M. here we took a crack for the City Hotel and crossed the river on the ice to Du Buque? where we find a friend of Morses' at the Hotel and take rooms with him. after taking a little supper feeling very tired we retired.\nSaturday Jany 19th\nAfter breakfast we started out on a unclear in the midst of a Snow Storm. Du Buque? is a City situated 188 miles from Chicago on the West bank of the Mississippi on a little Peninsula or strip of land between the river and the bluffs. the level land is about half a mile wide and all the business in on the main Street which is about 2 miles long. there are some fine Stores here which are rented at enormously high rates higher than Boston or New York say $1000. for a single room on the first floor. how they do business at a profit is a mystery to me. I suppose however that they bleed the country folk who are obliged to come from a great distance to trade. after examining thoroughly the business part of the city, we took a stroll up on the bluffs which rise to a height of several hundred feet above the river. in some places almost perpendicular. there are some very fine residences. but I should not like the fun of getting up and down. we went out on a rock? that seems to hang almost over the city. in fact it does hang over some buildings though I think they are not dwellings. from this point is one of the most romantic sights that can be imagined. standing several hundred feet above the river one can see every part of the City and in the Summer when the Boats are flying? up and down it must be charmingly beautiful. after dinner we walked across the river to Dunleith which is the terminus of the Illinois Central RR. this company have a splendid Freight Depot build of Stone and are now a passenger Depot a large, commodious, and substantial structure.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97110,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97110","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/71d2ebe9d0b0d7e7657dc9e3c9c6d309.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/71d2ebe9d0b0d7e7657dc9e3c9c6d309.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/71d2ebe9d0b0d7e7657dc9e3c9c6d309.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/71d2ebe9d0b0d7e7657dc9e3c9c6d309.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-13T18:56:40+00:00","modified":"2020-07-22T01:52:28+00:00","filename":"71d2ebe9d0b0d7e7657dc9e3c9c6d309.jpg","authentication":"a944ad72a535d2662d4eaea9efa151f6","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_869_00011_o2_1.jpg","size":1042750,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1872,"resolution_y":2984,"compression_ratio":0.062223477731186},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000115"],"TimeCreated":["222608"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000115"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000115"],"TimeCreated":["222608"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000115"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000115"],"TimeCreated":["222608"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000115"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"71d2ebe9d0b0d7e7657dc9e3c9c6d309.jpg","FileDateTime":1586804192,"FileSize":1042750,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1872\" height=\"2984\"","Height":2984,"Width":1872,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2984,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop 21.0 (Windows)","DateTime":"2020:02:25 11:32:26","Exif_IFD_Pointer":284},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3715},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:15 22:26:08","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:15 22:26:08","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":13,"SubSecTimeDigitized":13,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1872,"ExifImageLength":2984,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1228,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1228","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"16\nopposite the Argyle House a splendid Hotel built also by the R.R.

him to Burlington has been arrested and today he was tried or rather witnesses was examined to see if the Justices would indict him - Some 5 o 6 witnesses were examined by the prosecuting attorney

stop here but the Boat was behind time and it had to push along - soon after leaving Quincy night set in and put a stop to further observations - at 10 oclock I went to my berth and a good looking man

--\nThe joys, and pleasures, sorrows, griefs\nAnd every earthly care --\nLet each the other's virtues laud\nTheir faults too -- gently chide --\nLet each the others purpose know\nAnd every thought confide --\nMay all your efforts ever be\nTo make -- each other happy --\nFor this -- your promises were made --\nThis -- is your bounden duty --\nAnd thus employing talents which\nAre so profusely

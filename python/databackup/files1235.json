Joe says he has blown you up about going to Mass. & it would be foolish to be at that expense merely for pleasure but if some important benefits could be gained it is a question: the benefit to be gained would be by a confidential conference with Uncle Joseph to obtain from him advice and perhaps temporary assistance: if I were you I would not even call on Mrs. Child this time.

I'll risk it you may regret it when it is too late what license have you for disobeying the physical any more than the moral laws or to suppose that you can do it with impunity.  Charles (as usual) is in a heck of perplexities for want of money.  Lucy bothers him about getting married & wants to know when?  He tells if he could only get money to pay for his publishment he should right off he and L have done pretty slick joking now & then - Jane is quite a help about doing chores -  she has a good memory & learns pretty well.

She and Eliab came home in Stage last Monday.  We've had a very pleasant time not withstanding a good deal of hurry & flurry as usual.  I told the folks that if you only had money plenty by you, would  be here too as suppose'd they would not object to a vacation your school is so long.  Joseph was home 2 or 3 weeks ago was about here a week buying things-etc etc.\nAlmeda and her two Daughters started the 18th of last month went on board the Boat the 19th.  Had a rough passage got into Boston the 21st.  Mrs Caroline Chase sent her sometime since a  very cordial invitation to come with all her children and spend the winter with her.  She will leave Lucy with her annt Rachel Thomson in Sutton perhaps to stay a year which she & Lizzy spend the winter writing about - Charles carried them to Bangor and see them aboard etc went with 2 horses.  He is always willing you know to do what is thought best  it cost him a dollar more besides his time and team but we all thought it best as it would be pleasanter for her.  Charles and Lucy had an invitation to attend a Scholars Picnic Friday evening at the Academy Foxcroft - so Anna & Eliab concluded to go too so Charles hurried  about all day borrow'd sleigh & harness and riggd in both horses and got started about 3 o clock calculating to spend the night there and this morn go on to Bangor.  Lucy goes back with them expects to spend the winter  there go to school and assist Ann - She'll write you all about it soon I guess.  I am dreadfully press's with work for little Jamie etc and need her help and her company but was very willing she should go - be for her good I hope with quite a benefit to Ann too - you enquire about a wedding - not very soon I guess Albina begins  a school in the Rollins district next Monday 2 month I have not been so inform'd but I guess that they would have been married perhaps by this time had it not been for the lack of the Rhino?

They carry on an immense sight of business & he is (Joseph says) the main spoke in the wheel.  Joseph is philosophical, curious and critecising -Eliab has more politeness more natural good feeling perhaps - more versatility and expansiveness of mind but perhaps I have not expressed just my ideas for lack of the right words.  You are as you say not much acquainted  with him.  I wish you were more so he would be perhaps as good a correspondent  as Jo if you give him the opportunity.

I should suppose you would hardly feel or look fit to be seen.  Am glad you call'd at Mrs Childs.  I have been somewhat apprehensive that A \"would wear her welcome out\u201d at Mr. Chases - I am not at all acquainted with him but your Father knew his family well they were very low.  He had no education - & it feels if perhaps  he is a man of few words.  Head down always.

So rich they stir up feelings within me that I cannot express or define but my intellect is dark so that a little light dazzles it I suppose.\nYou say you dread to go into your school again you should try to \"take it easy\" make it a pleasure to you as L does.  But after all the easiest way and the only easy way is to be every moment on the alert and see everything before it happens - tis much better to prevent than cure.

I presume you are a very good teacher but better for large scholars -  But I think it more important even, that young children be well taught than older ones.  Lucy seems to have a real \"gift\" for teaching.  She was applied to teach this winter the school she taught last Summer.  I think she has a fine opportunity at Bangor am very glad to have her there - tho' I miss her company very much and so does Charles - he thinks, she is one of a thousand says she is worthy of the very best man there is.\nCharles has been to Bangor this week says there is a tremendous excitement there with the rum sellers -Eliab has been very active in ferreting out and getting evidence etc and has the praise and gratitude of many of the first in society for his","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97758,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97758","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c4c30f4047b1a667bc005439bf20ab43.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/c4c30f4047b1a667bc005439bf20ab43.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/c4c30f4047b1a667bc005439bf20ab43.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c4c30f4047b1a667bc005439bf20ab43.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:32:56+00:00","modified":"2020-08-05T19:40:38+00:00","filename":"c4c30f4047b1a667bc005439bf20ab43.jpg","authentication":"bcacbe8b4aef85903d17039dff95b8b1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_78_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1629397,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2961,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050952412223098},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180627"],"TimeCreated":["005709"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180627"],"TimeCreated":["005709"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180627"],"TimeCreated":["005709"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c4c30f4047b1a667bc005439bf20ab43.jpg","FileDateTime":1587317548,"FileSize":1629397,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2961\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2961,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:27 13:17:47","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:27 00:57:09","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:27 00:57:09","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3315,"ExifImageLength":4030,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1235,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1235","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Craft and fearlessness about it.

He and another fellow went into Vinton & Porters great establishment and call'd for pie etc. - then for Brandt & slyly bottled it & carried it off for evidence.\n\n  But tis nonsense for me to write you all this I suppose you get much more of the Bangor news than I do. And the family near I suppose you have over and over a different version from each one it may be. But I feel somewhat more inclin'd to write & to read when I can have the time when I've nobody hardly to talk with\n  I am not troubled with too much stillness my young'uns are full of noise & frolic. James goes to school with Hiram he learns finely & is got to be quite a smart manly little fellow he is very good natur'd & full of fun & delights in hectoring Jane as much as you us'd to Joseph Jane does not go to school but I endeavor to drill her here at home and she gets along about as fast as he does she is quicker at Reconing than he is the worst thing about James is he is very selfish - not much to blame bred in the bone- but tis very easy to make him as harn'd of it.\n I think they are both very good children but I have to Spell P-a-t-i-e-n-c-e sometimes - James has learn'd to read surprisingly since he came here to stay & the credit of it belongs to me tho' I say it.\n  It seems sometimes that Charles is doom'd to always work hard to no purpose or no benefit to himself - ten thousand little disastrous ocurences such as he could neither foresee or avoid why is it? is it not because he does not seek first the kingdom of heaven - but trusts in his own strength - He has been disappointed and bother'd \"every which way,, about getting his Hay press'd wants to sell 12 or 15 Tons including 4 or 5 of Almeda's but there is no prospect of selling it here at more than 5 or 6$ pr

She means to go back there by the first of next week I hate her go but perhaps it is best - I wish I could be there too I should be very glad to be making you some shirts if I can get some cloth.  And I will be knitting you some stockings, tell if there is any thing else I can do for you - you must not forget to write me all about yourself and everything I want to know and in particular what you intend to do with yourself in future.  Do you mean to continue to teach, or do you aspire to something else after a time.  Do write.  If I could fly like a dove I would see you very soon.\nGod bless you my Son.\n\n\nB.M Frees\nM.J Ring\nH.W. Ramsdell:\nM.J Bray\nA.R Frost\nH.C Bond\nH.

She went down with Sam'l was going to Hampden too to look at the House where she expects to live next Summer.

I must send by Wednesday's mail, so I'll write a few words tonight though I don't know as 'tis truly necessary to write again. Your kind letter without any particular date - was rec'd last night, and very glad we were to see it, as we had been waiting to hear from you before making a final decision on the time. The V I was sorry to see! though it showed your thoughtfulness and dear brotherly kindness, for I feel that you ought not to send it. The \"braces\" I think would be very beneficial to me, and I intend to have them, if obtainable in Bangor, but the \"lining\" of your last letter I intend to return to you. I am so glad you are coming and do hope you will be able to be here a week or fortnight before the 17th, also I shall have no time to see you, hardly.\n\nMother is all ready - could go just as well as next week as any time, as for that. I feel really relieved that she is going - she will enjoy herself so much better than here alone with Albina all summer. 'Tis for the best good of all parties that she absent herself a while, I think. I believe Ann has written you all her plans - which by the way are not few - for coming home, when she wants you to be in Bangor to come up with them etc. I believe the last plan is to get a carriage and all come up together guests & all Sat. or Mond. previous. Ann is \"all agog\" as the saying is.

I think truthfulness, sincerity is a marked trait in his character. He has spoken of uniting with the church. We shall attend meeting at the Hall in Bangor, & he will probably join that church. Have I not great reason for gratitude to God for His many mercies, and especially for this. He goes to Hampden the first of next week to stay till the rest of the folks come home?   \n\n  You kindly caution me about my health - much obliged but I do think you would do well to heed your own advice on that subject.

if your Uncle writes to you let me know and I dont know but it would be a good plan to let Uncle Enochs folks know that I am here and as they do visit at Royalston once in a while they may possibly make it convenient to come. I dont think I had better try to go to Lowell if they want to see me they can come to Royalston. I had a letter from Lucy as you know, & I sent it by Mr. Parsons the next day he said he handed it to Mr. Field the same day why have you not seen it.\n I am very sorry I did'nt call on Mrs. Piper got all - ready to that day I came away but the wind blew so hard I could not very well - had I better make my calculations to go to Royalston and return again to Warwick or go there last and start for home from there I shall probably be at Mr. Williams last part of next week. If you think it best and can conveniently come to Brother Josephs Some Saturday let me know when and I'll endeavor to be there\n\n[In light pencil] The shirts I have made will be durable they are stout, but not very handsome. I could not do them up so nice as Lucy would the linnen is altogether to course Ann bought it I guess she was deceived about the fineness of it, keep the Handkerchief till I see you.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97791,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97791","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/3e27d19d78786e23766f93320e1a15d4.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/3e27d19d78786e23766f93320e1a15d4.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/3e27d19d78786e23766f93320e1a15d4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3e27d19d78786e23766f93320e1a15d4.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:33:41+00:00","modified":"2020-08-07T21:22:34+00:00","filename":"3e27d19d78786e23766f93320e1a15d4.jpg","authentication":"d6677cb6802682f92c426cfd8eaa992f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_79_007_001_o2.jpg","size":1998817,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3600,"resolution_y":3512,"compression_ratio":0.052698077490931},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["231427"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["231427"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["231427"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3e27d19d78786e23766f93320e1a15d4.jpg","FileDateTime":1587317550,"FileSize":1998817,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3600\" height=\"3512\"","Height":3512,"Width":3600,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:27 13:19:10","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:26 23:14:27","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:26 23:14:27","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3268,"ExifImageLength":3189,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1235,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1235","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"[left-hand side in pencil] the clock has just said 10 & as usual I am thinking of you & my other children.

I fear She is going in the dark and will - Stumble\n you will know how to direct a letter to her I suppose  I wish I had a Report of the Society perhaps you have it - there are 2 Societies the one she is going to is the one that Governor Slade was President or Director of I dont know who is now.

When he was taking those powerful stimulants last summer, it was considerable time after it was plainly evident to me and to him that it was injuring him before he would leave taking it and then not till he had written to Dr. Rich - when he had the same as told him that he didn't know what to do for him but he might by such & such things \n\n Now Dr. Prescott has told him that he thought the Water Treatment cannot help him and has written to Eliab to that effect. I feel so distress'd sometimes to think he is there alone for strangers to experiment upon I can hardly bear it. He needs a kind friend or Brother with him. He has an exceedingly refin'd and exalted mind - But I think you even dont fully understand him he is not (now at least) fit to judge for himself in every circumstance as Eliab would be.\n  I have all along thought his best chance if not the only one for him to get well was to be quiet & do nothing but wait and let nature alone conquer the disease. Still I've been afraid not to have him try.\n A while ago he wrote me that his hand and arm continued to fail  - in his last letter he said there were some symptoms a little more favorable but I didn't think much of it because he has so many time had his hopes rais'd from the merest trifles. If his lameness can not be help'd is it right to wear out and exaust his system in vain attempts so that he can never enjoy anything.\n But how I have run on & scratch I down my thoughts just as fast and just as they come into my head. But you must consider it and take it for what it is worth remembering it is only the cogitations of simple old woman but take care when you have read to burn it.\n\nwhen I hear from you again which I

anything that I dont let him read haven't before am writing with my papers in my lap when it is time I was abed doubtful whether you can read it all\n\nChickens are big enough so he eats them now he is very much taken up with \"Prescotts Mexico  & Peru\"\nthis is scratch'd off in such a haste I wish you would burn it even as you have read

He was a very fine fellow, 22 years old - had been at California two & a half years - on his way home took the Chagus fever,  (They call it) stopped at the Adams house in Boston, where he was robbed of his hard earned gold. He reached home and died in four days. His father two hundred miles away in the woods, exploring, and they don't know where to send for him. If you could get all the letters we have written, you would know every thing that has transpired since you went away, but I cannot remember to write it now. Mr. Tibbits is here now - boards here - finishing the house. Now for my health. In my last letter, I wrote in high glee about it. I was gaining very fast but during the hot weather that followed I melted down and lost my strength in a measure. It is now cool, and I think I am gaining again. My chair was carried up stairs three weeks ago. Then I went out round the house twice - now I get about the house on my feet quite comfortably. Do be very careful & write very often. Aff. Sis Lucy.\n[left-hand side] I hope you will get this letter- I know how anxious you must feel to hear.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97865,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97865","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/85a21c77c951a3b578cd8deb62464e4a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/85a21c77c951a3b578cd8deb62464e4a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/85a21c77c951a3b578cd8deb62464e4a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/85a21c77c951a3b578cd8deb62464e4a.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:35:24+00:00","modified":"2020-08-12T20:05:32+00:00","filename":"85a21c77c951a3b578cd8deb62464e4a.jpg","authentication":"33b113f5330c9df135742f4986ba1b82","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_81_002_001_o2.jpg","size":1545807,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2872,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049836447694212},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["232910"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["232910"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["232910"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"85a21c77c951a3b578cd8deb62464e4a.jpg","FileDateTime":1587317554,"FileSize":1545807,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2872\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2872,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:27 13:24:20","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:26 23:29:10","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:26 23:29:10","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3204,"ExifImageLength":4015,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1235,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1235","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Mother Bangor Maine\nSept 6. 1851\nJonesboro Oct 1851                                                                                               Bangor Sept. 6th 1851\n\n                    My Dear Son, \n                                               Eliab got home to our good joy Tuesday  Sept 2nd} his Health is better than when he went away He seems to have enjoy'd his journey.

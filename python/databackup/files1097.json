She is very generous. the wet weather dont agree with her - it gives her Rhumatism, and gout\nKenilworth is looking beautiful the frequent rains we have had makes the grass so green - and all the trees are so clean, and the foliage so full, to me this place is prettier than Lake Forest, as our houses are nearer each other, and our streets and sidewalks, so good, and our depot is a pretty place.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":76996,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/76996","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7cd41fa919b5a4606a88b067ede9d7db.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7cd41fa919b5a4606a88b067ede9d7db.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7cd41fa919b5a4606a88b067ede9d7db.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7cd41fa919b5a4606a88b067ede9d7db.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-13T15:26:19+00:00","modified":"2020-03-30T23:03:50+00:00","filename":"7cd41fa919b5a4606a88b067ede9d7db.jpg","authentication":"c810115a33d5d1df73bc8590601f077e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":180,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03b_182_o2.jpg","size":1226920,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2406,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047216834457067},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180105"],"TimeCreated":["154445"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180105"],"TimeCreated":["154445"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180105"],"TimeCreated":["154445"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7cd41fa919b5a4606a88b067ede9d7db.jpg","FileDateTime":1531495554,"FileSize":1226920,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2406\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2406,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:10 15:58:15","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:05 15:44:45","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:05 15:44:45","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":7,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1766,"ExifImageLength":2642,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803254,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1097,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1097","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"To night I was taken with severe pains in my head - I think it was indigestion - it did not last long - \nFriday, June 27, 1902\nToday is cloudy and cool. at noon we had a slight shower. but it seems clearing we are all well. \nI had a nice postal from Mrs Shrene (my sister Belle Sheridan) from Lake Forest.

Her mother Mrs. John Dwight is sick in bed at her North side home with Lumbago.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":77000,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/77000","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d230f5bed608d815896bd1e3927ed8c1.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d230f5bed608d815896bd1e3927ed8c1.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d230f5bed608d815896bd1e3927ed8c1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d230f5bed608d815896bd1e3927ed8c1.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-13T15:26:23+00:00","modified":"2020-04-01T20:44:14+00:00","filename":"d230f5bed608d815896bd1e3927ed8c1.jpg","authentication":"69013524c4381889743632c10138dbaa","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":184,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03b_186_o2.jpg","size":1247599,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2400,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048132677469136},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180105"],"TimeCreated":["154506"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180105"],"TimeCreated":["154506"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180105"],"TimeCreated":["154506"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d230f5bed608d815896bd1e3927ed8c1.jpg","FileDateTime":1531495554,"FileSize":1247599,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2400\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2400,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:10 15:58:21","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:05 15:45:06","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:05 15:45:06","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":98,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1762,"ExifImageLength":2642,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803254,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1097,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1097","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Mrs. A.

So I did not know what to do - as it poured rain. at last it ceased raining and I rushed into my clothes and took Ed Wilson, the coloured Coachman with my satchel and after a long walk reached the Illinois Central, got on and reached the Marshall Feild building at half past three - waited a long time there to see my daughter Belle - but she had gone to telephone me - as it was getting near the train time to meet Mr. Badger I hurried off.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":77092,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/77092","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/8d19adc7298e03e13537f4e0110f34a2.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/8d19adc7298e03e13537f4e0110f34a2.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/8d19adc7298e03e13537f4e0110f34a2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8d19adc7298e03e13537f4e0110f34a2.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-13T15:32:51+00:00","modified":"2020-04-23T03:34:04+00:00","filename":"8d19adc7298e03e13537f4e0110f34a2.jpg","authentication":"bbee7c3d6fabfbdcc523374a9cc46f55","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03b_278_o2.jpg","size":1203303,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2454,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.045402177850222},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180108"],"TimeCreated":["101216"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180108"],"TimeCreated":["101216"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180108"],"TimeCreated":["101216"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8d19adc7298e03e13537f4e0110f34a2.jpg","FileDateTime":1531495951,"FileSize":1203303,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2454\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2454,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:10 16:00:40","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:08 10:12:16","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:08 10:12:16","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":29,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1788,"ExifImageLength":2622,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803254,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1097,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1097","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Wednesday, October 1, 1902 Mr A.C.

I am afraid she will lose her Chicago trip - as it would be very dangerous, to dress then for the wedding, and drive so far - in the cold - we are trying to persuade her to give it up - I think she will.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":77166,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/77166","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/8727bdc470f070a3e2791c28e0b82004.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/8727bdc470f070a3e2791c28e0b82004.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/8727bdc470f070a3e2791c28e0b82004.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8727bdc470f070a3e2791c28e0b82004.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-13T15:36:38+00:00","modified":"2020-05-05T20:32:57+00:00","filename":"8727bdc470f070a3e2791c28e0b82004.jpg","authentication":"305d848580c67e96121f08a32c9c93aa","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03b_352_o2.jpg","size":1124477,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2498,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041680640808943},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180108"],"TimeCreated":["102112"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180108"],"TimeCreated":["102112"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180108"],"TimeCreated":["102112"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8727bdc470f070a3e2791c28e0b82004.jpg","FileDateTime":1531496151,"FileSize":1124477,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2498\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2498,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:10 16:02:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:08 10:21:12","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:08 10:21:12","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1831,"ExifImageLength":2638,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803254,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1097,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1097","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Tuesday, December 16, 1902\nMr W.

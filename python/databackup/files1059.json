Cherokee Nation May 16, 1828\nDear Madam,\nIt is a year since I wrote to you; But I understand that you have not recieved the letter. In my other letter, I mentioned the love I had towards Mrs. Dean, and how much good she has done me. I mentioned that they left their son here. I took care of it while it was here and at my fathers. They had it there five or six months. I loved both of their children very much as well as I do my brothers and sisters. When Mr. and Mrs. Dean went away I was not here, I was at my fathers taking care of their son. I wished to see them before they went away. They were father and mother to me, and it almost makes me shed tears to think about them and how many pleasant hours I spent in working with her and playing with Chester. There has been more attention to religion at this Station and in this neighbourhood than usual. Among others the girls of this school? have thought more about the Saviour and that that they were sinners. Some of them think that their sins are forgiven. I have thought more than I did and some times I think they my heart is changed and at times I am doubtful.

Perhaps you have no heard of the seriousness that has been at this station, if you have not it would no doubt, be interesting to hear of it. There has been much more feeling at this place upon the subject of religion since you left us. Many have felt the need of a Saviour. We were afraid it was decreasing and I do not think there is so much feeling in the school but we are more encouraged about the neighbours. We have great reason to praise the Lord for His goodness and for His wonderful works to the children of men. We lately received a letter from Mr. Holland which informs us that the Lord is carrying on His work there. They hope four are born again and many inquiring what they should do to be saved. he says there are six different places that he holds meetings besides the Sabbath. He likewise mentioned that last Sabbath there was the largest audience he ever witnessed, since his residence at that place. What glorious news to hear of sinners turning to the Lord It ought to rejoice the hearts of all christians. But to return to this station from which I have digressed.

When a child I was often affected with a sense of sin  as I grew older these seasons became more frequent. I never could go to class without first saying a few words in the form of a prayer. About a year since the family were much encouraged with the appearance of a reival of religion. Some of the children were deeply affected also the neighbors paid better attention to preaching. I then had a realizing sense of my danger while out of Christ. Before this I had an idea religion would make me gloomy and melancholy. I found many obstacles in the way. I endeavoured to make myself a little better so Christ would not have so many sins to pardon: the more I tried the more sinful I appeared to myself. In a few days I trust I was enabled to feel willing Christ should do all and have the glory.

I sometimes imagine that you may feel bad that you have a daughter so far from you; and when I look upon my dear teacher it makes me pity her very much because she is so far away from her dear mother, brother, and sisters. I sometimes think that I should be willing that she should leave the school to visit you, though I should be sorry to part with her. I do not know that she wishes to go, for she says she is as happy as she was in teaching in New England. She rejoices me very much when she receives letters. I watched the mail and when it arrives, I tell her and she says \"go and see if I have any letters.\" Yesterday she received one from Virginia, and I had one from a lady in Charleston. I did not wait to get mine but caught up hers and ran to her and forgot mine. I think I feel as sorry as she does when there is none for her. I can write more than I could say if you were here.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71500,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/71500","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/0016bef613c7b315220620c1b219eb88.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/0016bef613c7b315220620c1b219eb88.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/0016bef613c7b315220620c1b219eb88.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0016bef613c7b315220620c1b219eb88.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T14:07:25+00:00","modified":"2020-09-03T21:39:40+00:00","filename":"0016bef613c7b315220620c1b219eb88.jpg","authentication":"9acc85f1c87cd1c3860274fd22032dd0","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL08_FL001_00016_o2.jpg","size":528436,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2179,"compression_ratio":0.044909829517448},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["`"],"DateCreated":["20120620"],"TimeCreated":["085414+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["`"],"DateCreated":["20120620"],"TimeCreated":["085414+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[" `"],"DateCreated":["20120620"],"TimeCreated":["085414+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0016bef613c7b315220620c1b219eb88.jpg","FileDateTime":1522678012,"FileSize":528436,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2179\"","Height":2179,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2179,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:17:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3934},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:20 08:54:14","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:20 08:54:14","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":94,"SubSecTimeOriginal":94,"SubSecTimeDigitized":94,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2179,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1059,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1059","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I think more than I can talk.

Today Miss Ames is troubled with a pain in her head and she has the larger scholars help the classes while she sits and hears whether they read and spell right. I will relate a circumstance to you that has lately taken place at this station about two week ago a traveler came to this place he was sick and the family did everything for him they thought better he send for his friends, one of the family went about fifty miles for them and when he returned with them the Cherokee officers came to take him. He had stolen a horse from one of the Cherokees and sold it in the white settlement,  the officers had him chained a week till he got better and on monday they came. they came and took him to have his trial. Miss Ames says I may relate something of my father's family he is an elder of this church he is an interpreter, he has eight children at this school besides myself, my brother Samuel has gone through his course of his studies he united with the church before he left he now resides with his mother who married a cherokee man; but he is not contented and wishes him to work on the sabbath.

I then think I see the importance of being prepared to meet God, and I say in my heart I will try to seek religion. But then my attention is taken up with other things and I forget these promises.

Others, besides attending to domestic affairs, are employed in making and mending the boys clothes and in doing the ?mm..? sewing for the family. It is between four and five months since the scholars returned from their homes, after vacation. Since that time we have made nearly forty frocks, besides other garments. The parents of the children brought the cloth for the greatest part of them. Some of them are calico to wear on sabbath days and the others to wear on other days of the week are Cherokee cotton cloth which they spun and wove themselves. We had some calico and American gingham sent to us as for events by the friends of the missionaries to whom we have written. They are to wear sabbath days.

She says that she is a friend to the missionaries and that she used to do a great deal for them she used to make garments and send them out to their indians. She says that she came from the same place where she used to visit and she used to go around about the towns and beg money to support missionaries. Miss Ames has just read her letter to Miss Sargent to us. I was very much pleased to hear that she had so large a number of scholars. She said a great many people in Georgia had become Christian and a great number of them had joined the church like wise she mentioned some of her scholars become christian and a number of sabbath school teachers. I did not know that there were so many that were christians. I do not think these christian people wish us to remove. I think they wish us to be civilized and be like their christian people. I have read much in the papers about the Georgians wishing the Cherokees to remove from their native country. We have a charitable society among ourselves. We have heard what was doing among other people in their societies. We thought that we could form one. It is not long since our society was established.

She belonged to the Methodist Church\nand she joined the Church at the place  that Summer. She is very\nkind to me indeed I have been living with her ever since I was\na year old perhaps you remember her. Her name is Katy Van\nShe was home yesterday to meeting. She told me that she \nhad been to a neighborhood about twenty miles from Brainerd\nShe said a Cherokee man and his wife feel more about\ntheir souls than ever did before that they did not \nseem to forget it. She said the people round\nfelt suspicious to hear the words of God. First? that\nmade them think about their souls they had a little\nson that got burnt to death. Stephen ?man? was \npassing through the neighborhood he stayed all night.\nAnd the people met together and they felt anxious to \nhave a meeting.

And I think we ought to be very thankful that the good people at the North has done so much for the Cherokees. We have no minister in this place he has removed to another station so he could learn the Cherokees language. We do not have any preaching other than once in two months except when some ministers from the neighboring Stations or some traveling minister calls. And I am going to ask you one question will you please Mr Thatcher to ask the Board to send in a minister? I will tell you how the Cherokees live they generally live in log houses and cabbins, though some have framed ones. Some of our neighbors go to the next of government and to the neightboring states and see how civilized people build houses and they begin to live a little as they do. They have gardens and cultivate fields some of them have ?een? sheep, horses, and a great many swine. They have all kinds of fruits such as are peaches apples pears and the veggatables are sweet potatos, beans, peas corn, groundnuts, and turnips &c. which they raise for their family to live on. But a great many of the Cherokees are poor and ignorant and live so poorly that they have scarcely any houses or clothes there they often go to those families that can take care of themselves and if such families do not mention them they think they are stingy.

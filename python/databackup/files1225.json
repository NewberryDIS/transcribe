In conversing with the switchmen I find that they remember how the striking engineers acted during the switchmens' strike some time since. The switchmen claim that the switch engineers at that time instead of attending strictly to their own line of business also performed the duties of the switchmen. Many railroad men think the firm stand taken by the \"Q\" road in the present contest will be a great help towards preventing railroad strikes in the future. They also think that had the company yielded to the demands of the strikers trouble would be likely to occur in other departments during the summer. There is a growing belief that the strikers will, before a great while, come back and ask to be re-instated in their former positions and agree to the terms and conditions that the company has dictated.\" \nYours respectfully,\nPinkertons Natl.

Stone Esq.\nGenl. Mang. C.B.&Q. R.R.\nChicago\nDear Sir, Following find report of Opr D.D.C. dated at Chicago Friday Auf 3d 1888. Opr reports remained at home during forenoon. Afternoon Opr went up past the Hall & from there to Noonan Bros but did not see any one until after meeting when there was 8 or 9 came in from there. Opr talked with Mike Shields, Shorty, Allen, Campbell, Printy, unclear and Tom Larkin. All said it was too hot to do any business in the Hall and that there was none to do anyway - they say things are just the same. That they go up there, read the communications from along the line call the roll and adjourn. They say the men will ever give in and if the strike is settled it will by by concessions from the Company- the $40.00 per month makes the Boys very loyal to the Cause. There were 8 or 10 strikers in Noonan Bros. who were unknown to Opr. They were going some where so Opr stayed there until 11.35 they had all gone but 2 or 3 and they came away when Opr did. \nSaturday August 4th 1888.

It being pay day on the Santa Fe. There were a number of the Santa Fe men out having a Time. They expressed themselves freely and assured each other that the Q Company was on its last legs and that the Strike would never be declared off until the Schedule was signed in short, they seemed to have appointed themselves a Committee to brace up the Strikers. \nOpr thought they might do damage as they were in a condition which led him to believe they should be watched closely there fore he kept an extra close watch on them remaining as near them as possible and went over the Track where Trains pulled out but none of the parties came down and nothing of any importance occurred.

Athol Mass. Mr. Cushing has received unfavorable inteligence from his daughter when he but recently left there, and will start on Monday to go after her, and will probably place her at some other institution of the kind: He expects to visit Gorham and perhaps Waterford, and if he is better satisfied with the institution at either of these places, than with the one at Athol, he will place her at one or the other of them. He will write to me relative to the merits of the several institutions, upon his arrival in Boston upon the reception of which I will communicate with you again: In the mean time, you can write and get the times upon which make patients are received at the different institutions. I feel a deep and most sincere interest in behalf of your brother Joseph, and will render you any assistance which mat be within my power to aid you in your endeavors to put him in possession of his health again. Please say to him from me, \"Be of good courage, never despair.\" Yours truly, Joseph Treat 2d","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}]

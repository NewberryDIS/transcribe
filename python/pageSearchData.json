Last Sunday Mr. Gray informed me that you had received no intelligence from your brother Charles for some time, and that you were very much distressed on his account. I thought if the little information of which I am possessed, (although it is some time since I received it, and you may have heard from him since then,) would relieve your minds any, I would give it you. Last summer Aunt Sarah received letters from her husband, and in one of them he mentioned, that in his travels he had met with your brother at one of the mines. He was then well and seemed in very good spirits. I hope however that you will soon hear from him, and be relieved of your anxiety. Perhaps he may be like a young man whom I met last summer at my Aunt's. He had neglected writing so long, that he thought at last it would be of no use to write. His friends were very anxious about him, and came to the conclusion that he must be dead when suddenly to their great joy and surprise he made his appearance. I hope that it may prove? this in your case. We did not know that Charles had gone to California, until he had been there sometime. We were informed of it by some of our friends from the country. When you write, (which I hope you will soon,) you must tell us all about him, and if he is doing well, and how long he intended to be gone. Tell us about the rest of your family, and about yourselves, and every thing that you think we shall take an interest in. I suppose now you would like to hear from your friends down this way. But allow me to say to you before I commence, that I feel more acquainted with you now, than when I commenced writing.", "itemid": "172", "category": "Family papers; Letters (Correspondence); Women", "date": [1851, 1871], "lang": "English", "title": "Nathan Kendall and Abby J.

A prairie storm is a terrifying thing. The lightening was blinding, the thunder deafening; the willos beside the creek bent in long sweeping curves, leaves were torn from the trees, and branches of the cotton-woods snapped and fell. Torches which, but a few moments before, were seen moving about neighboring camps were extinguished. The rain struck; it came in horizontal sheets, all the broad world was shut out in the onrush; each raindrop was like the prick of a needle.

Any nation of people on the face of the Earth, driven out of their country, and from the graves of their parents and children, and \"forced into their last ditch,\" by the weapons of soldiery, and the fiendish use of them will become fiends.\nThe world know that I have devoted a long life of toil with many privations, in preserving for history and ethnology, what I have seen and admired amongst the North American Indians before \"fiends\" got amongst them, and they will easily appreciate the painful feelings I have at seeing the \"Conquering hero\", with more than 5000 miles of frontier under his command and at least the lives of 200.000 humans beings yet at his mercy (of which he is judge, jury, and executioner) beginning his onslaught as he has done with the Pi\u00e9gans, and proclaiming in his letter, the coming fate of the rest.\nThe removal of Indians into the Reservations, is generally thought to be an easy and a good thing, because people mostly have but an imperfect knowledge of it and its results. Heretofore the credulous Indians have been cajoled into them, being told that there they would be out of the reach of civilization, and have an abundance of game; but by the present policy, when they are no longer willing to move, they are to be \"forced\" into them.\nEvery part of the continent, from ocean to ocean, was found peopled with savages, each tribe claiming and hunting over a tract of country just supplying them food enough for their subsistence; and so they have remained to the present day, where they have not been removed. Each tribe, jealous of its own boundaries and its game, has mostly held the surrounding tribes in a state of hostility and warfare; and the consequence of this is, that in any, the remotest part of the great West, every tract of country into which a removed tribe as placed, (it it be capable of sustaining a population) is already peopled with Indians who claim it as their birthright--their own, and every such tract, even to the Pacific coast, is at this time more or less occupied also, by a squatter population of whites.\nThe results of removing tribes of Indians into these reserves, therefore, are trespass on the rights of other Indians, under new and deadly feuds of both parties, and death from starvation, where there is an increase of consumers, and an absolute deficiency of food; and in all the reservations the other misfortune of the Indians, (and which has been the principal cause of their removals) their destructive contiguity to white men, is actually increased; as all the arable lands in the remote reservations will be occupied, even before the Indians get there, by squatters who get their farms on the Indian Reserves for nothing.\nThe original occupiers and owners of the soil, thus trespassed upon by two enemies, and the feuds and warfare that must consequently arise with United States troops, already trained in butcheries, and sworn \"to protect the settlers\" instead of the fiends\") it is easy to see in the horizon, the reality of Extermination about which you enquire -- the going down of the sun (and its last glimmering rays) of the North American Indians.

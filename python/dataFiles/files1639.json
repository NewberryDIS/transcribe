Looking forward to that, a new experience, and I've always liked the music of the Mass. The Father is a delightful guy, very recently from Eire with an engaging Irish lilt. It should be quite something, hearing Latin intoned with a Kildare flavour.\nI'm celling with a musician from Milwaukee; very quiet cat, fastidious in the extreme, very good for me, since I am somewhat of a slob.\nSo I begin the pursuit of my M.

Park of the bread I used to transport my gear from Jax, then bought a few frivolities to ease the austerity. As for the magazine subscription, I am simply overwhelmed. It could not come at a better time, laughs I madly need, in a situation (another) of rather glutinous sensuality. How I draw these ingenue lits, I don't know. \nHow to properly thank you, I don't know. I can only say that I am profoundly heartened by your thoughtfulness.\nMy work here now centers mostly around the Temple, as we call the prison chapel. I play the organ for both Catholic and Protestant services, and have been appointed director of the chair. In time, I hope to try some experiments in writing a sort of 'progressive' (horrible word) choral music. Ecclesiastical music as it stands (aside from Faure and a few other giants) is a hangdog affair, so Uriah Heep-ish.\nParis Review tells me a thing of mine will appear in the fall issue, along with a Hemingway interview. I'm getting the benefit of a promotion stunt, 25'000 copies distributed, which gives me, in the tinplate jargon of Madison Avenue, \"exposure in depth\". Sounds faintly nasty. We're living in a wonderful age.\nHow shall I entreat you to write more, to tell me what you're doing, thinking, feeling; how you're weathering it? Let me hear.\never,\nJim\nPS.

I first became aware of it through reading a synopsis of \"The Disinherited\" in Rideout's \"The Radical novel in the US- 1900-1954\" plus the many mentions of  you & the book throughout his work, which make you seem very familiar to me.

In seeking out people to interview that were old enough (& politically advanced enough) to know what the hell was going on in '34 but yet are not senile today has proved to be quite a problem. I was directed to a Madge Hawkins who is 88 yrs. old and an old agrarian radical from the Dakotas who resettled in Mpls in the early 30's & immediately proceeded to get involved.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":144777,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/144777","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/a3a2aa5c6c6928a758be4d5bb4e581c6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/a3a2aa5c6c6928a758be4d5bb4e581c6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/a3a2aa5c6c6928a758be4d5bb4e581c6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a3a2aa5c6c6928a758be4d5bb4e581c6.jpg"},"added":"2023-04-04T19:48:42+00:00","modified":"2023-06-20T16:44:06+00:00","filename":"a3a2aa5c6c6928a758be4d5bb4e581c6.jpg","authentication":"65cee12d9976c248753235b990f460aa","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"992006198805867_midwest_ms_conroy_box_00093_fl_03003_000086.jpg","size":81431,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":745,"resolution_y":1200,"compression_ratio":0.03036204325130499592777510997620993293821811676025390625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00093], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00093], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00093], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1639,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1639","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"2)\nShe is a fabulous person with a very retentive mind & manages to stay on top of everything today to the point where she dazzles you.

If she could tell you what the cost would be of xeroxing the two issues of underlined: Public Welfare in New Mexico I could send her the money so that she could have the xeroxes done there and then sent on to your [sic] for Yale. You could then make any comments you wanted to in the margin. She certainly ought not to pay for this nor ought you. It can be one of my little tokens of appreciation for all your generosity. Certainly these two issues ought to be part of your archives.\nMany thanks for sending me the T.P.J. Sampler. Rose Graubart had already sent me one, and I think one to you also, but I can add this to the others. I did like David Ignatow's poem in it as you did. Thanks too for the issue of the Pembroke Magazine. Actually, you know, you can send these as 4th class mail underlined: even if you put annotation on it.  Similarly for the copy of Steven Mooney's book underlined: The Grave of the Dwarf.  I guess my centuries of New England background make me over-thrifty in terms of the mail. But I hate to see you pay 80 cents for sending on to me what Rose sent to you for 12 cents. I notice that the book is dedicated to the two Ignatows. \nWhen I opened the last of the large envelopes that have accumulated I see that it does come from Kris herself in which she tells me roughly what it would cost to make the xerox copies of the two issues. I will send her the amount. She also sent xerox copies of the letters of which we have carbon copies from you and I will see that she gets reimbursed for that. Her letter was really an exceptionally nice one and I am delighted to have it. She uses bobby pins for paperclips and the result is attractively feminine.\nAs for the copy of underlined:  A Return to Pagany I will have to keep that by me a little until the pressure is off me enough so that I can read it.  Then I will turn it over to the archives, where it will find a home because of your annotation.\nThis has been another long and certainly often interrupted letter but I am grateful for all that you have been sending.  It will go to Nesheim and you will hear from me again in a week or so when I am back from Washington.\nSincerely,   NHP\nhandwritten below typescript\nDear Jack -\nAfter you have read underlined:  A Return to Pagany I underlined:  would be interested in  hearing from you what you think of the book, a book which Granville Hicks so haughtily dismissed by outright expression of contempt along with a certain amount of left-handed recognition.

He prefaced each poem with an explanation of how he happened to write it.\nThe McMurray audience was very  interested in Macleod's close friendships with the great literary figures of the 1930's, including Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams. He discussed that writing era with them. \nMcMurray students asked many questions of Maclead, who has been described by his former teacher, Dr. George St. Clair, in the New Mexico Quarterly as follows: \"I remember Norman Macleod as one of my very brilliant students, and I remember also the verse he wrote in those days. That verse, I thought, was strong, full of energy, had and intellectual. It still retains its energetic and intellectual qualities, but it has softened, too, and now there is definitely beauty in it...a work of genius.\"\nMacleod's first novel. \"You Get What You Ask For,\" was published in 1939 by Harrison Hilton. It has an international background and concerns WPA days. His second novel, \"Bitter Roots,\" was published by Smith and Durrell in 1941 and concerns Montana youth during World War I.\nMcleod, who has traveled all over the world, received his B.A. from the University of New Mexico and his M.A. from Teachers College of Columbia University. His specialty at Pembroke State is creative writing. It is one of the most popular courses at this school- and the snowy-haired professor has quite a following. \nphoto--image\nNORMAN McLEOD\nA note to Jack Conroy from Norma Macleod Dec 31, 1969\nDear Jack-\nI thought you might like to have the copy of the letter from Norman Holmes Pearson- The Xeroxed letter attached hereto- in which Norman recalls his memories of you-\nBest always, Jack-\nNorman","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":144782,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/144782","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/64b7f611f36e0b0d98f77b5a40a8e016.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/64b7f611f36e0b0d98f77b5a40a8e016.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/64b7f611f36e0b0d98f77b5a40a8e016.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/64b7f611f36e0b0d98f77b5a40a8e016.jpg"},"added":"2023-04-04T19:48:44+00:00","modified":"2023-06-22T19:02:27+00:00","filename":"64b7f611f36e0b0d98f77b5a40a8e016.jpg","authentication":"942c3842dbd691223f64c36a3123c2ea","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"992006198805867_midwest_ms_conroy_box_00093_fl_03003_000093.jpg","size":217346,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":802,"resolution_y":1200,"compression_ratio":0.0752791632031033497440830615232698619365692138671875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00093], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00093], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00093], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1639,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1639","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"A letter to Norman Macleod from Norman Holmes Pearson # Note- December 29, 1969\nDear Norman- I haven't written as yet the whole story for you of Bob's visit (with me & Catherine Macleod) at the house of Hal Bynner in Santa Fe.

I was most grateful for your present to me of a copy of the manuscript \"Family of Flying Apart\" which I have read with great pleasure and appreciation. I am sending it along to Nesheim so that it will be safe with all of its important annotation along the margins. This has some very good poems in it of which you can take pride. Many of them certainly will be in the collected volume that you will one day have. But more than this promise, the manuscript contains good evidence of my conviction that you are ready to begin writing poems again. You say that poems cannot be written in haste. Or under pressure. We all know that, but when a poem becomes the focus of attention there are moments when one can go toward the line, toward the figure of speech, and toward the strategy of the whole. I don't know how much you ever tried reworking your manuscripts in various drives--each poet has his own method of composition--but you are always so good an editor for other people that I imagine you must be able to edit yourself. Try it anyhow. When I am gone,\nto Japan- note by [[NM?] Dec 29, 1969\nand it will be impossible for you to send your regular notes and annotations to me, you can write me. as it were, in poems. Since I am the Norman on the other side of our coin, the collection of poems can be your letter to me (which is to say, to yourself).\nKris Hotvedt sent along your annotated copies of my letters to you, so thank her when you write her. These are good ones to have in the collection. I don't mean my letters to you of course but what you have so valuably written in the margins. Equally valuable are the letters between you and McMurray College in Abilene. I had not actually realized that you were giving a reading but had suspected it would be reminiscence of the thirties. However I am sure they were pleased to have you there. Mr. Ackley had written me to say you were going. He sounded like a very good guy,\nNote- I also talked about the thirties0 as much as the traffic would bear out there.\nI was much interested in Jack Conroy's reference to me. I do indeed remember him well. Actually we met on several occasions on that particular visit of mine to Chicago and wrote for some time after. He gave me some stationery with the heading of \"Mortuary Research Association\" which I used for some time, and which Dudley Fitts had copied to use in reference to his own reviewing. I like too your story of taking Bob McAlmon to Hal Bynner's. Bob could be charming beyond words at one moment and difficult beyond words at another. I am glad that this was one of his good times. I see later in the same batch that the poems you have been publishing were finished earlier; this doesn't change my mind at all in believing that there are poems that you can do now. I am pleased to think that your letters will still addressed to me as your \"conscience\"; your poems can be written to your \"conscience\" also. Your son's letters are excellent. You are lucky to be able to have him in verse so easily with you, and so willingly.\nThank you for accepting the Christmas gift in the very spirit in which it was intended. I am sorry it could not be more.\n-see next page-","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":144783,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/144783","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3121accea06f8003ed71bd87932b3884.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3121accea06f8003ed71bd87932b3884.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3121accea06f8003ed71bd87932b3884.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3121accea06f8003ed71bd87932b3884.jpg"},"added":"2023-04-04T19:48:44+00:00","modified":"2023-06-22T19:16:11+00:00","filename":"3121accea06f8003ed71bd87932b3884.jpg","authentication":"b6097e9596bf5bf08a397bf0c9eefe62","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"992006198805867_midwest_ms_conroy_box_00093_fl_03003_000094.jpg","size":180481,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":801,"resolution_y":1200,"compression_ratio":0.06258877791649326838285816165807773359119892120361328125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00093], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00093], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00093], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1639,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1639","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"-2-\nThe extra $300 raise given me at Pembroke State University after my return from Abilene.\nNM\nThe raise in salary was a kind of end-of-year present.

He was running some sort of film exchange or something of the sort in Paris. Shortly thereafter I heard he had died a suicide--whether in New York or Paris I don't recall. Herbert changed the spelling on his name to Kline. He is listed in Leslies Halliwell's THE FILMGOER'S COMPANION (Hill and Wang, 1967) as being born in 1909 and described as \"American director, mainly of documentaries. Features include THE FORGOTTEN VILLAGE (also produced) 1951, and THE FIGHTER (1952).\" That's an interesting anecdote about Hemingway and Herb. A good episode for your autobiography.\nSad about Bob Lorenz. I had been in fairly close touch with him for a number of years. Used to stay in his pad when in NYC.

In my opinion, Hicks' review was that of a sour, cynical old man. Actually, the supercilious tone of condescension affected by Hicks made me rather hot under the collar- \nYou come out rather nicely + favorably and importantly in the book itself, a book which made me rather nostalgic about the past. That Jay du Von became a stool pigeon + informer does not surprise me, although I had not known this until you informed of the fact in this letter of yours. I always liked George Redfield the best of all the editors of underined: The Left.  I used to love to drink beer with George in much the same way I enjoyed being with Walt Carmon. One of the last times I saw George, he told me about a visit by an F.B.I. agent, who flashed his F.B.I. card in George's face, pushed his way into the apartment, + sat down without his having been asked to do so.\nover\nthe office. He was sales manager of some outfit. Then he got evangelical about some outfit that would organize the mayors of cities for social purposes--anti-war, etc. My Christmas card to him up in Vermont was not returned last year, though he did not reciprocate as of yore. So he must have died within the year. W.K. (\"Bill\") Jordan was or is living at 205 Swan Road, Suitland, Maryland--in government service of some kind. Did you know Jay du Von turned out to be a stool pigeon and government informer, fingering many of his former friends of the Left for the Un-American Committee and the FBI? I talked to Bill from New York about 15 years ago (George Redfield, not yet disappeared) got him on the phone and invited him to a party they were giving for me in NYC. Bill was cordial, but said he couldn't make it. I wrote him later, but he never answered. Joseph A. Kalar became public relations man for a lumber company--somewhat cynical about his \"red\" past. Last address was 4915 Nicollet Ave., Minneapolis, Minnesota 55409. I have talked to him on the phone (in Chicago) but never did meet him face to face. He's not reactionary--just indifferent.\n\n  Remember good old H. H. Lewis who used to give the CP hierarchy hell from Cape Girardeau, Missouri? I did a piece on him for the current issue of DECEMBER (Curt Johnson, editor, Box 274, Western Springs, Illinois 60558). Does the Pembroke library take it? They ought to. You might exchange your poetry magazine for his big magazine, sells for $2.50, but has a helluva lot in it.\n\nThanks for the photo negative.

My silence has been due only to trying to be as little at the office as I can. In other words my silence is really due to the attempt to follow your own instructions. But I am getting stronger all the time and before long it will only be a historic episode. \nIt was certainly kind of Paul Engel and Mr. Barr to send the xeroxing to you. I hope that you kept copies for your own records although they may not be things which you necessarily want to include in your collected works. Still for the scholar it will be valuable. Actually however there can't be any high school periodicals that have been able to print things as good as yours. There was a real style to them even then. I am thinking particularly of the prose, but the prize poem was a good one too.\nI didn't like the prize poem but one of the others I thought not too bad as an exchange? of un-informed unclear can't unclear NM\nThat was a first rate letter you wrote to Kurt Wetzel about William F. Dunne. \nNote- Wild Bill Dunne- leader of the strike of Butte Mines? in Montana? during WWI\nPeople will certainly be grateful for the chance to get copies of a letter like this. Your envelope with the review by Granny Hicks was welcome. I certainly don't think he got at the idea of what was behind Pagany, but on the other hand Hicks has turned into such a conservative that he has carried this into every corner. I have by the way ordered another copy of A Return to Pagany from the Beacon Press sent directly to you at Pembroke. This will really save time as against having it sent here and resent on to you to inscribe to your mother for Christmas. I was much taken with the content of Richard Johns' book although the writing of it seemed to me to be a little stodgy at times. But what it contains is invaluable and for that reason I am sending a copy to Horace Gregory for his Christmas. \nMy how your college notes carries one back to the twenties! I did enjoy reading them and they have set my mind running back over its own path. I may have come from the East, but I was a small town boy before I went off to school. It was only a few blocks from my door to the open woods, and we usually headed in that direction. The sophistication I picked up at Andover and Yale really is nothing but lacquer painted over very ordinary pine wood\nPerhaps I sent the xeroxed material to Neshaim- the unclear of stuff I wrote for the U. of Iowa humor magazine, Frivol- I don't remember. \nI am not quite sure when your visit to Texas takes place, although you certainly have told me specifically enough. But I do hope all goes well. I should have no fears about Skye. She is certainly devoted to you but I imagine would like nothing better than a chance to be on her own for a few days. Your Professor Wolf sounds like an excellent person and I know what fine men the Norwegian resistance fighters were. If you tell him that the Norwegians made me a Knight of St. Olaf he will know that I know. Since this letter was in the same issue with the announcement of your poems in the \"Southern Poetry Review\" I can say once again how much I liked them but even more so how pleased I am that you are writing your poems again. There is really no reason why you should not.

Norman Dec 8, 1969\n-2-\nThink that despite being fatigued and weighed down by your responsibility in terms of the children, there has been a period when you lost confidence in yourself as a creative man. Now you are seeing that this has never really been true but only that you have let your muscles slacken a little. If for no better reason think that you are writing some as least of these poems for me. It would give me enormous satisfaction to see you reassert yourself as a writer. I know it would do the same for both of your children. \nP.S. I hate to disillusion you, but the poems that are now beginning to be published underlined: are formerly unpublished poems written 1954-55, poems that were rejected by almost every publication in the country. Henry Rags, editor of underlined: Poetry (Chicago), however, did publish two of the poems written at that time- \"Occasional Intelligence by Radar\" + \"Lament\"- the latter being about my first wife and my first daughter Jocelyn (Joy) Macleod (Harris). They appeared in underlined:  Poetry for December 1957. I have a one track mind- when I am really writing, I am the writer all the time, I think and feel writing 24 hours a day. When I am teaching much the same thing happens, although I have written occasional poems while teaching during past years.

Alas! Alas! The pigeon in the grass, etc,\nIn a letter I opened later, out of sequence, I saw that you had indeed given me permission to send you the copy of underlined:  A Return to Pagany. Thank you for doing so. Sometimes my days get so balled up that I keep a little pile of your letters and open and read them when I can, as it were, have an hour with you.\nMy last letter in this particular batch was to you from Jere Mangione. His reminiscences of Kenneth Burke and Jack Conroy were particularly interesting to me. It has been some time since I saw Louise Bogan. She had had a nervous breakdown, I understand, a year or so ago, and is slowly recovering from it. If she does not answer it will be because of lack of strength on her part. \nDon't let my silence ever seem to be indifference.

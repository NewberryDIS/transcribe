Under standard conditions, the drop\ncontaining whatever steroids were present in the extract, is allowed\nto travel along the moist paper, which is hung in a special\nchamber for a given number of hours.  The rate of travel serves\nto separate each hormone and by developing the strip, it is\npossible to see the size of the spots made by the various\nhormones in a pure state, and the spots can even be quantitively\nremoved and measured.  The whole thing is very ingenious, but\nit was terribly tedious and cumbersome, and far from reliable even\nwhen I used to move through the whole process alone.  There are too\nmany steps, and each step has its weak point.  And when the technique\nwas first used, it worked out fairly well for cortisone and for \nhydrocortisone, but aldosterone, present in much smaller amounts,\nfailed to show up with the same pair of solvents, hence its relationship\nto the others - particularly, cortisone and  hydrocortisone  - remained\na little vague.  So, on the occasion of the meeting that I've referred\nto, and the paper on the aldosterone secreting [?], the flush of my\nfirst admiration faded suddenly when it occured to me to wonder if\nit was actually true.   I remembered that the leader of the two\nresearch groups were good friends and that the pressure from the medical\nschools and from the sources of federal grants-in-aid is\nvery great.   It's produce, or else lose your grant.  On the other\nhand, there are so many highly-specialized techniques that almost\nno group is able to asses the contributions of another,  hence the\nultimate analysis, to declare them \"reproducible\" or \"not reproducible\"\nor, in simple English, true or false.

Some of the descriptions operated, not negatively but affirmatively,\nand some  [crossed out:  poor] God-forsaken creature was exalted by something\nabout the disease or condition, the the number one patient in the\nhospital.  One of the most picturesque of these was Mrs. X, who came to\nthe clinic because of dim vision.  It turned out that she saw dimly\nbecause she was suffering from such a catastrophic anemia that\nher life itself was dim.  And the cause of the anemia was not long\nin making its appearance - in fact, the admitting nurse could have\nestablished the diagnosis.  Mrs. X had, in fact, one of the largest fibroid\ntumors ever seen in our hospital, and still she accepted her existence as  a\nkind of loose [?cortex?] ^'of which' around that great pumpkin and came for medical attention\nonly when she thought she needed glasses and ought to get them cheaper\nthrough the clinic!  Well, the gynecology service was galvanized into\nthe most passionate participation.  Blood donors were called for and typed;\nthe two most famous surgeons worked together to remove the tumor; every\ncomplication was foreseen and forestalled.  As the intern on the service\nI struggled night and day for the life of Mrs. X, who certainly didn't\nknow the difference and without whom the world wouldn't have been\nmuch the worse.  Finally, around the end of the first post-operative week,\nI was working in the interns' laboratory one evening when I became aware\nthat someone was standing in the doorway.

Many procedures could never have been developed\nif the surgeon had not enjoyed, not only the clinical facilities\n- which is to say, access to larger numbers of patients - but\nthe immunity conferred by the clinic system.  By this I mean that\nthe surgeon is on a salary from the clinic and it is not directly \npaid by the patient.  This means that the senior surgeon can\noffer necessary training to his resident or his fellow by allowing\nhim to perform the surgery, whether the patient likes it or not.\nThis is important because the resident or the surgical fellow\nhas to have the opportunity to do surgery, not just scrub up\nand stand at the table holding a retractor while the chief removes\nthe gallbladder or resects the stomach.  It is also important\nfor the development of surgery, that just as the patient pays\nthe clinic and not the doctor, by the same token it is the\ncorporate group and not the surgeon that he would sue if\nhe were to decide that he had been mistreated.  Potential\nmalpractice suits are a powerful restraint and many operations\nwould never have been worked out if the inventor had not had the\nprotective situation of the clinic to support the innovation.  This is\nof course not the reason why some people prefer a clinic to a private\nsurgeon.  They simply think that a well-known clinic will have only\nthe most highly skilled surgeons on its staff.

Then there\nis the technical part to be learned, the cutting and staining of sections of\ntissues and the mounting of slides.\n\n   It was about at this time that I had one of the great experiences\n\nof my medical education, although I recently checked with my embryology\nprofessor and discovered that the experience must have been in part\nhallucinatory.  It had to do with the origin of pulsation in the developing\ncardio-vascular system.   You may know, Inspector, that the foetal blood vessels\nform on the yolk of the fertilized ovum and that they branch and grow\nuntil, at the site of the future heart, the primitive vessels [?] together, clasp, \nfuse, to form the right and left sides of the heart.   These in turn modify and\nbreak through to become the four chambered heart of man, two auricles\nand two ventricles.   There the blood is sent into the lungs by the right ventricle \nand is returned, oxygenated, to the left ventricle from which it passes into\nthe left ventricle and out to the periphery through the aorta returning\nto the right auricle it goes back to the right ventricle to repeat the \noxygenation process.  But note that all of this stems from the activity of\na few cells which function as the \"pace-maker,\" the instigator of the\ncardiac construction.  All this multiplication and differentiation of embryonal\ncells,  all this [?] tingling of developing life has gone on, up\nto a certain point, like vegetative growth, complicated but [?] so\nto speak, a mute destiny locked within its chromosomes.  And then, at\nthat magic, that mysterious moment, those interlocking embryonal blood\nvessels must twitch, tremble in their strange, gelatinous developing.  Yes,\nInspector, they must flicker feebly as they are caught up in their great\nfuture.  And there it must be like the first chiming of a great bell, but\nintense, divine.   And he twitching becomes regular, rhythmic, and\nsoon the whole new organism has become [?], permeated with \nthe gift of pulsation, and a new human has come into being.\n\n   I don't remember how this was demonstrated to  us, but however it\n\nwas presented, the diagrams, slides, words - it kindled my imagination\nwith the same pulsation and I have never forgotten it.

From then\non, even though he never hears any more about colitis, he is likely\nto feel that he should \"be careful\" because of \"my colitis.\"  He will","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":120794,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/120794","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/72bfe866c33d2985d5339edace278866.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/72bfe866c33d2985d5339edace278866.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/72bfe866c33d2985d5339edace278866.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/72bfe866c33d2985d5339edace278866.jpg"},"added":"2021-06-15T01:37:11+00:00","modified":"2021-08-21T01:08:53+00:00","filename":"72bfe866c33d2985d5339edace278866.jpg","authentication":"65c032a1e2964d45fb1c48ebc7e8a8a4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_farnsworth_box_1_fl_23_045_o2.jpg","size":1478871,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2558,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0535310789679437071253431668083067052066326141357421875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"ObjectName":["Works-I Make Folk-Songs Without a Folk"],"DateCreated":["20160412"],"TimeCreated":["225125"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Chicago and the Midwest (Newberr"],"Credit":["https:\/\/i-share.carli.illinois.e"],"Source":["Midwest MS Farnsworth Box 1 Fold"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"ObjectName":["Works-I Make Folk-Songs Without a Folk"],"DateCreated":["20160412"],"TimeCreated":["225125"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Chicago and the Midwest (Newberr"],"Credit":["https:\/\/i-share.carli.illinois.e"],"Source":["Midwest MS Farnsworth Box 1 Fold"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"ObjectName":["Works-I Make Folk-Songs Without a Folk"],"DateCreated":["20160412"],"TimeCreated":["225125"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Chicago and the Midwest (Newberr"],"Credit":["https:\/\/i-share.carli.illinois.e"],"Source":["Midwest MS Farnsworth Box 1 Fold"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1397,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1397","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"45\nenjoy his meals quite as much because now he has a mystic impairment,\nand it's up to him to heed the warning.

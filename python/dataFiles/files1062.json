April 23.d 1837.\nJohn Howard Payne Esq. \nDear Sir, \nYour favour of April 7th. 1836, was only received, and my wish was to have answered it immediately - the intention to neglect it was ever, for one moment, meditated.  but you know enough of me to be satisfied that I cannot write about nothing - cannot find leisure for mere quipping?.  Your suggestions and your inquiries of me about our Indians were to me very interesting.  I have been seeking knowledge on the subject for years.  I have obtained some, but I desire much more.  Neither my own, nor other man's speculations can satisfy me for a moment.  That which I have, however, is interesting and you shall have it, after I advert to your Georgia disasters, and some other matters.  When I learned the fate of your laudable and only commendable enterprise in Georgia, I felt much regret, but no surprise.  You are correct in saying that I admonish you of what you might expect, and if you ever publish your travels you ought to state the fact and the source of my suspicions.  I think it almost impossible that I can be deceived in my estimate of a people if I can once dine at a public table among them.  I have been importuned to visit the interior of Georgia.  I have not yet done so, and if I were to it will be with slender expectations of either enjoyment or profit.  But if I should go and be agreeably disappointed I will do them justice.  Intelligent gentlemen assure me that I ? be pleased.  We have tough times here in the business world but not worse than I anticipated two years since.  I warned the people in New Orleans and in this place, from the pulpit two years since.  I told them that these difficulties were coming.  I named the causes and gave their modus operandi upon the mind?.  I was laughed at and told that it was impossible.  Some of my friends whom I advised on the subject re...ed? so deeply in speculation that they were crushed to atoms.  The man who understands the human mind and the action of influencing causes may speak a prophetically warning voice.  Alas! while reason governs wise men nothing less than punishment will govern fools.  Be pleased to accept my thanks for the flattering notice you gave of my introductory lecture in the N. Y. Mirror.  I am married and married to please myself.  I think that you wanto? be pleased with my choice.  Perhaps you will see my wife in the course of a year, as I propose visiting N. Y..  I am still a traveller and likely to continue so for some time.  I have so established Phrenology in the South that it yields me about $10,000 a year.  Bigotry is still against me, however, but I go ahead.  I will visit again, before many weeks, the Creek nation {crossed out} country.  The Indians have moved, hence I can procure as many crania as I want with care and personal safety.  Smith is in Clinton Miss. and making money, but not saving it.  I have not seen him since last summer.  I have but little hope that he will even take a manly stand in society.  I have done my best to exert over him a proper influence.  I can do no more.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71921,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71921","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/cb7d5bc07dc07b3c6643c52a0ad6d370.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/cb7d5bc07dc07b3c6643c52a0ad6d370.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/cb7d5bc07dc07b3c6643c52a0ad6d370.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cb7d5bc07dc07b3c6643c52a0ad6d370.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:02:51+00:00","modified":"2020-08-16T01:48:54+00:00","filename":"cb7d5bc07dc07b3c6643c52a0ad6d370.jpg","authentication":"995ac0a61832a14b5f5892fac43ca6ed","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":134,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL10_FL005_00002_o2.jpg","size":1482156,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2293,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05985026893443799733685040109776309691369533538818359375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073436+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073436+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073436+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cb7d5bc07dc07b3c6643c52a0ad6d370.jpg","FileDateTime":1522681366,"FileSize":1482156,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2293\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2293,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Windows","DateTime":"2013:04:12 08:45:03","Exif_IFD_Pointer":150},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:21 07:34:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:21 07:34:36","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":33,"SubSecTimeDigitized":33,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2941,"ExifImageLength":4617,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1062,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1062","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Now for the Indians\nThat are of the Indians on this continent are of Asiatic origin. I have scarcely a doubt. I saw an Asiatic in the hospital at N. Orleans who so much resembled our Indians that he could have passed for ours in any part of our country. But I doubt the propriety as well as yourself, of supposing that there was but one emigration. I am, however, disposed to believe that all of the emigrations were through Behring's Strait - that all of them travelled southwest between the rocky mountains and the sea coast to Mexico and thence into the United States. From Humbolt we learn that four distinct emigrations were made into Mexico. viz: The Zoltecs - the Chichimecas - the Nahuatlacs and the Alcalhuans. I have no doubt but that there has been seven or eight emigrations into this country - but in consequence of my ignorance of the Northern Indian I can only distinguish five. In doing this I include all the Northern tribes in the first emigration, those who erected mounds, which I call the monumental, in the second; the Lechees, Souonokos, Shawnees Yamapas and Catabas in the third; the Hitchetus and Seminoles in the fourth and the fifth comprises the Chickasaws, Choctaws, Creeks & Cherokees. I cannot make it certain that this was the order of the emigrations, but if I had more time than I have to devote to the subject, I could make it very probable. That all of these tribes, except the monumental, had the same remote origin can hardly be doubted after an examination of their strong personal resemblance. The monumental may possibly be included, not having seen any of them I cannot decide. But that they were Asiatic can be made very probable.\n\nI do not intend to make any remarks upon the Northern Indians - I have given them but little attention. But to the Monumental I have been for years devoted, and to very little advantage til recently.  My difficulty existed in the fact that I could uncover no starting point from which to prosecute the enquiry. I could not connect them with any people that is known in the history of the species. My difficulty has disappeared - I have established by observation a starting point - I have discovered a position from which we can contemplate them with interest.\nI am now prepared to show that the Natchez Indians - the Attackapas, the Chinooks (at the mouth of the Columbia river and western slope of the rocky mountains) the Chichimicas and probably the Toltecs of Mexico, the Peruvians, the Hispaniolians, and the Monumentals of America were all the same people, no matter whence they originated. I regret that I have not the leisure to give you all the evidence I have  obtained on this subject. That which I have observed I will briefly give you. On the farm of Col. Bingiman, two and a half miles from Natchez, Mis. in a slight elevation of earth, called a Mound and regarded as artificial by those who live in the vicinity of it, but I could not so regard it. I disccovered four skeletons which I consider to be of the Natchez Indians. They were extended at full length, the right arm extended by the side and the left hand placed across the breast. French beads, buttons, and glass, brass and iron rings, with some of their own Wampum beads and pottery, of a good finish, also pipes, made of red stiatite, were found with them. From these skeletons I obtained two crania so well preserved as to admit","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71922,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71922","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8b70447bb9cea38bf813a91bb3aa192d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8b70447bb9cea38bf813a91bb3aa192d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8b70447bb9cea38bf813a91bb3aa192d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8b70447bb9cea38bf813a91bb3aa192d.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:02:52+00:00","modified":"2020-08-16T02:05:08+00:00","filename":"8b70447bb9cea38bf813a91bb3aa192d.jpg","authentication":"4fd46f22306ef307938720aebdfc9d96","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":135,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL10_FL005_00003_o2.jpg","size":1433536,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2258,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058784240396285998564440689051480148918926715850830078125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073436+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073436+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073436+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8b70447bb9cea38bf813a91bb3aa192d.jpg","FileDateTime":1522681366,"FileSize":1433536,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2258\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2258,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Windows","DateTime":"2013:04:12 08:44:36","Exif_IFD_Pointer":150},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:21 07:34:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:21 07:34:36","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":33,"SubSecTimeDigitized":33,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2897,"ExifImageLength":4617,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1062,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1062","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"of being removed and preserved. As no positive or historical evidence can be had that these are Natchez crania, I will state the facts from which I infer that they are. The only people known to have been in the country since the French took possession of it are Europeans, Choctaws, Negros and Natchez Indians. The form of these crania clearly determines that they are neither of the first three, and that they represent one of the four is evident from the fact that they were buried with European Ornaments. The form of these crania is unlike that of any tribe of the human race now known, except the Chinooks. They are very much compressed in their occipito-frontal diameter, so much so as to measure but four inches, while, from ear to ear, they measure six.  There can be no doubt but that they were thus deformed during infancy by one compress being applied to the occipital and another to the frontal bone of the head.\n\n    Having satisfied myself that the Natchez Indians had flat heads, and recollecting that I found flat heads in the Mounds of Virginia  I could not resist the conclusion that the Natchez and Monumentals were the same people. But to make the matter more certain I proceeded to examine the Mounds in Miss.  On a plantation four miles above Vicksburg, there are five mounds so arranged as to constitute a circle, one of them is very much larger than the others. The smallest one is situated a little without the circle and it is the only one that was appropriated to Sepulchral purposes. I found many crania in this Mound and succeeded in finding one so well preserved as to admit of being removed without injury.  It is precisely like the Natchez head. Fourteen miles from Vicksburg on the Yazoo river are eight mounds, six of them are so arranged as to form a circle. One of them is very large, but neither of these contain any bones. The other two are some distance from the circle and are filled with human bones. From one of them I disinterred a great number of crania, but obtained only three in such a state of preservation as to admit of being removed without falling into fragments. Two of these were flattened precisely like those above described, the third was less compressed.   With these heads I found French beads, and history informs us (but the fact is not generally known) that the French built a fort at this place, and also a church, which was called St. Peter's. The soldiers of the Fort as at Natchez were massacred by the Indians. That these Indians were the same as the Natchez  cannot now be doubted. Hence it is clear that the Monumental Indians and the Natchez were the same people.\n   The fashion of cranial compression vs. deformity was not extended to the females, for the female crania of these mounds have the natural configuration; but they are very unlike the female crania of the present tribes - they are more beautiful and have a less savage aspect. They resemble very clearly a female head which I have from the Temple of the sun near Lima in Peru, in which no interments have been made since the Conquest of Pizaro. It is interesting to remark that the female crania, so for as regards the structure of the bones, are better preserved than the male. The cranial bones of the female are thin and dense - the male are thick and spongy, but have the sutures more complete, which seems to have resutured from the influence exerted upon the opific pricep by the compression.

The artificial pressure used upon the male heads lessened the activity of the brain which caused a thickening of the skull as in cases of fatuity produced by injuries inflicted on the head, or other causes. This difference does not obtain between the cranial bones of the sexes of any living tribes of Indians. The bones of each are dense and thin. These flat headed Indians, or Monumental, were, intellectually, a feeble or simple people. This is clearly to be inferred from their thick skulls. They were constructive, cautious, vain, religious and cunning. This being their condition, they became an easy prey to more war-like predacious tribes - hence their, almost, entire extermination.\n\n   From the preceding facts I come to the following conclusions with regard to the tribe of people who erected mounds and flattened their heads. \n\n1 The Natchez Indians were only a Town or clan of the Monumental people, or those who erected mounds over much of this country. \n2 The Attackapas of La. was another clan of the same people, for their heads are compressed in a similar manner.\n3. The Peruvians erected mounds and worshiped the Sun - so did the Natchez - Dr. Mitchel's Medical Depository, Vol. II.\n4 The Chechimecas erected Mounds and worshiped the sun, also. The sepulchral position of the dead in the mounds of Virginia precisely resemble specimens of the Chichimecas sculpture. Bullocks Mexico.\n5 The great analogy that has been found to exist between the astronomical systems of the Chichimecas & Asiatics, indicate the same people.\n6 The Chinooks are the living representatives of this Monumental people and still practice many of their peculiarities.\n7 This monumental people was agricultural and not fond of war or the chase. This position is sustained by the fact that their monuments are planted upon the most fertile planes and vallies in our country - their sepulchral repositories show that they were given to permanent habitation. No war-like or hunting implements are found about their remains or habitations, except occasionally, and those instances are to be attributed to the tribes which by accident or war took possession of the same place. Their mounds were not intended for war-like offence or defense, but for dwelling places to the chiefs and amusements. Sometimes, instead of several mounds forming a circle there are four embankments forming a square, or else  a circular embankment. These were chiefly intended for observations for witnessing the amusements or religious ceremonies, which were being performed in the inclosure. You and I saw the same on a small scale among the Creeks.\n\n    The most distinct Indian emigration in the order I have named them consists of the Uchus, Sanonkos, Catabas and Shawnees, of South Carolina and Georgia. I have seen the Uchus - their language is gutteral and so peculiarly difficult to acquire, that it is said that no one ever did acquire it without having been brought up with them from infancy.\n    The fourth distinct emigration comprises the Hitchitus and Seminoles of Alabama and Florida. I have seen some of these Indians and have some of their crania. I regard them as the most gifted Indians in America. They furnish a positive contradiction to an opinion that has become very prevalent, viz. that the South cannot produce talented and great men.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71924,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71924","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5f1e7d5561c5626714685fa0d871c7c6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5f1e7d5561c5626714685fa0d871c7c6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5f1e7d5561c5626714685fa0d871c7c6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5f1e7d5561c5626714685fa0d871c7c6.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:02:54+00:00","modified":"2020-08-16T03:31:37+00:00","filename":"5f1e7d5561c5626714685fa0d871c7c6.jpg","authentication":"69ead75958bec63a584b2b5ce636c7b4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":137,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL10_FL005_00005_o2.jpg","size":1501691,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2284,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.060878048582732997850985867671624873764812946319580078125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073531+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073531+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073531+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5f1e7d5561c5626714685fa0d871c7c6.jpg","FileDateTime":1522681366,"FileSize":1501691,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2284\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2284,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Windows","DateTime":"2013:04:12 08:33:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":150},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:21 07:35:31","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:21 07:35:31","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":97,"SubSecTimeDigitized":97,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2920,"ExifImageLength":4601,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1062,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1062","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"5\/ I know nothing of the order of emigration or to time, that obtained with the above name tribes; but with regard to the fifth, the Chickasaws, Choctaws, Creeks and Cherokees, we have evidence that it was the last.  The traditions of these Indians as obtained by Colo. Hawkins, and of the Choctaws as obtained by W. Vose of Natchez, are quite satisfactory upon this point.  The following letter from Genl. Goor you will regard as valuable in reference to the Southern Indians.  \nHills April 2nd  I835.   Dear Sir, In the month of February 1810 I was detained by bad weather at the house of Colo. Benjamin Hawkins who was then and had been agent for the Creek Indians from the time of Genl. Washington's Presidency.  In the course of conversation he spoke of having been at considerable trouble in collecting from the most intelligent Indians of the four nations viz: Chickasaws, Choctaws, Cherokees and Creeks, the traditionary history of their people - which he had embodied in a manuscript, but would not permit it to be published during his life.  He died sometime in the spring of 1815, and his house (the agency) taking fire soon after, his papers were all consumed.  \nI will now give you as near as my memory will serve me his summary of the traditions he had received.\nMany ages since our people resided in a country far west of the great river Mississippi.  They war'd many years with a people more powerful than themselves.  Beaten past hope, they retreated to the rising sun with a view of crossing the Mississippi and placing that great water between themselves and their foes.  The first attempt was to cross at the Natchez bluffs but were beaten back by the people inhabiting the country on the opposite side.  Th[eir] old enemies being close in pursuit they retreated up the west side of the river to opposite the Chickasaw bluffs where they succeeded in crossing and were at length safe from pursuit.  They then jointly made war on the people inhabiting the country, now in the possession of the Chickasaws and Choctaws whom they exterminated from the open country, but were repulsed whenever they attempted to enter the thick cane.  Here the Chickasaws & Choctaws settled themselves.  The Cherokees pursued their conquests in the mountains against the shawnese Indians, while the Creeks pushed their conquests towards the sea & eastwardly.  They exterminated the Uchus, inhabiting the Chattahochee river excepting a small band which would not fight, these they enslaved (and still reside on the Uchee Creek not far from the present town of Columbus in Georgia) they still pressed their conquests eastwardly and utterly destroyed the Yamasses living on the Okofonoko swamp and st. Mary's river and were carrying on war with the Catabas beyond the Savanna river when ships appeared in the bay, where Charleston now stands, with the first British colony.  They then made a treaty with the whites and have ever since held themselves the allies of the people of S. Carolina.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71925,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71925","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/2f75f1000246e6454b7c179b4980c889.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/2f75f1000246e6454b7c179b4980c889.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/2f75f1000246e6454b7c179b4980c889.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2f75f1000246e6454b7c179b4980c889.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:02:55+00:00","modified":"2020-08-16T03:41:21+00:00","filename":"2f75f1000246e6454b7c179b4980c889.jpg","authentication":"771f91298ba450e26b80811d53687c6b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":138,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL10_FL005_00006_o2.jpg","size":1412014,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2274,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057494299488582999158037267761756083928048610687255859375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073616+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073616+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073616+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"2f75f1000246e6454b7c179b4980c889.jpg","FileDateTime":1522681366,"FileSize":1412014,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2274\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2274,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Windows","DateTime":"2013:04:12 08:35:14","Exif_IFD_Pointer":150},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:21 07:36:16","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:21 07:36:16","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":49,"SubSecTimeDigitized":49,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2909,"ExifImageLength":4604,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1062,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1062","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"6\/ The above is substancially as I received it from Colo. Hawkins whose impression was, from their story, that they were driven from their seats by a people expelled from Mexico by Cortez.  If the story I have given you will furnish any light on Indian history, to yourself or other lovers of antiquity, I shall be gratified, I am Dear Sir respectfully your Obt. servant  F. Love?\nDr. W. Byrd Powell, New Orleans.  I have now given you the outline of my Indian knowledge - were it requisite I could give many minutia about the southern tribes; also much historical matter.  \nI promised you some traditions of the Natchez Indians - you shall now have them. \n\n    The Choctaw tradition of the French massacre at Natchez  Miss. Communicated to John Fletcher Esq. of Natchez by Colo. Nail a Choctaw Chief.  The former imparted the same to me, in Natchez, March 1835.\n\nThe word Natchez signifies a knobby or hilly country, such as that inhabited by the Natchez tribe of Indians and which extended from the Slenville? to Chittalausa on the Miss. and back from ten to thirty miles. \nThe French made a location and built a fort at the place where Natchez City now stands or in its immediate vicinity, most probably at Ellis Cliffs, about ten miles south of Natchez.\nThe French were received kindly by the Natchez Indians and were much feared and respected by them in consequence of their fire arms and apparent wealth.  After a time the French taxed or required a tribute of these Indians of such things as the country produced, particularly of corn, peltry &c. At these, to them, unlawful and unjust requisitions they remonstrated time after time or till they became convinced that it was useless.  Being determined not to submit to such taxation, they solicited assistance from their neighbours, the Choctaws.  Agents were appointed by both nations to treat upon the subject which resulted in an agreement on the part of the Choctaws to render the desired aid, to exterminate the French, for the consideration of one half of the booty, for the French were regarded by both nations as being wealthy.\nConsiderable time was to elapse between the time of the treaty and the execution of it, and to prevent the possibility of a failure of a joint and simultaneous cooperation of both nations, a bundle of sticks was provided, for the Chief or each expressive of the number days that should elapse, from which one was to be drawn every day, and on the day after the drawing of the last the attack was to be made.

Accordingly they violated their treaty, and before the time on which the massacre was to have been consummated, and upon a time when they were to meet at the French garrison to pay the tribute that had been so unjustly required of them, and which they intended should serve as a pretext for their assemblage at the Fort, they, with one impulse, seized the knives, axes &c of the garrison, which, with their own instruments of wrath, they soon effected a complete and an entire massacre of their self constituted masters, and appropriated to themselves their plunder. \nAt the time stipulated by the treaty between them and the Choctaws, the latter appeared, but found the work completed in which they were to have participated.  In compliance with the treaty, however, they demanded half the plunder; but this was refused, and they immediately, to punish such a flagrant violation of Justice, declared war upon the Natchez nation.  The latter being highly elated and flattered by their recent success, and stimulated by a desire to retain the plunder, felt able to successfully defend themselves.  In this, they finally found themselves disappointed, and to prevent the entire destruction of their tribe, they precipitably left the country in the possession of their enemy, whither they went the Choctaws know not.\nNot long after this event, the Choctaws were visited by an embassy from the Tensas Indians*, a small tribe living at a place, now known as Lake Louis or Louiss's Lake which is one of the boundaries of Cicily Island in the parish of O. Cattahoola, {Louisiana,) informing them that the Natchez Tribe had settled in their country, and had become so troublesome that they had called upon them (the Choctaws) for assistance to drive them away.\nThe Choctaws, after taking the matter into consideration, declined.  They felt that they had sufficiently punished them for their perfidy, and that nothing could be gained by a further pursuit of them.\nHowever much the Tensas regretted the refusal of aid from the Choctaws, they made it a virtue of necessity to war with the intruding Natchez, which happened not to be for a long time, for other French troops, shortly after the massacre, re-took possession of the Natchez country.  To these the  Tensas tribe applied for assistance and did not apply in vain.  The French were anxious to revenge the unopposed slaughter of their friends and eagerly embraced this opportunity not to oblige the Tensas, but to satiate their revenge by a total destruction of those of the Natchez nation which had escaped from the Choctaws. \nWith the Tensas Indians as pilots they descended the Miss. to Red river, up it to Black river, up it to the mouth of Byou Louis, the outlet of Lake Louis, and up this as far as prudence or necessity required.

Those who were absent and consequently escaped destruction numbered about a hundred, twenty of whom were supposed to have retreated up Red river and joined the Cumanches, and the remainder sought a union with the Chickasaws who received them upon the condition they united with them and considered themselves as Chickasaws, and never more to use the name of their parent nation in relation to themselves.  To these conditions they acceded.  Shortly after, the French not satisfied with the massacre at Lake Louis of the great majority of the nation, pursued this remnant to the Chickasaw nation & demanded them, but fortunately, without success.  The Chickasaws informed them that they had no Natchez Indians amongst them - that those whom they demanded had now become Chickasaws and as such they would defend them.  The French, upon reflection prudently relinquished their sanguinary intentions, as contemplated against the Chickasaws, and returned to their fort near Natchez.  Thus, and thus only, were a remnant of the Natchez tribe of Indians spared to tell the story of their national destruction, which is a following:\nThe traditional history of the difficulties which ensued between the Natchez and Choctaw Indians after the massacre of the French at fort Natchez; communicated to me by W. John Hutchins of Natchez, who recieved it from his father Colo. Anthony Hutchins who obtained it from those of the Natchez Indians who escaped destruction at Lake Louis by the French.\nThe Natchez Indians deny having, knowingly and intentionally, violated their treaty with the Choctaws.  They state that the difficulties originated through the instrumentality of the daughter of the Natchez Chief.  She was in love with, and fancied herself beloved by a Frenchman of the garrison, and learning of the purpose of the treaty which had been made between her nation and the Choctaws, she feared that the object of her affections would be destroyed in the contemplated massacre; to defeat which, she drew several sticks from the bundle that had been provided her Father by the treaty to guide the movements of his nation. as to time, and thus caused her father to lead on his forces before the arrival of the Choctaws.  She calculated that her father would abandon the enterprise unless he met the Choctaws in readiness to assist him.\nContrary to her expectations as regarded the result, her father advanced upon the garrison, commenced and finished the destruction of the French without foreign aid.  Some days after the battle the Choctaws arrived.  The Natchez charged them with having violated their obligation.  The Choctaws on the contrary asserted that they were punctual to the time specified, and although they had not participated in the battle, yet, as they had appeared in time, according to the treaty, to render the promised assistance, they claimed half of the booty.\nThe Natchez, under the influence of a contrary opinion, refused to divide with them the treasure.  Each nation charged the other with dishonesty till finally, they went to war, the result of which was stated in the Choctaw narative.\nThe Natchez continued ignorant of the part which the chief's","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71928,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71928","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7c4c9ce257b43b15b00ca8d069b1bf46.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7c4c9ce257b43b15b00ca8d069b1bf46.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7c4c9ce257b43b15b00ca8d069b1bf46.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7c4c9ce257b43b15b00ca8d069b1bf46.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:02:58+00:00","modified":"2020-08-16T18:27:06+00:00","filename":"7c4c9ce257b43b15b00ca8d069b1bf46.jpg","authentication":"29563ea417429f31c2113838d1ddd741","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":141,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL10_FL005_00009_o2.jpg","size":1278244,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2276,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05200172492351799735654793721550959162414073944091796875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073916+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073916+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073916+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7c4c9ce257b43b15b00ca8d069b1bf46.jpg","FileDateTime":1522681366,"FileSize":1278244,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2276\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2276,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Windows","DateTime":"2013:04:12 08:31:49","Exif_IFD_Pointer":150},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:21 07:39:16","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:21 07:39:16","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":34,"SubSecTimeDigitized":34,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2921,"ExifImageLength":4619,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1062,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1062","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"9\ndaughter had acted in the tragedy till after the slaughter of her father and friends, when she communicated it.  As she had nothing left, (lover, father, friends, all gone,) to make life desirable to her, she went to a neighbouring lake and drowned herself.\nNote: - the time at which the massacre happened is not definitely known; some of the French writers say that is occured in 1717 others say 1727.- Dr. Cely informed John Fletcher Esq. of Natchez that he saw a Mrs. Blanch in 1824 who was 108 years old, she told him that her breasts had just commenced growing or making a swell in her bosom at the time of the battle.  If we suppose her to have been 11 years old at the time, then it must have happened in 1717.\nAs to the locality of the French fort, which is not precisely known, this woman stated that it was at a point, from which the river, both up and down, could be seen at one view, and the only place known that answers this description is the upper end of Ellis' Clifts.  With regard to the massacre, this woman knew of no one having escaped except herself.  She was not in the fort at the time, and as soon as hostilities commenced she ran down the bluff to the river and crossed it in a canoe and continued on the opposite shore till she found it convenient or safe to depart, when she floated down the river to Baton Rouge at which place there was a french settlement.\nTo communicate to you all that I designed in the outset I have been compelled to encroach upon a third sheet, and not wishing to make you pay postage on blank paper I will give you some other Indian matter which possibly you may find use for, at some time or other.\nWhile in Virginia I investigated the mounds as far as I....and made notes of what I discovered.  The mounds of V[irginia]...marked a border line, between the Atlantic people.....great western world; that is, the mounds do not approach nearer the Atlantic coast than the falls of the larger rivers.  The Mounds of Virginia are much older than any I have examined in the South.  This is evident from the less preserved condition of the bones which they contain.  Those who built them differed from those of the South in their sepullchral ceremonies.  Mr. Jefferson, in his notes, tells us that he examined a mound on the Rivanna river, and that the contained bones had evidently been thrown, confusedly, into a heap, as though they had been gathered from a battle field.  In support of this opinion he states that in several instances, discovered the foot bones within the cranium.  That Mr. Jefferson's opinions cannot always be relied upon will be seen presently.\nI examined a mound on the farm of Mr. Joel Watkins on the Appomattox river.  It had been six or seven times the subject of examination before by visit, and upon some occasions by intelligent gentlemen; nevertheless, nothing was discovered but bones in disorder and confusion.  Perhaps idle curiosity, a stimulus entirely insufficient for close and patient observation, impelled to the examination.

Upon descending, deeper, 14 inches I came to another stratum of bones which  were sufficiently sound to admit of being handled.  But I discovered no confusion - and it will be seen presently that Mr. Jefferson mistook order for confusion.\nThe high bones lay nearly parallel and pointed to the S.E. the leg bones lay between them and pointed to the N.W. the knee pans were found near the extremities which they had assisted to articulate the fore arm bones lay crossing the thigh bones at very accute angles, and the whole constituted almost a parallel bundle.  The arm bones were further in the rear and lay by the side, or over the hip bones; the under and upper Jaws in most instances, the astragalus and calcis, with neck bones in several instances, and in one the head of the thigh bones, were found within the Cranium. (It will be of course, understood that the base of the cranium had decayed off which admitted of the introduction of the other bones.) In every case the Sacrum was found between the hip bones, and generally under the cranium.  The rib and spinal bones lay in disorder under and around the head.  The crania were generally resting on their bases.  These facts show very clearly that the sepralchral attitude was the flexion of the legs upon the thighs - the body erect and the haunches resting on the heels.  This is the attitude of a Burmese Idol, and also that of some pieces of rude sculpture found in Mexico and attributed to the Checkimecas.  From the direction of the thigh bones in the above examinations it is evident that the face was to the S.E.  The settling of the Mound explains the introduction of foot bones into the cranium.  Such was unquestionably the case in Mr. Jefferson's Revanna Mound.  With each of the skeletons I examined, I found a small quantity of burnt or calcined bones, consisting of fragments of the Jaws, cranium and cylindrical bones, and occasionally small...and portions so calcined that their place could not be determined....I found in every instance burnt straw or grass of a large size.  About fourteen inches below this stratum of bones I found another, but no peculiarities except such as has been described.  The crania in all these instances were so mutilated by the pressure of the mound that I could not determine their form; but my recollection of the form of the Os frontes, satisfies me, since, I have seen the flat heads of the southern mounds, that they had also been flattened.  I examined another mound in Rockbridge Co. Va. and the facts were the same as those above named.  As regards the current bones, the dental sockets of the maxillary fragments are sufficient to show that they were not of children.  The facts which these examinations disclose are sufficient to produce a volume of the most interesting reflections.  Did a Hindoo custom, of destroying the wife at the death of the husband, prevail with this people?  I will refrain from enlarging on this subject till I have made more observations.  The more I reflect on this curious subject, the more do I feel its important connexion with the history of our country.  These Mounds and their contents are the only memorials which are now allowed inquisitive men for the satisfaction of a laudable curiosity in relation to the race that first peopled this extensive country.  These frail memorials like every thing earthy, are now fast hastening to a complete decay, -","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71930,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71930","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/365bd25f5f9cd7bb1f227c6520e61c44.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/365bd25f5f9cd7bb1f227c6520e61c44.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/365bd25f5f9cd7bb1f227c6520e61c44.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/365bd25f5f9cd7bb1f227c6520e61c44.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:03:00+00:00","modified":"2020-08-16T18:57:47+00:00","filename":"365bd25f5f9cd7bb1f227c6520e61c44.jpg","authentication":"3312d594c3db6c8eba326edd3645c2f4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":143,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL10_FL005_00011_o2.jpg","size":1104043,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2276,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044914852242401000215199502463292446918785572052001953125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0017"],"DateCreated":["20130329"],"TimeCreated":["085251+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0017"],"DateCreated":["20130329"],"TimeCreated":["085251+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0017"],"DateCreated":["20130329"],"TimeCreated":["085251+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"365bd25f5f9cd7bb1f227c6520e61c44.jpg","FileDateTime":1522681366,"FileSize":1104043,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2276\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2276,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0","FocusDistance":"1.33m"},"IFD0":{"Make":"NIKON CORPORATION","Model":"NIKON D800","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Windows","DateTime":"2013:04:12 08:43:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2013:03:29 08:52:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2013:03:29 08:52:51","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"SubjectDistance":1.3300000000000000710542735760100185871124267578125,"MeteringMode":5,"LightSource":0,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":60,"SubSecTime":0,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"SubSecTimeDigitized":0,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3135,"ExifImageLength":4957,"FocalPlaneXResolution":204.840209960940001110429875552654266357421875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":204.840209960940001110429875552654266357421875,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":4,"SensingMethod":2,"FileSource":"\u0003","SceneType":"\u0001","CFAPattern":"\u0002\u0000\u0002\u0000\u0000\u0001\u0001\u0002","CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"DigitalZoomRatio":1,"FocalLengthIn35mmFilm":60,"SceneCaptureType":0,"GainControl":0,"Contrast":0,"Saturation":0,"Sharpness":1,"SubjectDistanceRange":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3036148,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["600\/10","600\/10","28\/10","28\/10"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"60.0 mm f\/2.8"}}}},"item":{"id":1062,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1062","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"11\n- a few more years and the bones intombed in these hills of clay will have returned to their mother dust - in which case the story will be lost forever, unless the present generation be industrious.\nI have noticed, with some anxiety?, for wounds on the crania I have disintered and in one instance only did I discover any mark of the sort.  This is almost a circular cicatrix considerably indented, and situated on the superior aspect of the frontal bone.  It affords me no clue to the weapons with which these people fought or defended themselves.  It is amusing however to contemplate the tissue of circumstances which has been developed in relation to this Indian head, if an Indian one it be.  The mind is irrisistably forced into association with his family and friends who surrounded him, in his day, and marked with painful solicitude the angry threatnings of this dangerous wound. A thousand years may have intervened and the head of this primeval man is again exposed to the light of Heaven and the accident so indelibly registered on his skull, is once more a subject of interest.\nThe female crania in both the Va. Ohio & Miss Mounds very much resemble the Mummy skulls I have seen from Egypt and from the uncommon care resorted to for the preservation of their mortal remains, it would seem fair to infer that something like Egyptian opinions were held by these people relative to the connexion between the soul and body.  To attach insight to such an idea as this would be giving a high antiquity to the N. American Mounds.  The superstitious attitudes to prevailed on the Nile three thousand years ago and not since.  Dr. Robertson, it will be recollected, advanced the idea that a land communication once existed between Africa & America which has been destroyed by the attrition of the waters.....as I am now notising are something in .....theory, which no doubt is entirely his own.\nIn Dr. Mitchel's Medical Repository vol. 11 is an exh....history of Canada \"by George Heriot Esq.\" in  which......practically beautiful and marvellously strange things, he informs us that the Natchez Indians built Mounds, not for the purposes or war or defence but to build the houses of their chiefs on as a mark of distinction, the voluntary offering of Reverance.  From this writer's account of them they were highly agricultural, superstitious, idolitrous, and (like the natives of Hispaniola) so reverential that it would be esteemed impious not to dash out their brains should their chief require it. These were the only inhabitants of America which the avarice and cupidity of the spaniards could subject to slavery and these like the Hispaniolians or Snowauks of the West Indies, through Spanish cruelty are no more!\nIt is a common remark that the bones in these mounds are too well preserved to indicate a very great age to the mounds; hence a few remarks from me on this point will be interesting to you.  The Monumental Indians buried their dead in the best possible manner to preserve their remains; while we bury our dead in such a manner as to secure a very spedy destruction of the bones. They preserved their dead from the hurried action of chemical agents by surrounding the body immediately with clay - we place our dead in a box and this we put in a cavity made in the earth, neither of which is filled, and water finds its way in, and in a few years,","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71931,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71931","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/1ed2c0c00c0d39a07805b00e154d69dd.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/1ed2c0c00c0d39a07805b00e154d69dd.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/1ed2c0c00c0d39a07805b00e154d69dd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1ed2c0c00c0d39a07805b00e154d69dd.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:03:01+00:00","modified":"2020-08-16T19:03:49+00:00","filename":"1ed2c0c00c0d39a07805b00e154d69dd.jpg","authentication":"ae905577f997510443ac729be951523b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":144,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL10_FL005_00012_o2.jpg","size":1152472,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2241,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047617300477630998545297558166566886939108371734619140625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073916+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073916+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["073916+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1ed2c0c00c0d39a07805b00e154d69dd.jpg","FileDateTime":1522681366,"FileSize":1152472,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2241\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2241,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Windows","DateTime":"2013:04:12 08:32:12","Exif_IFD_Pointer":150},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:21 07:39:16","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:21 07:39:16","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":34,"SubSecTimeDigitized":34,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2876,"ExifImageLength":4619,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1062,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1062","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"11\/ by maceration, both flesh and bones are assimilated to the mother dust. This is the reason why we find some skeletons in our grave yards to be more decayed in ten years than those of the mounds which we have evidence to believe were buried from one to five hundred years.  After a bone is so well compacted in clay as to be defended from water, a solvent in which no animal organization can long be preserved, I know of no reason why it should not last from one to five thousand years.  There can be no doubt but that the bones of the Hyena and other animals, farmed in the caves of England, were covered several feet with clay by the subsidence of Noah's flood and subsequently defended from every species of invasion, except scientific, by stalagmites.

I say they seem to be extinct - A few Years ago my attention was attracted by a fine tumulus situated in a romantic spot on the junction of the French Broad and Holston rivers in East Tenne., on the summit of which the present owner Dr. Ramsey, has made a flower garden - He gave me permission to dig here and there around this tumulus and I had the good luck to find a whole skeleton, the bones were much mouldered but the head was entire and by imuring it with some varnish I succeeded in giving some consistence to the bone which enabled me to carry it home - Shortly after Dr. Morton in Philadelphia commenced his valuable work on the crania Americanis and requested me to contribute to it.  I sent him amongst some drawings of the skulls of modern Indians, that of the above mentioned skull, this skull differed so much from all of the American skulls in his possession, and he has the most numerous collection of them in the U.S., that he suspected the correctness of the drawing and it was only when he had compared the drawing with the object itself, that he gave it a place in his work - this skull is subscribed in the plate of Doct Morton from a Mound in Tenne.\nI have since discovered more of these skulls, males and females they have all a lateral compression, which","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71938,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71938","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/494a6e130b1b5bc19d9c15a2e1eb1121.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/494a6e130b1b5bc19d9c15a2e1eb1121.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/494a6e130b1b5bc19d9c15a2e1eb1121.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/494a6e130b1b5bc19d9c15a2e1eb1121.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:03:08+00:00","modified":"2020-08-17T03:23:14+00:00","filename":"494a6e130b1b5bc19d9c15a2e1eb1121.jpg","authentication":"e8277157f2e680b711a73f7c3b9250f2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":4,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL10_FL008_00003_o2.jpg","size":1122860,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2209,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047065875291316998374480107258932548575103282928466796875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["074258+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["074258+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["074258+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"494a6e130b1b5bc19d9c15a2e1eb1121.jpg","FileDateTime":1522681366,"FileSize":1122860,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2209\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2209,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Windows","DateTime":"2013:01:16 12:54:23","Exif_IFD_Pointer":150},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:21 07:42:58","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:21 07:42:58","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":86,"SubSecTimeDigitized":86,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2189,"ExifImageLength":3566,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1062,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1062","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"3\nI attribute to the mode of fastening the infant on a piece of bark or other hard substance in such manner that the mother could suckle it.  The anatomical difference between these and the other American skulls can be seen in the above mentioned work of Dr. Morton\nThat this race was very numerous is manifest from the frequent and extensive burying places which we find in several parts of our state.  I must first observe that so far as we can learn from tradition, amongst the present Indians (and I have conducted the oldest and the most instructed amongst these Cherokes and Creeks) this state and Kentucky were never permanently inhabited by any tribe, They visited them only in their Hunting excursions - they had an abhorence of KY the land of the dark and bloody ground and the burying places in which I found the skulls of Cherokees are few and not extensive.  Now this is not the case with the burying places in which I found the skulls in question - I will only mention those that are found in our neighbourhood.  We have one near the suburbs of our Town which extends from near the Cumberland River almost to Mr. Macgavocs it is about a mile in length, how much in breadth I cannot say, the road and the houses have covered one side and the Cultivated ground the other; In the field next to it a tumulus which is now worn down.  From the part that I have examined of this grand Yard, I found that the stone coffins were close to one another situated in such a manner that each corps was seperated only by a single stone from the other.  On the other side of the river about 1 1\/2 or 2 miles from this is another burying ground where the graves are equally numerous - at Cockerels spring 2 or 2 1\/2 miles from the first mentioned is another about 6 miles from Nashville on the Charlotte road, we have another at De Moss's near the Harpeth river another; at Haysboro another, so that in a circle of about 10 miles diameter we have 6 extensive burying grounds.  Some of our inhabitants consider these places as battle grounds and the graves as graves of the slain -  but that is not the case; The Indians do not bury their fallen foes; but leave them to be devoured by the wolf and other carnavorous animals","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71939,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71939","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8dba79fada27d6d255faedb1548d1d70.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8dba79fada27d6d255faedb1548d1d70.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8dba79fada27d6d255faedb1548d1d70.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8dba79fada27d6d255faedb1548d1d70.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:03:09+00:00","modified":"2020-08-17T03:36:56+00:00","filename":"8dba79fada27d6d255faedb1548d1d70.jpg","authentication":"72cda216f4466df5e067be47cbfd2f73","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":5,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL10_FL008_00004_o2.jpg","size":1236640,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2217,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05164803955963200021717085519412648864090442657470703125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["074240+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["074240+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["074240+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8dba79fada27d6d255faedb1548d1d70.jpg","FileDateTime":1522681366,"FileSize":1236640,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2217\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2217,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Windows","DateTime":"2013:01:16 12:56:02","Exif_IFD_Pointer":150},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:21 07:42:40","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:21 07:42:40","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":17,"SubSecTimeDigitized":17,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2205,"ExifImageLength":3579,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1062,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1062","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"4\ntheir own slain they carry to their Towns or hang up in mass on trees.

They were buried with their valuables such as laces, trinkets and utensils, these all being of a very rude construction and also formed of some natural production, non of metal, it is evident that they were less civilised than the Indians were when America was discovered by Columbus -

A similar jealousy caused a contest between the Plymouth traders at Kennebec, and a trading boat from Pascataqua, in which two men were killed.

Fort Chartres, on the east side of the Mississippi several miles above Kaskaskia, is built by the French.  The French settlements are more widely diffused over the country and the attention of the inhabitants directed to the pursuits of agriculture.  An expedition is fitted out from Sante Fe for the purpose of establishing a colony on the Missouri in the country then occupied by the nation of the Missouris.

Soon after this occurrence the French, under M. de Buyment, occupy an island in the Missouri (of which no traces now remain) supposed to have been a few miles above the mouth of Grand River, & built Fort Orleans.

They now commenced hostilities against the French and would have completely exterminated the colonists of that part of the country, but for the timely interposition of an influential Chief who had been prevailed upon by the French to dissuade the Indians from a further prosecution of the war. Peace was accordingly re-established with upright intentions & the purest motives on the part of the Indians, but on that of the French with the view of gaining strength sufficient to crush & extirpate that innocent people at a blow. It is not a little surprising that Bienville, then Commandant General of Louisiana, who had ever been conspicuous for integrity & humanity, should have connived at this barbarous policy of his countrymen. Although he had ratified the treaty, he very soon marched to Fort Rosalie at the head of 700 men, attacked the unsuspecting & defenceless Indians and slaughtered them in their huts.

The great purpose of the war, which was to expel or cripple the power of the French, on the western frontiers, was happily accomplished.  In Europe the war continued to rage, and in the West Indies, the British, aided by colonial troops, took Havanah from the Spaniards in 1762, an expedition in which multitudes of men fell victim to the bilious plague.

It is admitted by every body, that there cannot be a more vicious set of people than the whites who dwell on the boundaries:  they rob, murder, and betray the Indians; who, in return, frequently destroy their persecutors, together with their families; and when they perhaps take a dreadful revenge, they only defend themselves against unprovoked attacks:  these Indians are all as good, as generous, and","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":72052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/72052","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/48611c73486efb87f06f30b399314f34.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/48611c73486efb87f06f30b399314f34.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/48611c73486efb87f06f30b399314f34.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/48611c73486efb87f06f30b399314f34.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:04:33+00:00","modified":"2020-08-19T04:43:17+00:00","filename":"48611c73486efb87f06f30b399314f34.jpg","authentication":"1c26059c68410ef6e5d77cd72d18eb92","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":118,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL11_FL002_00117_o2.jpg","size":656130,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2314,"compression_ratio":0.0525088831268610001234975470651988871395587921142578125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["012930+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["012930+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["012930+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"48611c73486efb87f06f30b399314f34.jpg","FileDateTime":1522681369,"FileSize":656130,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2314\"","Height":2314,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2314,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:24:13","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5831},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:18 01:29:30","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:18 01:29:30","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":3,"SubSecTimeOriginal":3,"SubSecTimeDigitized":3,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2314,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1062,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1062","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"153\n1795 \n\n   \"and as faithful as those of the Northern States.

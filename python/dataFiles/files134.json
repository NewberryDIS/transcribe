May 15th\nMy Dear Cyntha, here I am, sitting in my school-room. I have just closed school and am not sorry another days work is done. As I write my boys are running back and forth to the stove to light their pipes (as they call them) being fierce of sticks which they light at one end and put the other in their mouth, they could not possibly go home without a playspell. I have a small school only eight as yet. I may have one or two more. The oldest is 12 and the youngest is 4 years.\nThursday Morning May 16th\nDear friend I have not mailed my letter yet so I will write a little more. I was very sorry to hear of the melancholy fate of your cats. I charged our folks to take good care of my kitten when I was gone, she has got to be quite lazy, does not play, hardly any but seems to enjoy sitting on the bible as well as ever or did before I came from home. Oh I wish I could transport you right up here to stay a week or two! but it is most time to call my boys in from recess and I must stop so good bye again.

Oh, then we will be twice happy!\nWe commenced to write you a family letter last oct.? hoping to have it finished in time to send you before Thanksgiving day, but that is now impossible, and as we fear we shall not be able to finish it before next week some of our number being so much engaged in \"the lust of the month\".

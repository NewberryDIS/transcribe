May 15th\nMy Dear Cyntha, here I am, sitting in my school-room. I have just closed school and am not sorry another days work is done. As I write my boys are running back and forth to the stove to light their pipes (as they call them) being fierce of sticks which they light at one end and put the other in their mouth, they could not possibly go home without a playspell. I have a small school only eight as yet. I may have one or two more. The oldest is 12 and the youngest is 4 years.\nThursday Morning May 16th\nDear friend I have not mailed my letter yet so I will write a little more. I was very sorry to hear of the melancholy fate of your cats. I charged our folks to take good care of my kitten when I was gone, she has got to be quite lazy, does not play, hardly any but seems to enjoy sitting on the bible as well as ever or did before I came from home. Oh I wish I could transport you right up here to stay a week or two! but it is most time to call my boys in from recess and I must stop so good bye again.

However, I think you stand upon the same ground and from your negligence deserve the same punishment.  Dr. has just been in, and wanted to know if I was writing to you; I told him, yes, and a real bad letter too: he said he didn't believe it, he didn't believe I would scold you at all.  he would change his mind if he only knew what I have written, but you think so?

C. Nov 18, 1881\nMy dear Brother\n\n As Dr. Grafs is going to the city and will be in your way? I thought I would not let the opportunity pass, with sending you a note. I hope you will be coming out to see me again before a great while, for I have a great deal that I want to say to you; and there is one thing in particular, that I would like to have a talk with you about, but I cannot do it by writing, for until I see you I know nothing certainly of how matters stand. But I will just mention it here, and then wait patiently until I can see you and have a private interview with you; I suppose you know what and who I have reference to; it is Miss P. and the attentions which you are paying to her. Are you in earnest, and have you any serious motive in thus cultivating her acquaintance, and seeking or at least encouraging her affection by your attentive manner towards her? If so, if you are in earnest, I have nothing to say; no objections to make, as I know of; but if you are not, my dear brother, let me encourage you to be circumspect; you are not fondly aware how very sensitive and easily won a lady's heart is. I know that you above all others would shrink with horror from even the idea of trifling with any one's feelings, but remember, you may do it without intending it if you are not on your guard. Perhaps I do not judge illegible not knowing more about it, and that is the reason several words illegible would you.

I have just closed school and am not sorry another days work is done. As I write my boys are running back and forth to the stove to light their pipes (as they call them) being fierce of sticks which they light at one end and put the other in their mouth, they could not possibly go home without a playspell. I have a small school only eight as yet. I may have one or two more. The oldest is 12 and the youngest is 4 years.\nThursday Morning May 16th\nDear friend I have not mailed my letter yet so I will write a little more. I was very sorry to hear of the melancholy fate of your cats. I charged our folks to take good care of my kitten when I was gone, she has got to be quite lazy, does not play, hardly any but seems to enjoy sitting on the bible as well as ever or did before I came from home. Oh I wish I could transport you right up here to stay a week or two! but it is most time to call my boys in from recess and I must stop so good bye again.

Do you not begin to feel guilty, are you not sorry?  only think of it, leaving a poor sick sister, twenty six miles from home, three weeks without a letter.  Isn't it too bad?  Dr. says, write to her and give her a good scolding and put her in mind that there are folks in N.Y. state as well as in Mass., even if you have gone there.  I wish I could remember all he says, but I cant; for every evening when he comes from the P.O. and brings me the sad news of no letter he has something or other to say, and very often finishes with \"tell her so, when you write.\"  if I could remember it all I rather think I should have no room to say anything else on the same sheet, so it is as well, perhaps, that my memory is poor.  You see the doctor lays all the blame on you and lets Mary go free, but I think she comes in for about an equal share.  he is not quite so well acquainted with her as he is with you, which, I suppose, accounts for it.  However, I think you stand upon the same ground and from your negligence deserve the same punishment.  Dr. has just been in, and wanted to know if I was writing to you; I told him, yes, and a real bad letter too: he said he didn't believe it, he didn't believe I would scold you at all.  he would change his mind if he only knew what I have written, but you think so?

C. Nov 18, 1881\nMy dear Brother\n\n As Dr. Grafs is going to the city and will be in your way I thought I would not let the opportunity pass, with sending you a note. I hope you will be coming out to see me again before a great while, for I have a great deal that I want to say to you; and there is one thing in particular, that I would like to have a talk with you about, but I cannot do it by writing, for until I see you I know nothing certainly of how matters stand. But I will just mention it here, and then wait patiently until I can see you and have a private interview with you; I suppose you know what and who I have reference to; it is Miss P. and the attentions which you are paying to her. Are you in earnest, and have you any serious motive in thus cultivating her acquaintance, and seeking or at least encouraging her affection by your attentive manner towards her? If so, if you are in earnest, I have nothing to say; no objections to make, as I know of; but if you are not, my dear brother, let me encourage you to be circumspect; you are not fondly aware how very sensitive and easily won a lady's heart is. I know that you above all others would shrink with horror from even the idea of trifling with any one's feelings, but remember, you may do it without intending it if you are not on your guard. Perhaps I do not judge illegible not knowing more about it, and that is the reason several words illegible would you.

I hardly know whether to expect them or not. It seems to me when any of you come to Utica you are almost here, but I suppose it is not so; eight miles makes a good deal of difference when any one is in a hurry, and therefore I am very much afraid that they will not be able to come. But I will hope for the best, and wait as patiently as I can and see what will happen. \u2014 You do not say very? much in your letter about its being so near the time for you to go East; perhaps you are in hopes that I will forget all about it, but never fear! my memory has not entirely forsaken me yet; the school commences just three weeks tomorrow.

Mother says in her note, that you are unwell with the influenza, but how unwell, and whether you are going back next term, she does not say. If you have not written already, I hope you will as soon as you receive this, for I shall be quite uneasy until I hear further from you. You are coming to see me before you go back, are you not? Oh, you must. I cant bear to think of you, going away without my seeing you. Write to me, and say you will certainly come, and then I will feel so much better. - Cousins Elisabeth and Alexander, and their cousin, Miss Bowen, came to see me yesterday afternoon; I had not seen Elisabeth but once before since I came here. We had a very pleasant visit. They brought the things that mother sent to me. Tell her, I like them very much indeed; they are just what I wanted. I shall be very glad to get this long sack, although I did not ask for it. I have got it on today, it fits well, and feels so comfortable; and those night caps too, I needed them very much; if ma had been home, I cold hardly have told her better what I wanted.

Wont we have a delightful time if we can visit him some few years hence, in the fall, when the apples are ripe? John brought me a likeness of his and gave it t me, I had not had one of his here before but I had told him that I wanted it a good any times: I do not think I ever saw a better one of him than this one is, it seems almost perfect; the expression is so good. \n Oh, girls, I believe I will give you a little description of two of the girls that are now in my room for they are talking and laughing so that I can hardly think of anything else. They are the only young girls that are here (of patients, I mean) excepting myself. I will begin with Gertrude Sawyer as she is the oldest. She is about eighteen. She is not pretty, I don't think, but she has got pretty eyes and teeth: she is good-hearted but Oh \n\ntop margin:\nIt was Kate that directed my two last letters, perhaps she will direct this and perhaps Gertrude and perhaps the Dr. will. I dont know yet if Dr. knew I was writing I guess he would send his love or respects, but he does unclear and probably will not until this is finished and sealed. They say they have not heard from you at home in three weeks. I suppose you are too busy but you will soon have time unclear I hope. John wanted to know if you were not coming home this vacation.

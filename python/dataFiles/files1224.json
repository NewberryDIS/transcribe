Rice does not fear any trouble with his brakeman at this point as he thinks there would not be over 25 men who would strike.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                Tuesday April 17\/88\n\nOpt. said reporting yesterday all has been quiet; there was a report circulated there today that the guard were going away and about 30 or 40 of the strikers came within a block of the companys grounds when they discovered they had not left they dispersed.  The report was causet by Opt. calling the guards in to swear them in a Deputy Sheriffs as they only had been sworn the first time for 30 days; they being sworn this time for 90 days and the strikers seeing the men called in, supposed it was to be sent away.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                 Wednesday April 18\/88\n\nToday Opt. reports everything quiet since he reported yesterday.  He says he saw Rhodes when he was coming from Mendola last Saturday and he said everything was going on well.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                  Thursday April 19\/88\n\nOpt. reports everything quiet Opt. went to Buda today and saw Opt.\"R.W","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":96683,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/96683","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/68cd46faafbeb68f58d38792e9e6879a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/68cd46faafbeb68f58d38792e9e6879a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/68cd46faafbeb68f58d38792e9e6879a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/68cd46faafbeb68f58d38792e9e6879a.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T21:53:48+00:00","modified":"2020-05-22T16:59:43+00:00","filename":"68cd46faafbeb68f58d38792e9e6879a.jpg","authentication":"745e17390b579b39a8f38ba41d718035","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"cbq_033_1880_09_box_109_fl_829_021_003_o2.jpg","size":911787,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2286,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.036931199572276},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"SpecialInstructions":["What is the Midwest"],"DateCreated":["20181024"],"TimeCreated":["030439"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["887766"],"Source":["CB&Q 33 1880 9 Box 109"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"SpecialInstructions":["What is the Midwest"],"DateCreated":["20181024"],"TimeCreated":["030439"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["887766"],"Source":["CB&Q 33 1880 9 Box 109"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"SpecialInstructions":["What is the Midwest"],"DateCreated":["20181024"],"TimeCreated":["030439"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["887766"],"Source":["CB&Q 33 1880 9 Box 109"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"68cd46faafbeb68f58d38792e9e6879a.jpg","FileDateTime":1586728403,"FileSize":911787,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2286\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2286,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:10:24 15:19:24","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:10:24 03:04:39","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:10:24 03:04:39","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2904,"ExifImageLength":4573,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1224,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1224","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"who is in charge there.

As to the line of defense they were gong to make but could learn nothing in the evening Opr went around with the City Marshall they went to the White Elephant Saloon. Also remained around the saloon of the Brown Hotel mixing with people but was unable to learn anything of importance. The case Opr says will probably close tomorrow Opr thinks from what he can learn that they will not make any defense to speak of but simply get the outlines and strength of our case and will make their defense in the Upper Court after they hear our Evidence.\nYours Respectfully\nPinkertons Nat Det Agcy\nper Wm A.

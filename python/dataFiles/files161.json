I shall want to visit you in some way before long.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":37240,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/37240","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c492d7d8bd8bce2894322a69364bec5a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c492d7d8bd8bce2894322a69364bec5a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c492d7d8bd8bce2894322a69364bec5a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c492d7d8bd8bce2894322a69364bec5a.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-17T16:01:37+00:00","modified":"2020-03-27T11:21:57+00:00","filename":"c492d7d8bd8bce2894322a69364bec5a.jpg","authentication":"67bf29a2c505bf1b58ce4b2a10508815","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_12_fl_447_046_03_o2.jpg","size":1368876,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2954,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042907169186790002080034156506371800787746906280517578125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["yp"],"DateCreated":["20160802"],"TimeCreated":["052133+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["yp"],"DateCreated":["20160802"],"TimeCreated":["052133+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["yp"],"DateCreated":["20160802"],"TimeCreated":["052133+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c492d7d8bd8bce2894322a69364bec5a.jpg","FileDateTime":1508256078,"FileSize":1368876,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2954\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2954,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:04 10:30:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01000000000000000020816681711721685132943093776702880859375,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:08:02 05:21:33","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:08:02 05:21:33","ShutterSpeedValue":6.64385600000000042797410060302354395389556884765625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTime":83,"SubSecTimeOriginal":83,"SubSecTimeDigitized":83,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1876,"ExifImageLength":2286,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":161,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/161","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I had hoped the memoir would be out of press by the first of Feb. but when it is ready I hope nothing will hinder my going out with it.

I know you must be enjoying your visit, and if you do not take cold it will do you so much good.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":37287,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/37287","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/10eea1f84531ea9ed445d7961b48a2e6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/10eea1f84531ea9ed445d7961b48a2e6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/10eea1f84531ea9ed445d7961b48a2e6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/10eea1f84531ea9ed445d7961b48a2e6.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-17T16:03:47+00:00","modified":"2020-04-01T23:17:01+00:00","filename":"10eea1f84531ea9ed445d7961b48a2e6.jpg","authentication":"21771fe6a47a83269300901b3eb29cad","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_12_fl_447_062_02_o2.jpg","size":1106716,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2347,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.043661569537154998332795230453484691679477691650390625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["yp"],"DateCreated":["20160802"],"TimeCreated":["052537+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["yp"],"DateCreated":["20160802"],"TimeCreated":["052537+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["yp"],"DateCreated":["20160802"],"TimeCreated":["052537+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"10eea1f84531ea9ed445d7961b48a2e6.jpg","FileDateTime":1508256080,"FileSize":1106716,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2347\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2347,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:04 10:31:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01000000000000000020816681711721685132943093776702880859375,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:08:02 05:25:37","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:08:02 05:25:37","ShutterSpeedValue":6.64385600000000042797410060302354395389556884765625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTime":83,"SubSecTimeOriginal":83,"SubSecTimeDigitized":83,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1885,"ExifImageLength":2891,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":161,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/161","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"We received letters from Anna and Mary the latter part of last week and I have answered both, so now I am going to provoke a letter from you.

We have been buying some new books for double entry but will commence on it tomorrow.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":37342,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/37342","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/da7b314c4a0fe266144731e843f61733.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/da7b314c4a0fe266144731e843f61733.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/da7b314c4a0fe266144731e843f61733.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/da7b314c4a0fe266144731e843f61733.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-17T16:06:31+00:00","modified":"2020-04-03T02:33:21+00:00","filename":"da7b314c4a0fe266144731e843f61733.jpg","authentication":"c7708b4a4e26be284bddffcb2ada0dd7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_12_fl_451_002_02_o2.jpg","size":1142342,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2304,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.045908162937243000845111140506560332141816616058349609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["yp"],"DateCreated":["20160802"],"TimeCreated":["235813+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["yp"],"DateCreated":["20160802"],"TimeCreated":["235813+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["yp"],"DateCreated":["20160802"],"TimeCreated":["235813+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"da7b314c4a0fe266144731e843f61733.jpg","FileDateTime":1508256082,"FileSize":1142342,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2304\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2304,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:04 10:33:41","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01000000000000000020816681711721685132943093776702880859375,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:08:02 23:58:13","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:08:02 23:58:13","ShutterSpeedValue":6.64385600000000042797410060302354395389556884765625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTime":66,"SubSecTimeOriginal":66,"SubSecTimeDigitized":66,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1864,"ExifImageLength":2912,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":161,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/161","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Robert James brought John down this morning and stayed down to dinner.

I intended to write you a letter but this will be better than nothing. Thanks for the Acon. I will send Jennie's umbrella first chance. She need not send the money to pay for it. Do not send the coat by mail but wait until you get a convenient chance to send it. We are all well. Prof. Clark Reis gave two lectures here on the great pyramids of Egypt. If he comes to Remsen do not fail to hear him.

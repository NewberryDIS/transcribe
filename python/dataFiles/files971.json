William Edwards aged about 70 in 1801 at Goshen on the Muskingum, and David Zeisberger at the same place in 1808, while at Bethlehem in the same Year, the two venerable Missionaries, Grube and Youngman, were also called from hence to meet together in the presence of that Lord and Savior, whom they so faithfully served here below; to receive their reward of him.\n\n    It is remarkable, that these last three Venerable Missionaries, who at an early period of their lives, had entered into that service with the resolution to endure for Christs sake, all hardships, privations, persecutions and dangers which might befal them- and who indeed had, during long services, given proof of their firmness, by the numerous hardships and trials they had endured: should live to such advanced Ages, as they did, and therewith enjoy generally good health to the last.   Bernhard Adam Grube, who had been the first Missionary to the Delawares, and spoke their Language well, died at Bethlehem on the 20th of March 1808. aged 93 Years and three Months.

David Zeisberger, senior Missionary of the United Brethren among the Indians, aged Eighty seven Years and seven Months.\n'He was a native of Moravia in Germany, from whence he emigrated with his parents at an early age to Herrnhuth in Upper Lusatia, for the sake of obtaining religious liberty.  In 1738 he came to this Country, landed in Georgia, where at that time some of the United Brethren had begun a Settlement, merely for the purpose of preaching the Gospel to the Creek Nation.  From thence he removed to Pennsylvania, and assisted at the commencement of the Settlements of Bethlehem and Nazareth. Ever since the Year 1746, a period of Sixty-two Years, he has, with few and short intervals, been a Missionary among the Indians, making himself master of Sundry of their languages\"\n\n  'He was blessed with a cool, active, intrepid Spirit not appalled at any danger or difficulties, and a sound judgment to discern the best means of meeting and overcoming them. Having once devoted himself to the service of God among the Indians, he steadily, from the most voluntary choice, and with the purest motives, pursued his object, namely, the glory of his Redeemer, in the salvation of his fellow Men, whom he found sunk in heathenish darkness, and error.

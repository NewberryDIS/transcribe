As you had manifested in your letter of Saturday an axiety that Jane might not lose but as little as may be of the present term - being the last for her - and as Robert was up - it was thought all around by us that it would be better for Jane to take a short notice and go with Robert - so they got up midth..i? early yesterday morning and she went with her brother, with the expectation of reaching Mt. Holyoke last evening - So Jane did not get  your letter - but it is so appropriate for her - I think I will send it, and a few words besides to her today or tomorrow morning. John has set out his orchard - some of his trees begin to show the tender leaf opening already - but this weather is very dry - we have planted potatoes and have some oats. The girls washed and dried their clothes yesterday and are ironing today - had a little calf day before yesterday - have done away with it - and have had feed for the cow from mill - All of us are well- are glad that you have in prospect to come home so soon - still if Sarah is not well enough to be left we will wait a little longer yet, one 9 Welsh words follow \"operation\" 10 Welsh words follow.

But we are not left without consolation-- she had spoken as one that loved the Savior, and had expressed a desire to make a public profession of his name-- if her life were spared. Your mother had spoken to her, and had prayed with her the last time she had been to see her-- also I had spoken some to her at another time. Her father had asked her sometime during last days if she tried to pray for herself-- she said that she did. He asked her, if she had some comfort in prayer and hoped the Lord heard her prayer. She said she did hope so, and had pleasure in prayer. Also she said she had no dread of death as she used to have. Thus calmly & hopefully did she leave all earthly scenes, to ascend as we trust to brighter scenes amid the ransomed of the Lord above. Dr Fowler deliverd a very affectionate address to the mourners and the congregation at the chapel of the First church and she was burried at the cemetery. I returned with Jane last evening-- mother, Sarah & Cynthia are to come home today. Mary did not come down from N. G. -- But intended to come to Utica and home on Thursday (tomorrow) she feared the excitement would be too much for her.

please on marked part\nRemsen Feb. 22 1886\nMy Dear Daughter Jane\nWe have lately had two or three letters from you, and were quite sorry that you had been so long kept in suspense and in such anxiety with reference to your brother Robert's sickness-- before you heard that he was better. The way it happened (I think) was this-- After our first letter by Sissy, I wrote, I think it was the next day-- But snow storms then commenced to come, and for several days the cars could not go-- and the mail stopped. I feared then that our second letter could not reach you for several days after the first one. Robert + Mary are in New Graefenberg since a week ago last Monday (11th). He is getting better as you will see by the inclosed letters from them which we got yesterday. We had a letter yesterday also from John, quite a brief one-- in which he says Sarah had not had chills since they had written the week before. and she had then been free from the chills for three or four days-- so this would make about 10 days since she had had any chills. Frankey was quite well.  John's health was improving. Yesterday was our Donation day. The roads were very bad, with snow drifts-- the last Sabbath having been such that I was notable to go to Penymynyd-- Still we had quite a company though not nearly as crowded in the evening as you have seen in former times. The Donation in money was $196-- goods about $16. Some of this, of course, would have come in as contributions or salary, if we had not had the D--n-- Still it was a good Donation considering this state of the roads-- Mr J.W. Roberts was as active and faithful as ever. He frequently asks whether we have heard from Jane-- and want to be remembered to you. All of us joining in love to you I rem your affect father\nRobert Everett\nI wrote to Rev. J. Williams, Palmyra - to thank him for the affection him and his family had shown to my beloved daughter and I received a very kind letter from him in return-- they seem to have been much pleased with the visit-- and Mr. W. spoke very respectfully indeed of your school and of the feelings of your friends with reference to it at Hudson.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":34453,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/34453","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/f977b08b9c849d4a641b9ff470561987.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/f977b08b9c849d4a641b9ff470561987.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/f977b08b9c849d4a641b9ff470561987.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f977b08b9c849d4a641b9ff470561987.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T15:36:24+00:00","modified":"2020-08-10T17:23:48+00:00","filename":"f977b08b9c849d4a641b9ff470561987.jpg","authentication":"5b57362b82e3b3004a26573addcd7328","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_01_fl_007_006_01_o2.jpg","size":1029696,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2282,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041780114908949},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["013823"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160301"],"DigitalCreationTime":["013823"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["013823"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160301"],"DigitalCreationTime":["013823"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["013823"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160301"],"DigitalCreationTime":["013823"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f977b08b9c849d4a641b9ff470561987.jpg","FileDateTime":1507735967,"FileSize":1029696,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2282\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2282,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:06:10 11:28:15","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:01 01:38:23","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:01 01:38:23","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":147,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/147","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Remsen Jan. 1, 1859\nDear Jannie and Sis;\nMay I write to you both at once?

Lewis had returned on Saturday, a week ago last Saturday - Your mother remained there a little over one week. They reached on Friday eve (the 9th) Sarah was much fatigued and had spasms rather bad - the following day Saturday had spasms much worse - but was better the following day, and on Monday was comfortable, and from that day has been under treatment. Your mother has considerable confidence in Dr. Strong and his wife, and in their treatment. Sarah was rather improving in some things - and had not had any more of the spasms. - She felt happy in her new situation, surrounded by many affectionate and sympathysing friends. Let us try to remember her in our daily supplication, at the time? of grace, to which I hope and trust, Dear John, you are not an entire stranger. Your mother seems about as well as when she left home. We continue in the family the plan of having subjects to recite verses on - the one last week was \"Benevolence\" - this week \"the future state\". Your letter from Auburn I recvd the following day, after you wrote - and on the morning following (Friday I think or Thursday) I sent it on with a few lines from myself - to Philadelphia. I shall be expecting daily now for an answer - it may come this evening. - If it comes today or tomorrow I will forward it to you, care of Rev. Thos Evans, Youngstown - if later, I will send to meet you at Pittsburgh, Care of Mister D. E. Evans. We are getting along tolerably well with Cenhadwr - Did not commence setting till the 5th having had to clean and white wash the office. today we are printing the last face of 1st Form - and have 2 galleys towards next form set - Anna helps some. Gth Jones is with us today having potatoes. Lewis & Eddy ploughed them on Saturday. We are all well at home - had a letter a few days ago from Jorthrga? Gwynes? - he is going to leave for America with his family in August. Sold one U. J. C.? to Levi James, yesterday. Hope you will be careful of your health - not to be too ardent, and work too hard. Better do a little and have your health improved, than do more, and to fail in health. Mother wrote to Sarah Mariah at Saratoga, and finishes it today, to which the girls are adding some. Your Sister's address is care of Dr. E. S. Strong, Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Robt & Jane are well. Your father,  all joining in love & c  R.

I think I will send today a few numbers for July to Mr D. E.

Try all you can to talk Welsh - the Welsh people will love to hear Welsh talk, though it be broken, - and using will rub off the rust. - I will try to find the portrait and the cut you mentioned, and send them. I will write to Mr. Edwards and Mr Evans. - Please write often. - You can tell better than we can with reference to the Atlas. Perhaps if you do not see it best to take it, you had better drop them a line to give the reason of your declining. - We mailed the Cenhadwr on Saturday. Sent you a No. - We had one letter from Sarah since your mother came home - She was comfortable, and hopeful. It was written by some friend for her.

This last storm seemed to vie with its predecessors in sublimity and grandeur. I failed to go to Penymnydd? last Sabbath - did not attempt it - mother and the girls would not let me try - there was so little hope that I could get through if I had started - and it was rough and very cold. Today is calm and pleasant - almost as if the harbinger of opening spring weather. We are quite anxious to hear how Robert is, and Mary also.

 June 29. 1848\n\nDear Sarah.   It is now about a week since you went to that awful place as you call it. probably it seems somewhat less awful now than at first.  Sure it is, I could not see anything so very dismal about it, on the contrary  I think it quite a desirable location if one is out of health, indeed, I should like to be with you there this minute, and would if I could fly. Should like nothing better. Suppose you have become quite initiated into baths, and sheets, and packs, by this time, though you could give me an introduction should I visit you?  Jane has gone home and you do not know how lonely it seems here. And Sarah too gone, it seems as though we had lost half of the house. Robert brought me today some of the nicest milk, wish you and Mother could be here that I might make you some good sweet custard. Have you moved into your nice little room in the third story yet?  Wish I could drop in this afternoon and see how you look. our house is getting along slowly - it will be a month yet probably before we can get settled.The term is about closing up at the Seminary - the students are beginning to scatter. Write to me soon and tell me all about yourself.  Your affectionate Sister  Elisabeth\n\nwritten on left side and across top:\nSat morn. I've received your very welcome notes this morning. Am glad to learn that you are both getting more contented. Wish you could have reported more decided improvement in your health, though in a short time we could not expect a great change. Have just been making some pumpkin pies with that milk that Robert brought, wish I could send you some. But I suppose you think that water is better than all the pumpkins and everything else that you can think of\n\nBut it is time that this should go to the office. Hope you will get it today. You do not know how glad we were to hear from you - hope you will write as often as you can. Thank Mother particularly for her note - it is so seldom that we get anything from her - with love from Mr Butler and myself  I remain your affectionate Daughter? & sister  E.E.

The memoir of Mrs. Prior, I think you will find very interesting and also \"Judah's Lion.\" If you have not read the last mentioned I wish you would - I know you will like it. Any thing that has to do with with (sic) the Jewish nation is doubly interesting. Hope you will write us very soon, and tell us particularly about your health. With much love Your Affectionate Daughter Elizabeth\nWritten along the side: I have had a most miserable pen and no knife to mend it.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":34493,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/34493","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7cb3a00a8dd764e6b1ef00b8ae4857d3.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7cb3a00a8dd764e6b1ef00b8ae4857d3.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7cb3a00a8dd764e6b1ef00b8ae4857d3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7cb3a00a8dd764e6b1ef00b8ae4857d3.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T15:37:58+00:00","modified":"2020-08-12T23:59:57+00:00","filename":"7cb3a00a8dd764e6b1ef00b8ae4857d3.jpg","authentication":"0999a7119cb2c4a312d77b2ba2e55b03","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_01_fl_012_002_03_o2.jpg","size":1188988,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2881,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.038212940465631},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["033322"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["033322"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["033322"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7cb3a00a8dd764e6b1ef00b8ae4857d3.jpg","FileDateTime":1507735968,"FileSize":1188988,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2881\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2881,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:03:02 10:51:28","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:01 03:33:22","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:01 03:33:22","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":64,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2462,"ExifImageLength":3076,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":147,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/147","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Miss Sarah A.

We have not had one as yet. Robert came home with John on Saturday evening - and both went off again to Utica yesterday Morning. John  wanted to go for some iron bar for the office - expect him back this evening - though it is uncertain, as it is now about tea time. Your Ma is in Whitesboro since a week today - have not heard from them since Saturday - your sister was comfortable there. and the baby doing well. Our family looks quite small now - only Anna & Eddy of our folks today, and Mary Jones, and the boys and Mr. Davies in the office. We feel cheered to hear from you time to time that you are \"some better\" - since your general health is gradually improving I feel that we ought to be very thankful - and that is all we can now expect. When you gain a little more strength I am expecting your spine complaint will yield gradually to the treatment - am glad your courage is kept up so well. Look to the Lord, dear daughter, for his blessing - We don't forget you before the throne of grace in the closet or in the family - hope you can cast all your burden on the Lord, and cheerfully confide in his wisdom and goodness, with reference to health and all things.

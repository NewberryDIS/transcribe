Dec. 9. 1857\nDear Jane and Anna--\nThe mournful intelligence we have at last to communicate-- Our dear Lizzy is gone she died last Sabbath morning about 1\/4 past 3, and was burried yesterday afternoon. But we are not left without consolation-- she had spoken as one that loved the Savior, and had expressed a desire to make a unsure profession of his name-- if her life were spared. Your mother had spoken to her, and had prayed with her the last time she had been to see her-- also I had spoken some to her at another time. Her father had asked her sometime during last days if she tried to pray for herself-- she said that she did. He asked her, if she had some comfort in prayer and hoped the Lord heard her prayer. She said she did hope so, and had pleasure in prayer. Also she said she had no dread of death as she used to have. Thus calmly + hopefully did she leave all earthly scenes, to ascend as we trust to brighten scenes amid the unsure of the Lord above. Dr unsure deliverd a very affectionate address to the mourners and the congregation at the chapel of the unsure church and she was burried at the cemetery. I unsure with Jane last evening-- mother, Sarah + Cynthia are to come home today. Mary did not come down from N. G. -- But intended to come to Utica and home on Thursday (tomorrow) she feared the excitement would be too much for her. Probably Sarah or unsure will stay for Mary till tomorrow when we hope to see her home again, somewhat improved in health.

anxiety with reference to your brother Robert's sickness-- before you heard that he was better. The way it happened (I think) was this-- After our first letter by Sissy, I wrote, I think it was the next day-- But snow storms then commenced to come, and for several days the unsure could not go-- and the mail stopped. I feared then that our unsure letter could not reach you for several days after the first one. Robert + Mary are in New Graunsure since a week ago lat Monday (11th). He is getting better as you will see by the inclosed letters from them which we got yesterday. We had a letter yesterday also from John, quite a brief one-- in which he says Sarah had not had chills since they had written the week before. and she had then been free from the chills for three or four days-- so this would make about 10 days since she had had any chills. Frankey was quite well.  John's health was improving. Yesterday was our Donation day. The roads were very bad, with snow drafts-- the unsure Sabbath having been such that I was notable to go to Penymynyd-- Still we had quite a company though not nearly as crowded in the evening as you have seen in former times. The Donation in money was $190-- goods about $16. Some of this, of course, would have come in as contributions or salary, if we had not had the D--n-- Still it was a good Donation considering this state of the roads-- the J.W. Roberts was as active and faithful as ever. He frequently asks whether we have heard from Jane-- and want to be remembered to you. All of us joining in love to you I rem your affect father\nRobert Everett\nI wrote to Rev. J.

Your mother has considerable confidence in Dr. Strong and his wife, and in their treatment. Sarah was rather improving in some things - and had not had any more of the spasms. - She felt happy in her new situation, surrounded by many affectionate and sympathysing friends. Let us try to remember her in our daily supplication, at the time? of grace, to which I hope and trust, Dear John, you are not an entire stranger.

We are writing? today to Sarah Maria. I have a $10 bill in the house and will send it to her, and get the same amount again of Robert - so that will be as payment of $10 from Robert. I think I will send today a few numbers for July to Mr D. E. Evans and also to Mr. D Edwards, and will pay the postage of these two parcels, that they may have them in hand to use, if called for. - I think it is best to let them get subscribers than for you to do it. - I am sending this to Ebensburg, where it will meet you I hope in safety. Try all you can to talk Welsh - the Welsh people will love to hear Welsh talk, though it be broken, - and using will rub off the rust. - I will try to find the portrait and the cut you mentioned, and send them. I will write to Mr. Edwards and Mr Evans. - Please write often. - You can tell better than we can with reference to the Atlas. Perhaps if you do not see it best to take it, you had better drop them a line to give the reason of your declining. - We mailed the Cenhadwr on Saturday. Sent you a No. - We had one letter from Sarah since your mother came home - She was comfortable, and hopeful. It was written by some friend for her. We hope to have a letter again from her - perhaps this eveng. - I will write again to meet you at Pittsburgh care of D E Evans - We all join in love to you. - Your affectionate father Robt

Where is cousin Jane all this time, that she has not written me a word does she think she has given us all the advice needful and think she will be silent not to give us time to think upon what she has said? if so tell her she is taking the wrong course, it would be better to remind us of it occasionally, to be sure that it would not be forgotten, or come herself and see that we practice all the economy she advised, we think the last would be prefrable. If she thinks so and will act accordingly we will endeavour to make her visit as agreeable as possible, which I think will not be very difficult with the pleasant home and kind friends we have and every thing pleasant connected with it, any one could hardly help being happy here, you will think I am getting to be quite enthusiastic on the subject, but if you think so call upon us and you will say then that I have every reason to be well pleased with my new relations and home and would be very ungrateful if I were not happy in the enjoyment of such unclear  friends as kind and affectionate as I could wish and health very much improved since you saw me, and Thomas health is very good at present.

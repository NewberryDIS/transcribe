Before I go any farther however I had better explain the snotty little squib pinned to this letter.   I tried to get some publicity on THE DISINHERITED and that was the best I was able to do, proving the great influence I have in the S.F.   literary world.  (The clipping is from the Argonaut, one of the worst weeklies in the U.S.).  While I am apologizing I had better admit that I have not yet read THE DISINHERITED, although I did read some of the extracts in the Mercury.\n   The rest of this is business.   The Artists and Writers Union, 325 Kearny Street, S. F., is opening a magazine shop, for the very good reason that there is no place out here where one can buy any of the so-called little mags, either proletarian of \"literary\" (with the exception of a very few of the better known ones), and we would like you to send us a bundle of 5 copies of the last issue to start with.   As I understand it the usual procedure is to remit the amount of money due for the copies sold at the time of each new issue, at the same time mailing back (at  our expense) the covers of all unsold copies, and in case you want unsold copies returned intact the postage is deducted from the remittance.  Correct?   Also, dont forget to tell us what our MARGIN OF PROFIT  is!\n   A bit of rush service on this would be much appreciated.\n\nSincerely,\nsignature:  Leon Doray\nLeon Doray\n(Recording Sec'y, A&WU\nP.S.

Might be handy if you come to Chi. for a weekend.  One guy (wrote an article about it) flew 3700 miles for $30.\n   I am working on a spy novel, and when and if I'll show it to you.\n  Holt did a great thing in publishing Malreaux's book Anti Memoirs.

I'm still in this world.   Hope you are too so we may more readily communicate.  I'm in a fine little cabin back in the redwoods doing the bachelor thing and trying to finish underlined:  Miss Amerika which I've been at 5 years.  Maybe by June.  I did a novella called underlined: the Wave about this area and it's come back from Doubleday and Knopf.

Penrod finished his novel and it bounces around publishers now.  We aren't talking still.  Willie gets his snits.  Perrill lives here up the mountain and is finishing a novel.\n What's with your writing and other activities?  The autobiog?  You in OK health?  What's with Algren?\n  Do you have an agent now?  Any clues on where to send a novel?\n  The weather is wet but warm out here.  Beautiful place.\n  Let me hear your voice, oh Sage, if you're still ramblin' around.

I am getting my oldest neice [sic] to write this letter for me.  On June 4th - 1943 I was stricken with paraleys [sic] on my right side.   I have not taken a step since.  I manage to sit up about an hour each day.  I still read some and listen to the radio.  My arm and leg give me some pain.  I do not have time to discuss the war with you, much as I would like to.  My son is in N. Africa somewhere.  I do not know where, or what he is doing.  I may as well have used a postal card for all I am saying.  There is no indication that I shall ever improve.  But when I think of so many young men dying on the battle field I become fully reconciled to my fate.  I had many plans made for 1943.  In fact I had made a trip the day before I was stricken.  I was to go the next day on a trip with Butler U.  I think of my many trips the last ten years.  I had become a specialist on Sedges, but all these belong to the past.  I am at home and I receive good care.  Some days I listen to a dozen news broadcasts.  We shall gain a military victory but loose [sic] the war on the home front.

You probably have your own plans and are quite busy--but I hope you can send us some writing for the first issue and will think about taking part on any level you like--from active to honorary editor, down the line.\nThe magazine will be produced in a very professional way, high standards for its appearance.  We have the help of a professional designer.  I assume it will be a little magazine format, though that will be decided by the editors later.  We will plan a circulation of a few thousand from the start, anything less is not worthwhile.  (If that sounds fanciful, we have supporters in a number of different cities who will place it in bookstores and otherwise dispose of it; and we will use large mailing lists as well.)\nMoney is not the obstacle we have to get past at this point.

Your novel has earth and sun and man and machine - and how good it was for me to have reaffirmed the life that becomes only an abstract sense in the chaos of NY.  I have always admired you, Jack, even before I ever wrote to you.  I've always been aware of the pioneer work you are doing.  You see, you're down to earth, and when the decisive days come the breath of the soil will be within you and your heart will beat with the new order - and where will the bleating jackasses be, on probably where they spend many of their inspirational hours having their balls scratched in the bohemian studios of some muchly married amorosa.  Most of these literary bastards need a big city like New York in which to unburden their pathological natures.\n\n   Of course I'll send you a few copies of Trend.  As for handbills, we had some printed, but their [sic] sleazy as hell, so I won't send a batch, only a couple for you.  Send me a batch of overleafs.  I'll send them along wherever possible.\n   How's Anvil getting on?  Isn't there a Jan-Feb issue, or have I slipped up?\n\nApril 3\n\n I've  had an eye operation - and its left me on the shelf - I'm pretty low!

I am fascinated by the fact that the town changed so little between your generation and mine.  I mean, I had the same experiences you did generally and often specifically.  My friends and I too wondered about \"Morphodites,\" and our reasonings had the same twists and turns as yours and your friends!  Within the phenomenon called regional culture I wonder if there existed in those days a narrower strictly local culture which passed down from generation to generation.  I wonder if us Moberly boys don't have shared experiences different even from, say, Columbia boys.\n  Hope this finds you and Gladys well.

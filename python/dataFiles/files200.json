The Bible then is not averse to Education. Religion and learning go hand in hand. They are Essentially one. A true Education covers both. Any acquaintance with God in his spiritual nature and in his works constitutes the \"Wisdom and knowledge\" which are prescribed to render stable the church of God.\nAnd here let it be observed that the truth of this scripture statement is confirmed in a Signal manner by the Element of permanence in the institutions of learning themselves. Humanly speaking no institutions of the world live like schools of higher learning. The colleges of Oxford and Cambridge have outlived the dynasties of Tudors and Stuarts. The Monarchy might perish forever, and these would flourish in immortal youth. Harvard and Yale, and Brown and Columbia, and Nassan Hall, and the University of Pennsylvania survived the Revolution, and Southern Colleges are the first to come forth from the Calamities of the Rebellion.\nSuch facts are suggestive and lead to the inquiry which we shall consider this morning. Whether or not the permanence and officiency of a Christian denomination is largely conditioned upon the Educational facilities which it affords.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":45156,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/45156","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b2ff2fb41ac02ed7245fcb32ddbc5b65.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b2ff2fb41ac02ed7245fcb32ddbc5b65.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b2ff2fb41ac02ed7245fcb32ddbc5b65.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b2ff2fb41ac02ed7245fcb32ddbc5b65.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-03T17:01:09+00:00","modified":"2019-11-12T21:28:38+00:00","filename":"b2ff2fb41ac02ed7245fcb32ddbc5b65.jpg","authentication":"7b44796caf5949ca02e0c5f09e68c3a2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_taylor_e_bx_01_fl_001_01_007_o2.jpg","size":961805,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1817,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04901266841965799814229143294141977094113826751708984375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170921"],"TimeCreated":["022943"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170921"],"TimeCreated":["022943"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170921"],"TimeCreated":["022943"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b2ff2fb41ac02ed7245fcb32ddbc5b65.jpg","FileDateTime":1509728440,"FileSize":961805,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1817\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":1817,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"16mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/9.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:09:21 14:55:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":9,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:09:21 02:29:43","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:09:21 02:29:43","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2700,"ExifImageLength":5347,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":200,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/200","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Needs Review","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1.

So with a denomination, the church society that moves most in the Circles of the Educated and Cultured may expect to Exent the greatest power in drawing this class to its fold.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":45170,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/45170","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b689f3a83d55a84b4496b5bb9e949b07.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b689f3a83d55a84b4496b5bb9e949b07.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b689f3a83d55a84b4496b5bb9e949b07.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b689f3a83d55a84b4496b5bb9e949b07.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-03T17:01:53+00:00","modified":"2019-11-12T21:28:38+00:00","filename":"b689f3a83d55a84b4496b5bb9e949b07.jpg","authentication":"992733a5351680fd83ccae369869cf52","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_taylor_e_bx_01_fl_001_01_021_o2.jpg","size":1384625,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2879,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044531440958152000708647477722479379735887050628662109375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170921"],"TimeCreated":["023109"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170921"],"TimeCreated":["023109"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170921"],"TimeCreated":["023109"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b689f3a83d55a84b4496b5bb9e949b07.jpg","FileDateTime":1509728441,"FileSize":1384625,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2879\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2879,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/9.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:09:21 14:56:15","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":9,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:09:21 02:31:09","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:09:21 02:31:09","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3259,"ExifImageLength":4074,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":200,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/200","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Needs Review","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Nothing else will compensate for it. \"Birds of a feather will flock together.\" On the other hand let a christian society take no notice of the higher class of monuments where cultured people operate refuse to spend their time on money to further its interests, may well wonder and ought to be astonished that so few cultured and wealthy persons are received into its Communion.

Here the office was filled with Engineers firemen belonging to the Brotherhood. Mr Bush one of the Committee arrived today from Downers Grove. he said \"the boys will fight it out this time\". Mr Arthur's rooms are filled with a good many new comers. The Engineers and Firemen are very careful what they have to say to strangers. There will be new men here tonight from Galesburg, also some delegates from New York to see what they can do to help the brotherhood. At 9 P.M. Opr discontinued the operation.

Reports that while among the Strikers today he made the following discovery.  That: a striker by the name of Wood has given up Rail Roading and gone to farming.  A Striking Engineer named Wilson is trying to sell his place on Broadway.  Opt. saw Quinlan Bayon, Snow and Raymond in Sieberts Saloon.  Opt watched Koegel a long time at different places  At Heecks we had a discussion about the Illinois Central leaving the Tracks of the A.? line, when Horley accidentally stepped on a match Koegel said Ah Tom.   You are using Dynamite   Horly said yes but I dont take it to my room and the all laughed.  Opt says he can get into any of the Strikers Conversations but they are all about Ball Games or somthing besides the strike  There were but few Strikers on the streets Tom Barry, Horley were on the streets till after 12.

I first went to the Landlady and after asking for McClean was told that he was not in the house. I told her I thought he would sleep all day as he seldom works in the day, but only at night, she said he was generally there until dinner time and then remained around outside. She sent her little girl out to call McClean and when he came in I asked him if he was Mr. McClean and he said he was, I told him that I had been informed that I could find him around Sugar Grove and that I would like a ? to represent the Land Co. out toward Sugar Grove and other places in the western part of this County. He said that he did not care to work that way at all. I asked him what he had been doing & he said he was looking after things of interest to Railroad Co. at present. I asked him if it paid well and he said enough to satisfy him I asked him if he worked day or night and he replied 'at night' I told him that he did not need ,much sleep as the lady of the house said that","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":96334,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/96334","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/e1ca850905d08f3170781457011f4e9a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/e1ca850905d08f3170781457011f4e9a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/e1ca850905d08f3170781457011f4e9a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e1ca850905d08f3170781457011f4e9a.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T21:41:02+00:00","modified":"2020-09-03T21:59:11+00:00","filename":"e1ca850905d08f3170781457011f4e9a.jpg","authentication":"2e03f98929f46c9cac8c211b44ca18f2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"cbq_033_1880_09_box_106_fl_812_033_004_o2.jpg","size":1105356,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2308,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044344791064895},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20181009"],"TimeCreated":["002536"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["887766"],"Source":["CB&Q 33 1880 9 Box 106"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20181009"],"TimeCreated":["002536"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["887766"],"Source":["CB&Q 33 1880 9 Box 106"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20181009"],"TimeCreated":["002536"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["887766"],"Source":["CB&Q 33 1880 9 Box 106"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e1ca850905d08f3170781457011f4e9a.jpg","FileDateTime":1586727529,"FileSize":1105356,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2308\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2308,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/10.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:10:10 11:37:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":10,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:10:09 00:25:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:10:09 00:25:36","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6.643856,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2930,"ExifImageLength":4570,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1221,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1221","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"he did not sleep much during the day.

There was quite a number of men and girls at the house and they danced and playd games. Opr. got into a conversation with Olson & two other men about the strike.

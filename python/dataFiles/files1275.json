Monday March 15th. \n I can assure you, or you can well imagine that I wanted to go up to Milo dreadfully, but could in no manner attain to it, as I was already one day behind my time, and if I remained even a single day longer, should probably have lost the whole concern of my school.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101871,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101871","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/fc798bb5177171295a836327f525e663.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/fc798bb5177171295a836327f525e663.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/fc798bb5177171295a836327f525e663.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fc798bb5177171295a836327f525e663.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:39:31+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"fc798bb5177171295a836327f525e663.jpg","authentication":"df615c91798dd7bb82c33ae07c9f62e3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_160_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1815154,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2835,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.059283885296230999506494896422736928798258304595947265625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233316"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233316"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233316"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"fc798bb5177171295a836327f525e663.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994750,"FileSize":1815154,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2835\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2835,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 11:58:28","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:33:16","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:33:16","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3121,"ExifImageLength":3962,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"If I could only have known that I was coming this way, or thought of it a week sooner, I should have started in season to have made a visit to Milo, and been present upon the \"Momentous Occasion\" as Joseph calls it.

especially if one does not hear at all from former acquaintances; and I had been here almost a fortnight before I hear a single word from Milo, or from my other home & Mother's \"Old Boudoir\", where I had left many things from which I was anxious to hear from. \nIf I thought that Lucy @, or would be a Bangor, I think I should go down there Fast Day.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101874,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101874","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/adde6943cb004121056097bd5b5c3a4f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/adde6943cb004121056097bd5b5c3a4f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/adde6943cb004121056097bd5b5c3a4f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/adde6943cb004121056097bd5b5c3a4f.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:39:35+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"adde6943cb004121056097bd5b5c3a4f.jpg","authentication":"a43a5af9b9dce0e59ad19c227d0c9d1f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_160_003_002_o2.jpg","size":1804236,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2846,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058699539314436999237756253933184780180454254150390625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233348"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233348"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233348"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"adde6943cb004121056097bd5b5c3a4f.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994750,"FileSize":1804236,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2846\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2846,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 11:58:41","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:33:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:33:48","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3122,"ExifImageLength":3948,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"You can hardly imagine how impatient I am to be able to go to Milo;

I have got one of the very best and very pleasantest schools that ever was seen. I have about forty five scholars, and most of them very good ones, some very forward. About twenty of them are young ladies grown up, and such are altogether the best scholars generally, if one knows how to get along with them just right. They are easiest to govern, that is, if they need any governing; have a much better sense of propriety than young men generally, less of that stubborn independence in wrong oftener than right, which leads young men and their teachers into so much trouble. They are also easier to interest in studies or anything good, though perhaps to be fare, less likely to retain an interest if once excited, but with less to distract the mind. Most of my best classes are mostly young ladies. Another thing will perhaps amuse you -- my school is closed every day with singing! Pretty well, considering my musical capacities, is it not? The young ladies do it entirely among themselves, and it succeeds finely. Some eight or ten of them, are superior singers, the best part of two or three village choirs. I think it is a fine thing for the school, and pleases the scholars finely. It tends to cultivate and strengthen a good feeling among them.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101875,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101875","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d8c18af3f36b35cafc8035174e6c4056.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d8c18af3f36b35cafc8035174e6c4056.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d8c18af3f36b35cafc8035174e6c4056.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d8c18af3f36b35cafc8035174e6c4056.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:39:36+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"d8c18af3f36b35cafc8035174e6c4056.jpg","authentication":"91af6fa164477cb2e4b0a1d0277e2d5b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_160_003_003_o2.jpg","size":1850636,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2796,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0612858316112969980782310130962287075817584991455078125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233351"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233351"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233351"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d8c18af3f36b35cafc8035174e6c4056.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994750,"FileSize":1850636,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2796\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2796,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 11:58:45","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:33:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:33:51","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":54,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3093,"ExifImageLength":3982,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"It will certainly be extremely convenient for me if Charles can furnish me with some seventy five or one hundred dollars in June or July.

Guess old Frost in Topsham would, perhaps somebody in Bangor would; perhaps the Colburns here in Orono would; and, if I have my health and strength, and God blesses me as he has done, I could soon earn money and pay it. But, then, I am twenty five years old already; the most valuable portion of my life is fast passing away; and I ought not to be obliged to spend the prime of my strength, physical or intellectual, in some temporary employment to earn money to pay debts!\nStill, all that, one way or the other, does not trouble me much. I can earn money any time, or do without. What does trouble me, is -- What shall I do in the world? I ought to have some fixed object in view to lend all my energies towards. What shall it be? You might say the ministry-- but I am not fit for it, and in more respects than one or two; should not be successful in it, in any respect. I think I might be successful as a Physician or Surgeon; that my mind would be fitted for it, etc. perhaps. But it is by far the most expensive of all professions, to study as I should want to.

But the way is here, all begin to go to school; but as soon as the warm weather comes on, and the river opens, the young men begin to leave, some to work in the Mills & about the water etc. etc., and some because the want to play out doors, and their parents cannot keep them in etc. etc.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101880,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101880","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c7325fb843321c68a691a24adf00e2a1.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c7325fb843321c68a691a24adf00e2a1.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c7325fb843321c68a691a24adf00e2a1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c7325fb843321c68a691a24adf00e2a1.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:39:43+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"c7325fb843321c68a691a24adf00e2a1.jpg","authentication":"59c29953853d267dd93dc4ca72847987","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_160_004_003_o2.jpg","size":1766579,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2801,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058397761381516997969409743518554023467004299163818359375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233419"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233419"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233419"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c7325fb843321c68a691a24adf00e2a1.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994750,"FileSize":1766579,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2801\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2801,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 11:59:03","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:34:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:34:19","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":27,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3090,"ExifImageLength":3971,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"So they say that I have done unusually well in the school up in numbers so well and so long, and yet I have lost just about one half of the young men who began to attend. \n\n One thing is flattering however, that not a single one of the young ladies has left except one who is sick.

Of course, the Insurance is good for exactly nothing at all. Numerous instances show it conclusively. How foolish it is to be there paying money for what is worse than nothing. Moreover that property ought to be insured, You would all of you be badly off if those buildings were consumed and you had nothing to rebuild with. To say nothing of you creditors, for whose interested you ought to think somewhat. \n\nMoreover. it will of course do no good to make a transfer of property with the same policy. There must be a new policy of insurance, ought to be in name of A.M. Metcalf, then to be transferred to C.W. Rich whenever the property affairs are settled, which they surely ought to be. \nAs for how those things should be settled, I am sure I do not know, Charles thinks one third part of the farm is not worth more than about $500,00 I do not know as it is a real estate in valued there now. I ought to be though. Real estate must be surprisingly low in Milo. Any where in Foxcroft or Dover the same property would be worth at least three times as much, and is there fast rising too. It must rise a good deal in Milo before many years I should think.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101884,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101884","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/eba19e3f99f5b8fee06f0cd23246d5ed.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/eba19e3f99f5b8fee06f0cd23246d5ed.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/eba19e3f99f5b8fee06f0cd23246d5ed.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/eba19e3f99f5b8fee06f0cd23246d5ed.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:39:49+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"eba19e3f99f5b8fee06f0cd23246d5ed.jpg","authentication":"ec0daa96c7da56803196046ce216c047","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_160_005_003_o2.jpg","size":1776879,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2793,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058906492421530003145146991982983308844268321990966796875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233445"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233445"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233445"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"eba19e3f99f5b8fee06f0cd23246d5ed.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994750,"FileSize":1776879,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2793\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2793,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 11:59:12","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:34:45","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:34:45","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":93,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3093,"ExifImageLength":3986,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"If the Real Estate is estimated at $500,00, the whole personal property would amount to something over $200,00 or $300 more I should suppose.

Coll. July 18th, 1847\nDear Mother,\nYou can hardly imagine how much I was gratified at receiving yesterday a letter from Milo, I had almost begun to doubt the existence of any such place, or at least of any people dwelling there. I had been in Brunswick six full weeks, and had heard never a word from there, although I had written two or three times I believe. However, perhaps I was glad enough at receiving the letter at last to make up for some of the waiting.  However if it is to be so long before I receive answers to letters, I think I do well to write pretty soon after receiving one.\nAs for my health, about which you always appear to feel so much anxiety, I have the pleasure of informing you that I never enjoyed better in my life. I am perfectly well, stout, rugged, and healthy, eat like an ox, and sleep accordingly; can tire out my fellows at most any thing, and not worry me; swim three hours per diem, (if I choose), and feel all the better for it.  On the whole, I study some, read more, and get along very comfortably, except when some unlucky circumstance slightly reminds me of pecuniary affairs; but even that, for one as good natured & careless as I am, never lasts a great while.

But by mistake of my Landlord, or rather of his porters, my valise in the morning went the wrong way, and I could not go until too late. However, the gentlemanly Landlord, Mr. Coe, made many apologies, and told me to stop till Monday, free of expense. So I staid, and Saturday, called round to see the people.\nCalled at Mrs. Childs, her health improving. She has not been very well, her daughters pretty good for her.

Took the cars for Worcester with Humphrey Stevens who was going on to Albany, as his man Alby had by Telegraphic dispatch requested. He had a great journey, though the Western States last year, 15000 miles 11 1\/2 months.\nFrom Worcester by Northfield & Brattleboro Stage to Warwick by way of Barre Petersham. Of all the enough country that ever I heard of it beats every thing. The road itself not very lively, but more crooked than ten Earhorns, away round one awful rocky, little hill, then leaping over to just such an then, to mind round to still another in the same way: and soon all day long! Not an acre of land to be seen! but still abundance of farming and orcharding, on little spots of Earth, mashed into hallows among the rocks & ledges. I got out of the stage at a Mr. M. Williams, the nearest point to Warwick village, following a map of \"Road to Capt. Joe's\" projected upon my note book by H. Stevens Esq. Uncle Joseph not at home, Greenfield. However, they appeared glad to see me. All well. Next day, Tuesday, 7th, I went up to Aunt Conants; staid all day. They are all well. Hervey has quite a pretty little wife and two children, and just going next day have now gone, all four, to Barnard, Vermont, to see Samuel. Aunt C.

I went with Samuel up to the other place, and up where Father used to live. Every thing seemed to look just as I could remember it, only smaller, narrower, and as if crowded up together, the houses seemed so near, instead of away off as I thought them. I went into the house, the Old Kitchen seemed so little. I suppose I remember it as it seems to me when I used to creep across its floor, and think it a long ways. Mr. Newton, who lives there has had a stroke of palsy, and cannot speak so as to be understood or hardly more about. The farm I guess is not very well cultivated, or any thing in good repair. They say it is exactly as father left it. No Improvement of course going backward. The farther part of the shed building is all rotted down, looks as if five pounds weight would crumble it. Samuel & I called at Mr. Russell Morse's, Sen. & Jun. My old playmate has two or three stout babies! The Old Man, Samuel said is Rich. We went back across. What a tremendous hill that is. After supper, Samuel carried me over to Mr. Obediah Stoddards, whose wife Esther, it appears is my Cousin, though I knew nothing of her, or she of me. She has got a pretty little girl though.

They say that I am sure of employment on this road sometime - The Chief Engineer Edwards, has told me there is no doubt of it. But there great things more slow you know. They have just concluded to go on with a great deal of business this Fall -- when they get ready - And Engineers are Scarce. This Vermont R.R. is to be pressed in not only to Brattleboro, but far beyond, up river, Bellows Fall & I don't know where else. And above all that The Directors of this Road, and of Fitchburg, and others have decided to make immediately a great survey for a route from this Road say from Brattleboro, across the Mountains to Troy N.Y.  4 or 5 thousands $ have been already appropriated for the preparatory survey, exploration","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101900,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101900","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d1e916c6a0d4180fb3fd106dd3597bca.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d1e916c6a0d4180fb3fd106dd3597bca.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d1e916c6a0d4180fb3fd106dd3597bca.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d1e916c6a0d4180fb3fd106dd3597bca.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:40:12+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"d1e916c6a0d4180fb3fd106dd3597bca.jpg","authentication":"dd875de0e0e3705150ddc9775ab1f41b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_160_008_003_o2.jpg","size":1883203,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2915,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.059818404167461002030048433653064421378076076507568359375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233609"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233609"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233609"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d1e916c6a0d4180fb3fd106dd3597bca.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994751,"FileSize":1883203,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2915\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2915,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 11:59:48","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:36:09","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:36:09","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":59,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3342,"ExifImageLength":4127,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Just how they are all waiting for some formal action of Directors of something or other.

However, considering the circumstances, and the important events, which have lately transpired, there is some apology for the delay in this last case. I think though that I ought to have been apprised of the great fact a week sooner. Seemed to me I want to see the young gentleman. What will they call his name? Charles? Of course. Couldn't find a better, except it were\u00a0! Isaac!!! How does Charles ensure his dignity? How I should like to be there to admire his paternity. Why couldn't you tell me how the little fellow looks? Or has in that matter been decided yet?! It is a little curious that Charles should be away in the woods. Rather a great idea to find himself a father so unexpectedly. I do not see how he can go back into the woods again and leave his baby! It is a pity I had not his oxen here if that is all that sends him off. $28.00m per month thought I should think was doing pretty well, all expenses paid; that is, if he gets his pay.

Besides, they ought to be ready to given me free passes over some Railroads by that time.\n The fact is, at any rate there is no sort of necessity on propriety in you keeping yourself shut up there at Milo, at the rate you have done for so long.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101903,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101903","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/dda1c310fb38662fbc3627547fd4fffb.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/dda1c310fb38662fbc3627547fd4fffb.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/dda1c310fb38662fbc3627547fd4fffb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/dda1c310fb38662fbc3627547fd4fffb.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:40:17+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"dda1c310fb38662fbc3627547fd4fffb.jpg","authentication":"af4aedaddb01a172a3ea8a547776ef79","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_161_002_001_o2.jpg","size":1586713,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2338,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0628391233406200011568643049031379632651805877685546875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233652"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233652"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233652"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"dda1c310fb38662fbc3627547fd4fffb.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994751,"FileSize":1586713,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2338\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2338,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 11:59:59","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:36:52","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:36:52","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3270,"ExifImageLength":5035,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Sabbath Evening, March 5th, 1848, Northfield\nDear Mother. I believe I much begin to write again to you and Lucy for it I want after writing once even till I receive your letter; the time becomes so long that I almost forget even writing before \"The Stormy March had come at last!\" After a winter of almost unexampled mildness, very little snow, no sleighing for a week together any time I believe, hardly any cold weather except a week or two we were out up to Brattleboro; March bids fair to be; at any rate had thus for shown itself, boisterous enough.\n\n Today had been real March weather: changing half a dozen times from bright melting sunshine, to dark gusty snow storms, and a wind that cuts like a knife, raising the snow in clouds, even as it melts under the high Spring Sun.\n    At the Monthly concert - this afternoon, Dea. Field from another town being present, gave an interesting account of a Revival, lately & now, going on in the town of Heath, west part of this county. \nA real Revival, like those of other days, which have been so scarce almost unknown for there or four years past. How it does warm ones' thoughts, so that, according to the Psalmist, the fire burns within, to hear again such doing of the Lord. I bought back to my mind the former days, at Brownville in 1842.\n Oh that the Lord would again vouchsafe to visit his people in Mercy to extend gracious influences of his spirit on every side. How careful too ought Christians to be lest they again excite the displeasure of God as in time past.\n The Churches about here, I think must be in extremely bad state; far worse than I know any thing about Down East. Many of them as I hear full of old breaches, divisions, wounds, & some that will not be healed up: often hearing called council after council, and every one leaning matters worse then before. This Church has been in the same way, and that long: difficulties now sleep perhaps only because there is not life enough to show it. As the man who is struck down by apoplexy does not complain of a foul stomach. As I understand from Mr. Jones, there has never been really a revival of Religion in this town! One of the oldest towns too. Mr. Field said that in Heath there have been 10 councils besides References in 10 years.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101904,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101904","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/68fe7ad3a6cefddb880c80c367124d9a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/68fe7ad3a6cefddb880c80c367124d9a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/68fe7ad3a6cefddb880c80c367124d9a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/68fe7ad3a6cefddb880c80c367124d9a.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:40:18+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"68fe7ad3a6cefddb880c80c367124d9a.jpg","authentication":"629426a60f9b8723b6dc933fb120b140","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_161_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1580001,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2332,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.06273430055269700600373283805311075411736965179443359375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233656"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233656"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233656"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"68fe7ad3a6cefddb880c80c367124d9a.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994751,"FileSize":1580001,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2332\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2332,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:00:01","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:36:56","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:36:56","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":74,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3255,"ExifImageLength":5023,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Isaac Mar. 6, 1848\nThere are great times just now among the Irish laborers along the Rail Roads about here. Wages have been this winder &.70 per day for shovellers. That is little enough to be sure considering that they may not be able to work more then 15 or 20 days in a month and their board costs them generally about $2.25 or more per week. But since March came in, and the wages not raised, they have had a general \"Strike for higher wages!\" all along on this Road and others simultaneously. Not content with stopping work themselves, you see, they undertake to all from working whether they wish or not; marching along the line sometimes three of four hundred together armed with clubs & pick handles, stopping the crews who did not strike, in some instances, destroying cards, shovels, etc. Most of the works about here stopped when the rest did, but as yet there have been no overt acts. Some think the mobs will show themselves here within a few days, to break up the crews who are still at work on the bridges etc. No one knows what will be. One of the bridge contractors, who has a crew still at work down on Miller's River, had armed himself with two or three \"Revolvers\" declaring that no one shall drive his men off the works. He is a resolute fellow too.\n\nI think now I shall continue some way to get off here a week or two the last of April or in May. I rather think they will let me go, if they are not extremely and unusually hurried. I have certainly been very steady at business since I have been here and indeed am in such a situation that they owe it to me. Moreover, those with whom I have to do are the best  sort of men to get along with. Mr. Field my immediate director is a great friend of me, and ready to do any thing to oblige me; and Mr. Johnson, the Chief Engineer, has the reputation of being very obliging in such matters. To be sure, leave of absence for an Engineer is something not usual or to be expected. The universal answer to applications is No. If a Junior ever gets leave of absence it is a special favor. It is a kind or work that cannot stop and no one can take another place for a few days or a week. However, you may fairly expect Me; so of course Mother be ready to come back with me at once.

I believe it is pretty near a month since I wrote last. Does it begin to look any like Farming Down East yet? Folks hear abouts have begun to plough a little. and prepare Gardens, in dry situations. The frost is pretty well out of the Ground, the Road considerably settled, the grass is springing, the buds swelling. The rye fields, (rye appears to be a principal crop here) look beautifully Green.\nFrogs, snakes, and birds are abundant this fortnight. Blue birds are extremely abundant & little shy; Robins more scarce than in Maine. I think. Since the first of April I have been out of doors all the time, indeed of about half, and enjoy it much. There is prospect of rather a busy time next month; but then I am getting work done up pretty good jog, that is may be in a state of forwardness, so I can get away. Did you ever know any thing about this town of Northfield; Mother, when you lived in Milo? I believe it would be difficult to find any where, a more idle, shiftless, good for nothing, vicious, set of people than are to be found in this street. Mr. Fields, and he, like most perhaps who call themselves Unitarians, is really little better than an Infidel; Mr. Field ascribes the present character of the inhabitants to the \"preaching\" under which they were brought up. I think lately that might be the case. Did you ever know of, or hear of , \"Old Priest Mason.\"  He was dismissed from the Church here several years since, still lives here, but has never entered the Church from that day till this.

He is an intemperance man. uses it himself, owns, leases, and supports a miserable Irish Grog Shop. Mr. Birnie, the Bridge Contractor has tried every way to hire or buy the whole premises, for the trouble it makes to him and his men; but the old reprobate wont. Quite a proportion of the people I judge to be fit followers for such a head.  I have found but two or three younger men of Northfield, that I would call decently respected anywhere else.\n\n  I do not know but I ought to tell you the story of my fit of sickness and my getting drunk lately.  It may make you talk to me about being careful of my health.  Though in fact, I am never careless; in proof of which, I can say I have not taken a cold at all for the winter or spring.  I usually have a cold sometime latter part of the winter; but this year have entirely escaped; and my health has been perfect: ~ but ~ about a week since I had a sort of Nervous fever which lasted two or three days, in which time I did not sleep, and hardly rested still in one place one whole minute at a time. There was a terrible burning much of the time in my face, alternated by a dull pain among my teeth & cheek bones. Perhaps, you know I am a Hydropathist. Well, I could cure the symptoms quite easily by the regular water cure, laying cloths from cold water over my face etc. but I could not thus remove the cause, the nerves, and the fever would return. At last I got out of patience, went to the doctor, took a good dose of Chloroform, got pretty drunk, calmed my nerves down, went to sleep, and waked up perfectly well.  On the whole it was quite a fit of sickness for me. was not it?\n Isn't this an early Spring? or is it earlier here than in Maine? I picked a nice bunch of May Flowers today 13th  Farmers busy ploughing etc .\n\nAny sort of a decent horse is worth $100.00 here. 6 1\/2 fat cattle 90. to 100. Tell Charles whether he does any thing else or not this year to do something about Orcharding. I believe good orchards may be on the Intervale profitably.

This Cutting down, \"razeeing\", a ship builder might call it, a man from \"second rate\" to \"third rate\", is not very easily estimated.

But with us Common men the case is very different. If the student was not quite high enough for a \"Phi Beta-Kappa\", nothing he can ever do afterwards will give him an Election and if he does not get higher than a \"Common Man's\" ambition ought to lead him, then will be apt to remember what he was not, rather what he is.

But then that cannot heed so much help at the end you know have been lately turning off some, more will be without doubt before the road is complete. To be sure, they tell me I shall probably be wanted as long as any one; and perhaps I may; as I believe I have made myself pretty useful for my standing & salary: Still I cannot expect always to be favored, even at the expense of those who have friends to book out for them. The Question is, what had I better do? My object of course is to get ahead as fast as possible. Can I do better than to go South, if I can get an opportunity?

Since I received yours however, I have another letter from Joseph two days since: he states that she has already left Bangor, that Charles & Almeda were down to see here. I confess, I seemed to know nothing about it; and her leaving Bangor seemed rather strange to me.

From the date it seems that it was written about a month ago. It is however little more than a week since I received it; it probably waited by the way some at Bangor or Hampden, and then as I had changed my residence, it was most a week after it arrived at Northfield probably before I obtained it.  I believe I have written to you once since your letter was written though I suppose you had not then received it. I guess I wrote before they moved me off here to Grout's: perhaps about the time I was thinking about Alabama! I guess I wrote all that story. Well Leonard went off to Alabama, & I was promoted to his place. No slight mark of confidence to be placed in a young Engineer, only a year old! to put him in such a situation.   It wasn't a very pleasant situation to begin with though. It is never a very easy business getting into another man's shoes. Engineering is perhaps most difficult of all business for that: and to Cap the Climax Leonard was about as hard a man to follow as could be found. I expect they put me here thinking I could along with it if anybody could! but I assure you it was a hard case for a spell. Much as ever I couldn't sleep a'nights for a week or two. I could not dream of anything else. However patience diligence perseverance etc. etc. are bringing order out of chaos in some measure, & the prospect is now pretty fair of getting along quite comfortably this winter: though I maybe a good deal hurried & perhaps worried for a month or two.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101923,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101923","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/490bf881ff061447fc793785e465831c.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/490bf881ff061447fc793785e465831c.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/490bf881ff061447fc793785e465831c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/490bf881ff061447fc793785e465831c.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:40:45+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"490bf881ff061447fc793785e465831c.jpg","authentication":"85eab467cf90f243a96f9b032117cdfb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_161_009_002_o2.jpg","size":1903533,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2867,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.061476475603612003306697175730732851661741733551025390625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233907"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233907"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233907"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"490bf881ff061447fc793785e465831c.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994752,"FileSize":1903533,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2867\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2867,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:00:45","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:39:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:39:07","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3127,"ExifImageLength":3926,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"As for Politics, your letter was so long delayed, it did not reach me until just about Election time; If it had come sooner, I should certainly have written off as fast as possible to Charles upon that subject, for it really hurt my feelings considerable that a brother of mine should aid in the Election of such a man as Zachary Taylor. To be sure, it is no more than we must expect, that the thousands will be led around by by the nose, by party leaders, but then we do not like to see our friends served so. It is really astonishing to see what power over the multitude some of these old party prejudices, obsolete part watchwords, and such ideas as this \"must keep out Cas\" etc. do have. I hardly know which is the worst for the many to be so blinded & gulled, and by those too who will laugh at them for it when it is over; or for such men as Webster 'understanding the whole so fully, seeing the crime & the cheat, even acknowledging it so plainly: to be so driven in, whipped in, or as many say, absolutely bought & bribed in, to the support, of it can be called support, of a party; to so eat his own words, almost to eat himself.\n\n  It is astonishing what money can do - even with Genius, especially when it happens to be poor as Webster is.\n\nOne other thing, as for this \"Must have Taylor or Cass.\" I would certainly very much prefer Cass to Taylor. You could hardly find a Mass. Whig who would not except for this one thing. Taylor is the Whig 'so called' Candidate; forty thousand it seems did not care even for that.\n\nTo be sure I regard Cass as equally unprincipled as Taylor,  but then I can but put infinitely more confidence in his future course. With all such men conducts depends upon influences, as true as ethics.

Just think how I have got along in Engineering, considering my beginning, without favor, patronage, influence or any thing. Circumstances have all seemed to work together just exactly right to give me the best chance to learn to do,  and to do all kinds of business; And then now just the right vacancy to occur right before me, and confidence enough placed in me to just crowd me right up into it and sustain one there.  Before, as Leveller all along back, I have had the work to do, with somebody else behind me to tell me how to do it, and to be responsible for it. Now I am to go on and do it myself and tell others how to do it.  Mr. Field when he comes along down here now does not tell me what to do as he used to, but asks me how I am going to have such a peice of work done; what I am going to put here or there, or advises me what to do.

I got a big letter from Bangor today. Joseph, Lucy & Samuel. I haven't heard from Anne yet since she reached Racine, expect to soon. Lucy had a letter just before she wrote to me.\n\n Lucy & Samuel have taken it into their heads to give me abundant advice to the effect \"get married\"! What is it best to do about it? They like it so well they think every body else must. The trouble is, they go only half way. their advice is too general. they say \"Marry\": the question is \"whom?\" Lucy leaves me very much in doubt whether her preference would be for Olive Furber, or Lizzie Doe! What do you think of her taste? I do not know but my taste would be rather a hard one to suit: though after all I am a little inclined to think that there is not so much difference: that whoever the parties, the fault is one's own if not suited in the end. Characters are moulded to the circumstances & companions they meet with, in great measure, spite of Story & romance.\n      As respects Society & every thing of that kind, my position is certainly very far from favorable: it was bad enough at Northfield Since I came down here I have gone up to Northfield on Sabbath 9 miles, on Sat. night: but believe I shall go over to Montague only, 4 miles in future mostly. \n My present Post Office Direction is \"Grouts\" on Grouts Corner, Mass. \n\nPerhaps I better not tell you what sort of a place it is: nor how the Tavern, our boarding house, has 50 boarders, 20 beds, & a Dining Room that seats 15! However I am very comfortable. \"The Engineer\" has a large room, perhaps the last in the house. It is R.R. Office, filled of course with Drawing tables, books, tools & paper, & has two beds, one for me, one for my two Assistants. But you know we do as we choose, furnish us or room with whatever we like, & Vt. & Mass. pays the bills! The great thing for me, plenty of best Sperm Candles.\nOne thing Grouts is better than Northfield; it has no idlers. \nDo write soon, frequently, often.\nLove to All,\nWrite me about all.   JJvJ?

To prevent me from doing or feeling worse I believe I will continue the business by beginning at least a letter to you.\n As for you apprehensions of evil in my behalf, I guess there is little reason. The \"Glory\" of being at Grouts I should hardly think could injure any one. As for health, it is very possible that since being here, I may have somewhat overworked body or rather Mind, and am just now feeling the natural reaction. At any rate I feel rather dull stupid & sleepy for a day or two. I expect I have got the Jaundice a bit. Notice that I look about as yaller as a yellow dog today, and about as dull as a  beetle.\n\nthis Jaundice is a disease indigeneous to this Miserable Miller's River. At any rate prevalent here. something perhaps in the soil, air, or water. I do not like the place.  \n\n  Ann certainly seems to be very comfortable & happy in her new & far off situation.

I presume that it will be strictly followed: though my predecessor got married here! to a sister of the tavernkeeper's wife who waited on the tables ignorant & coarse too. but so was he in many respects.\nReally though I begin to \"take it to heart\", among the Multitude of Councilors. Not only Lucy & Samuel, I could get round that; but you & Joseph, and now even Anne, away from Wisconsin.

There may be some that want me: but that is quite a different matter.  There was a young lady in Turner that I could have liked considerable, perhaps did; but she was engaged to a young Engineer before I ever saw her; a friend of mine, and I couldn't in honor \"cut him out,\" as the chaps say. They are Married, a year since, I couldn't go to the wedding: was? in N.H. He is Sec. Eng. on the Portsmouth & Concord R.R. She is a grand woman, & one of the best friends I have got any where. She had a sister younger & prettier I suppose than \"Nancy\"; who was perhaps designed for me: A very good girl too: but then I never liked her as well as she me. I never repented much more of any little accident, than I have of kissing her cheek one particular time. It hurt me when I heard how she cried when I did not go back to Turner to teach the next Fall.\n\n I do not know as there is any body else in all \"Down East\" that I care much for. Josephine of Topsham too, whom Anne once recommended to me, was engaged to my particular friend Morse, before I ever met with her.\n\nI have certainly met no very \"bright particular\" Star since I have been in Mass. If I was most obliged to choose from so limited a field, I should feel rather sick. I guess it would have to be that Miss Dutton you perhaps saw when you were at Northfield. I guess she isn't but 17 years old, perhaps 18. She is  a good girl though and I like her folks first rate.  There, I believe I have made a \"clean breast\" on the subject of \"Matrimony\"!

June 17th 1849\nDear Mother\n\n                        It seems to me I do not hear from you very often lately: and when you do write, it is too often only a few lines, on the corner of a letter. When I was at Warwick, Uncle Joseph complained of you for not writing, and accused you of \"getting lazy\". I took it upon myself to deny the charge quite indignantly: but I do not know but I shall be obliged to \"retract\". if you do not write to me better than lately. To be sure I do not know but I am partly to blame myself. Not being an \"original genius\" or having like Joseph any original ideas. I can only write letters by answering the letters of others. Of course my letters are apt to be directed to those who wrote to me last. \n\nI believe I have been a pretty punctual correspondent to Joseph and Lucy who wrote to me usually pretty punctually.\n\n I have not much to write now that will be of interest. The life of an Engineer, though to be sure full of variety, is of that kind of Minute Variety that hardly bears copying or transferring to a letter. Perhaps it would be called a monotonous variety. \n\nOne may ride or walk a few miles farther one day than another meet a few more folks, or be a little more hurried, quarrel with a contractor or agent one day, and find him good natured and obsequious the next; but it is all hardly worth telling of.\n\n I am really rather pleasantly situated here this summer.

I worked so well along in the Spring that I do not have to be so much hurried now a days. I can get along pretty easy, considerable care, but not a great deal to do at present except Office Work, and riding about to give directions and see that they are done right in all respects. I can not get away now on account of some Masonry which require constant looking after to have it done right. If I get that fixed up right after the First of August Work is done up, if nothing else comes up which is probably, perhaps I can get away for a week.\n As for Joseph, I think he reads writes & thinks too much. Why can he not be contented to simply enjoy life without vexing his brain for any thing just for one season Load round, ride about and lie in the sun not read & write all the time. It is a great pity he could not come. I would have taken care of him good.\nThe Weather here has been extremely hot, and very dry ground all parched up.  Hay only half a crop.

Now Joseph is gone, I can see no possible reason why you cannot write often. When he was at home we supposed you had considerable to do to take care of him, and made that an excuse for not writing.  Joseph's going away to Waterford was really quite unexpected to me. To be sure he made something about it, but I hardly though he was in earnest: until the first I knew of it, I received a letter from Waterford. He has written to me twice since he arrived there. He bore the journey it seems much better than I had supposed he would. In fact, I believe he & Eliab, (from whom I have just heard) both think the journey did him good. I guess he finds himself very pleasantly situated at Waterford, and with some very pleasant acquaintances, especially  that Mr. Isaiah Dole, Joseph's old Teacher at Foxcroft, whom he liked so well, you know \n\nI got a letter from him yesterday. He says he doesn't hardly dare to say certain, but has a notion that he can perceive an improvement since he has been there.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101940,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101940","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/63eefc8e46761113ff8d48d0aae84108.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/63eefc8e46761113ff8d48d0aae84108.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/63eefc8e46761113ff8d48d0aae84108.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/63eefc8e46761113ff8d48d0aae84108.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:41:10+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"63eefc8e46761113ff8d48d0aae84108.jpg","authentication":"7db3cb2111b4381f2c42ca754c0f5c06","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_162_014_002_o2.jpg","size":1683465,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2925,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053291073124406000693920049116059090010821819305419921875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234124"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234124"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234124"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"63eefc8e46761113ff8d48d0aae84108.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994753,"FileSize":1683465,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2925\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2925,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:01:28","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:41:24","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:41:24","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3196,"ExifImageLength":3933,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I wish I could get away to go there and visit him while there but it hardly seems possible for me to get away at present.\n\n  A letter from Lucy lately.

Jan. 5, 1850\nDear Mother\n\n   I received your kind letter yesterday I think after expecting it a good while. Of course I need not say how much good \"Mother's Letter\" always do me.\n I am really glad to hear that you are going to Hampden, for I do believe that you will enjoy a visit there. I am by no means sure that you ought not to spend most of your time with Lucy. You could not help being happier with her than with Albina.  If so you certainly should; for I know of nothing in the World to confine you in any place, but where your children are. I believe you think you are growing old. Now I think moving about is much more essential for Old folks than for the young: they ought to spend their time mostly in visiting their children.\n Did you ever hear of an old proverb that Mothers always like their daughter's husbands better than their Son's wives?

A Nephew of Putnam of Dunbarton many years since, was totally disabled bu an injury to the back worse than Joseph's; was two or three years unable to move his limbs at all, at least half a dozen years unable to do anything at all, but gradually recovered, and  fully, so that he is now one of the smartest men there is any where.

So here I sit in this little old \"Chester House\" with the Mighty Missippi (it is certainly mighty now) washing to doorstep and porch; and thinking, thinking of you all Down East. How I do want to hear from you. I seems as if it had been several ages since I left Bangor, and I have not heard one word from any of you since I started.  I have been writing to some of you about every week. A fortnight ago from Chicago I sent off quite a package of letters. I wrote some at Springfield a week since but thought I need not send until I get to some fixed point. I mailed a letter to Bangor on the Steamboat Thursday I think, and one to Milo, since I reached Chester.\n\nI am detained here at Chester some three days. My destination is out East of here in Perry Co. some 50 miles or more perhaps from here on the Prairies. I believe I wrote to Eliab and to Milo to direct letters to Locust Hill. Letters so directed will doubtless reach there. It is the name of the place where our head quarters are to be probably; But the name of the Post Office I find is\n                                                                Mt. Hawkins, Perry Co. Ill.\n\nThe safest direction will probably be to Care of B.G. Roots Esq. Mt. Hawkins, Perry Co. Ill.\nThe name of the County you know is a essential requisite in the direction here.\nWhether I shall stay there more than a Month or so is very uncertain.  I cannot tell how I shall like, or what kind of a situation I shall have. I have to begin with only the promise of $65.00 per Month & expenses. If I stay shall probably have up to 100.  If I find the Climate does not agree with me I shall not stay at any rate. Southern Illinois has sometimes been considered unhealthy,  but it is probably only from the character of its population.  The section where I am going is considered one of the healthiest in the State in all respects.\n\n I came around here from Caledonia on Thursday last. The Steamer,a very splendid Kentucky Boat, Louisville & St. Louis Packet, \"Fawn\", broke a shaft about 20 miles below here, and after much delay, creeping along with one wheel, unable from disabled condition to make a landing, put me ashore in a small boat at Midnight, half a mile below the City or Village, every Village is an organized City here. Moreover the flood was over the Highway so as to make it extremely difficult reaching the Village any how. But Mr. N.

You would say enough to use up one completely at the East, one who had not been on a horse for 1\/2 doz. years perhaps.\nBut it did not hurt or tire me at all. They have splendid saddles out here, stuffed and quilted as soft as a Cushion, and then the saddle horses, trained to a gait, sort of Canter, very different from a hard trot.  They ride horseback almost altogether here, single wagons or buggies being very rare, and the roads used almost entirely for two horses very hard footing for one horse in the middle\n\n  I enjoyed the ride very much, beautiful country; part of the way along to high bluffs in sight of Missippi River; Corn 6 to 10 ft. high just travelling out, and  some only just out of the ground, Wheat mostly cut and poorly shooked up in the field.\n\nAbundant orchards, especially of peaches, some cherries. Road sides abounding in big blackberries which I could pick abundantly without dismounting.\nHowever there are some Evils, probably lest the country might be Paradise.\nIn the bushes every where abound what they call Wood ticks, much like a sheep tick, with a little white spot in the middle, who adhere and bite considerable.  None yet are what they call \"jiggers\" a little red thing about as big as the point of a Needle, found I learned to my sorrow among blackberry bushes etc. who burrow into or under the skin, occasioning considerable burning itching & pain, and a hard lunch or blotch, like that of a mosquitoe on a stranger, only much more so, and sometimes getting all over one.\n\n I was going out to Perry Co. Sat. but could not get fairly started and so wait until Monday, which makes rather dull staying here.\n\nEve. I have not been at Church all day today, in account of the rain, much black Illinois deep mud, long hill to climb etc. In fact I am told there were but 10 out this A.M. and even the minister did not go this P.M.  I have slept most of the time I believe!\n\n   My health is very good. The weather for a week or two past has been about the same as our warmest weather in N.E.  I sweat profusely as usual, and am much of the time very thirsty.  I do not know whether from drinking the river water, from restraining myself from drinking as much as I desire, or from the food of the Country, which is universally most abominably too much salted. The Main article of food is Bacon every where in Illinois, the whole half hog salted & smoked in a side, always very salt. And at public houses, steamboats etc. they make the beef just so salt! And drink Coffee, Coffee in vast quantities strong as lye, three times a day Coffee & Bacon are two necessaries of life to regular sucker.

The Dining Room has two windows, one on the right adjacent to the stairs and one on the far left. The Dining Room is separated by a door to the left to an area with a Bathroom measuring 6 X 9 with a Bath and Water Closet and window and it leads by a door to a Closet 4 X 9 which is accessible by a door to the Bedroom. The Closet has a window and a Wardrobe.  The Dining Room and Kitchen sit in the middle of the house at the back of it. The Kitchen (which has no measurements mentioned but appears in the diagram to be about 3\/4 the size of the Dining Room, has 2 Windows, a Door to the outside on the right, a Pantry, a Sink and Pump, and a small  Closet?. The Pantry also has a window and a door leading to the Dining Room near its far left window.]\n[Front Porch faces] Sidewalk and Middle Avenue Common\n[top of page and left side of building with Bedroom]  Alley? Avenue?\n[right of building with Sitting Room windows looking out to]   Garden etc.\nThat will give you perhaps some idea of it. The three West windows, towards the Avenue go down to the floor. The Parlor we do not use or furnish at all. On the Sitting Room, we have the carpet Samuel sent, and it looks finely, also Twenty dollar damask or trockatelle Curtains with gilt cornice & fittings. Instead of a sofa, we have got a pair of handsome divans, which with Melodeon, Whatnot Quartet, & chairs furnish it tolerably.   The bed room is the best room in the house, and we have got it comfortably furnished with damask curtains, large Mirror & Black Walnut Bedstead Bureau Commode etc.\nIn one corner of the BedRoom is a Marble top & bowl Washstand a fixture of the house, with both hot & cold water by a silver mounted fasset? head. And through a closet is a very convenient Bath Room with both hot and cold water at all times by simply turning a stop cock.\nThe rain water runs into a large tank in the back Chamber, before filling the large underground Cistern.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101978,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101978","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/698f94092183d209f536437b8681a9ba.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/698f94092183d209f536437b8681a9ba.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/698f94092183d209f536437b8681a9ba.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/698f94092183d209f536437b8681a9ba.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:42:01+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"698f94092183d209f536437b8681a9ba.jpg","authentication":"32965753883fc24754022b9fd37ed05b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_164_003_003_o2.jpg","size":1587208,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2638,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05571027433802300254939154910971410572528839111328125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234615"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234615"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234615"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"698f94092183d209f536437b8681a9ba.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994755,"FileSize":1587208,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2638\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2638,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:03:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:46:15","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:46:15","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":57,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2937,"ExifImageLength":4008,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"From the up chamber tank, pipes connect with a Copper Cylinder boiler, in the corner behind the kitchen stove,  which holds perhaps two or three barrels, and has an iron boiler pipe passing through the stove fire, so that the cylinder is kept full of hot water, which indeed does not get cool in all night.

Dec. 8- \n\n~ Dear Mother - How glad I should be to have you all upon Isaac's suggestion, and come here with Percie. We are enjoying ourselves and well as we could possibly have expected. The thoughts will come sometimes how happy we should have been- how happy little Mayo and Willie would have been - and then I am astonished & grieved at myself that I should for one moment lose sight of their far greater bliss & joy in the bright home above.\n Little Wilder is ? and happy all day long. He had only four teeth - has taken three or four steps alone, grows fat and strong every day though I do not think him any stronger now than before he was sick. I am so glad Percie is so well - Raspberry leave and pumpkin bread seemed to be very Effectual. Isaac seems much better than when we came here. I did feel very anxious indeed about him. I feared he would be really very sick before he would be well. It was wonderful that he was not much sicker after so much care. Anna is just as good as can be - she comes over almost every day & Hattie & Libby come after, and altogether we have nice times. The black spot to me is the thought of Isaac's going away. I should really take great comfort in thinking of the winter if this did come up so often before me, and I do not mean to be unhappy about this either if he is only well. I should think Samuel's rooms must be very pleasant. We found a number of things nice & convenient that were not changed - spice box etc. Samuel is very thoughtful & kind.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101980,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101980","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f2c7a014b0d7beffb71c4b4b165e2800.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f2c7a014b0d7beffb71c4b4b165e2800.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f2c7a014b0d7beffb71c4b4b165e2800.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f2c7a014b0d7beffb71c4b4b165e2800.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:42:04+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"f2c7a014b0d7beffb71c4b4b165e2800.jpg","authentication":"decd73b306b76e2f3443add1111dfdfb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_164_004_001_o2.jpg","size":1767610,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2718,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.060216185648488997073091155698421061970293521881103515625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234634"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234634"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234634"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f2c7a014b0d7beffb71c4b4b165e2800.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994755,"FileSize":1767610,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2718\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2718,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:03:14","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:46:34","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:46:34","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2982,"ExifImageLength":3949,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Isaac\n                                                                                                               Elyria Lorain Co.

In one week from the time you were sickest, you were sitting up all day; and writing us a letter too. We have been much afraid you would be 'too smart', and get tired, or take cold, and not get on so fast for it.

I want to see they do not do us any mischief by any action about cross or connecting lines of Rail Roads in this part of the State.\n I wrote a long letter to you since I came from Elyria; probably near the same time that you wrote to me.\n\nYour letter gratified me much; but there were two things in it that I did not like very much. One was that Samuel intends to take Percy out to Minnesota with him. I had been hoping that he would leave him at Elyria;  while himself went on to Minnesota alone.\n\n My greater grievance is that you yourself think you will not come out with him. It will be a great disappointment to us. You know we never really had a home of our own before; and we feel quite important about it.\n\nI do not believe I ever wanted, when a boy, to go home & see my Mother; to come and see me.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101985,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101985","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/1b96438f871638f9560cb5afa1933761.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/1b96438f871638f9560cb5afa1933761.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/1b96438f871638f9560cb5afa1933761.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1b96438f871638f9560cb5afa1933761.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:42:11+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"1b96438f871638f9560cb5afa1933761.jpg","authentication":"d994cce9f6ca2c2becdb841191374da0","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_164_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1562431,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2243,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.06449823318637400160202588494939845986664295196533203125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234706"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234706"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234706"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1b96438f871638f9560cb5afa1933761.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994755,"FileSize":1562431,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2243\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2243,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:03:26","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:47:06","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:47:06","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3153,"ExifImageLength":5060,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"You speak of your being seventy years old as if it were a reason why you should not travel to see your children.

I think he has not been well since his fever last Fall. He got cold and was taken with Ague Chills, had them alternate days the first week, and then it was another week before he got out of doors. He is pretty well now has been out some all the past week, and increased in health & strength.\n\n We were very sorry to hear of your hard journey from Bangor to Milo. Think you ought to have had some easier method of travel, than the Old Stage Mud Wagon.

April, July & Oct., shall be payable at Lorain Bank to your order, for your sole use & behoof, as long as you live. This would clothe you as you like, and leave a slight balance for J.B. as dear Joseph used to have it.  How would that suit you?  Do come, Mother!\nAnd don't wait a year first either. You can go back there every year if you like. \nWe intend to visit there frequently after we get arranged - most every year perhaps.\n\nNettie thinks I have abused Charlie in my reference to him. He is said to be a remarkably fine looking Child, but I think he exhibits more dignity than agility by far ~ couldn't well be otherwise with his substantial form.\n I wish you could see my Garden now. The Corn is 8 or 10 feet high. The Beet Carrots etc. absolutely quarrelling for room. Tomatoes are big as a small milkpan almost, but not yet beginning to ripen.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102002,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102002","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/26d769d7c87fb921f3219a8c8266af2e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/26d769d7c87fb921f3219a8c8266af2e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/26d769d7c87fb921f3219a8c8266af2e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/26d769d7c87fb921f3219a8c8266af2e.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T13:42:35+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:12+00:00","filename":"26d769d7c87fb921f3219a8c8266af2e.jpg","authentication":"13d23ff815b20e080af30aa7833aec88","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_165_001_004_o2.jpg","size":1864418,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2666,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.06475292434219699633235478586357203312218189239501953125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234902"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234902"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["234902"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"26d769d7c87fb921f3219a8c8266af2e.jpg","FileDateTime":1587994756,"FileSize":1864418,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2666\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2666,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 12:04:10","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:49:02","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:49:02","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":64,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2939,"ExifImageLength":3968,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1275,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1275","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"We have begun upon our Parlor.

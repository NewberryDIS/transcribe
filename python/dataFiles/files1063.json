Joel Lewis, 2 miles from Nashville, the jaw bones of a man, which easily covered the whole chin & jaw of Col. Lewis, a man of large size. Some year afterwards, Mr Cassady dug up a skeleton from under a small mound near the large one at Bledsoe's Lick, in Sumner county, which measured little short of seven feet in length. Human bones have been dug up at the plantation where Judge Overton now lives, in Davidson county, four miles southwestwardly from Nashville, in making a cellar. These bones were of extraordinary  size. The under jaw bone of one skeleton was very easily slipped over the jaw of Mr Childress, a stout man, full fleshed, very robust & considerably over the common size. These bones were dug up within the traces of ancient walls, in the form of a square of two or three hundred yards in length, situated near an excellent, never failing spring of pure & well tasted water.

Next were the arms & thigh bones, lying beside each other, with their upper ends near the head rock, and the skull directly on the upper end of these bones; hence it is supposed the body was not prostrate. With this personage were found some other singularities; three vessels and two conch shells, when one of each set is customary in these small graves.

Some match-coats, he says, were made of hair, or racoon, beaver or squirrel skins; others again were made of the green part of the skin of the mallard's head, or other fowls, which they stitch or sow perfectly well together; their thread being the sinews of a deer divided very small, or silk grass.

It was found in a mound at Marietta, half a mile east of these remarkable fortifications on the Muskingum. The mound is situated in a woody plain, with a gentle declivity towards the river, and a small stream washes its base. During the autumnal rains, or the melting of the snow in the spring, it runs with the velocity of a current. Thus it has gradually washed away the earth, and laid open the mound for a considerable space, and in this situation the cup was discovered. It was then in a bruised, or shapeless mass, and foul from adhering clay; but being taken to a silversmith, was put into the shape it now presents, which was probably the shape it origi-","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":72124,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/72124","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/8d1c7ae52d189ecb6dca19176d675b8e.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/8d1c7ae52d189ecb6dca19176d675b8e.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/8d1c7ae52d189ecb6dca19176d675b8e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8d1c7ae52d189ecb6dca19176d675b8e.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:09:35+00:00","modified":"2020-06-02T20:41:14+00:00","filename":"8d1c7ae52d189ecb6dca19176d675b8e.jpg","authentication":"96196dc45d0892f7f13d27a0bedc14b3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":84,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL11_FL004_00027_o2.jpg","size":663857,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2474,"compression_ratio":0.049691382975538},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["115147+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["115147+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["115147+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8d1c7ae52d189ecb6dca19176d675b8e.jpg","FileDateTime":1522681727,"FileSize":663857,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2474\"","Height":2474,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2474,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:25:19","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4474},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:21 11:51:47","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:21 11:51:47","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":79,"SubSecTimeDigitized":79,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2474,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1063,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1063","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"225\noriginally had.

The remains are four or five feet in depth even now in many places. 349. \nFrom p: 354 forward - \"On the outside of the","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":72131,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/72131","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/850019924cc7694ca18705feed79d72f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/850019924cc7694ca18705feed79d72f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/850019924cc7694ca18705feed79d72f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/850019924cc7694ca18705feed79d72f.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:09:41+00:00","modified":"2020-06-03T07:34:30+00:00","filename":"850019924cc7694ca18705feed79d72f.jpg","authentication":"00ec4ad5edc5cb8c116e8ae7ca72cc47","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":91,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL11_FL004_00034_o2.jpg","size":636398,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2510,"compression_ratio":0.046952781466726},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["115428+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["115428+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["115428+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"850019924cc7694ca18705feed79d72f.jpg","FileDateTime":1522681727,"FileSize":636398,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2510\"","Height":2510,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2510,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:25:25","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4458},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:21 11:54:28","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:21 11:54:28","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":76,"SubSecTimeDigitized":76,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2510,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1063,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1063","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"232\nof the parapet, near the oblong square, [of the principal remains at Marietta], is a considerable number of fragments of ancient potter's ware, which are ornamented with lines, some of them quite curious and ingenious, on the outside.

their dealings with the Indians, engage to give fair compensation for whatever the Indians yield to them, either collectively or individually.\n\nThe first treaty of emigration in 1807, on the principle of fair payment, guarantees acre for acre for lands.\n\n    Guided by this principle of fair compensation, in the thirteenth Cherokee Treaty, being their first of emigration, (see Synopsis page 25), the United States expressly proclaim that they exchange \"acre for are\" of their own lands in the west, for those of the Indians in the east; -- and when, in the fifteenth Treaty, being the third of emigration, (see Synopsis, page 40), a change of location in the west is agreed on by the Cherokees, in order to make up to them for the smaller value of the substituted land, the United States, to the acre for acre,\" add the sum of fifty thousand dollars.\n\nProof that payment for lands in money was to be expected, where there could be no equivalent in land.\n\n    Thus it appears

The weather moderating, we started at about 9 am and in a short time passed a high + perpendicular bluff of rock, at which there was no landing as it about forty feet high. This rock is called lort des efort? (gate of the dead) in consequence of a war party of the Iroquois returning from a successful enterprize against the Winebagoes, being lost at this point.

A few miles back, we passed the mouth of seminirtion? river which runs a long distance into the interior and heads near Lake Superior; it is navigable for bottenaux? and canoes. Near us is Patterson? point, so called from a fur trader travelling in his canoe in former years from prairie du chain? to Mackinac. On his arrival at this place he was compelled to stop, in consequence of being wind bound. After waiting some time, he enquired of his oldest voyageur, if he could weather the point, and was answered that if he attempted it he would get his neck broken: like most traders, he was impatient of opposition and immediately ordered his canoe which was manned by eight men, to be loaded, and embarked with his crew and dog. In attempting to double the point, his canoe stuck and was dashed to pieces, and himself and all perished except the dog, who swam to shore. When Paterson was drowning, he called to the old man to save him, who only replied \"did I not tell you that you would get your neck broke if you attempted it.\" The dog remained on the beach till the dead body of his master was washed to the shore, and remained by it till some other traders who were passing discovered it and then would not be taken away but by absolute force, when the body was buried. I took a walk some distance from our camp and observed the tracks of the wolf in the sand, and two Indian graves on a sandy hillock; they were covered in the usual manner and had the grave cut on as the totem of the family or band. When the snow is deep in the winter season, in this part of the country, the Indians frequently hunt the deer with snow-shoes + the tomahawk. When they start the animal, they halloo + whoop, which induces the deer to retreat and in a short time to fatigue itself they then pursue him and when considerably exhausted + irritated, the animal will turn around and attack them. Their usual habit is, to jump behind a tree and either strike it in the head with the tomahawk or to fix a knife on a pole and spear it in the breast as it approaches. This moment about two Ottawa canoes with about unclear Indians, have come into our camp for the night. They have two young wood-chucks, or ground-hogs and a young porcupine in the bottom of the canoe among the children. They have an ancient stone axe, of the kind used before they knew the use of iron. They were fine looking Indians and appear to have every thing unclear with them even to a saw. On approaching the shore they threw their dogs over board as is usual.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103864,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103864","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8f86f8316f9cf258f133c10e871bbfe1.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8f86f8316f9cf258f133c10e871bbfe1.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8f86f8316f9cf258f133c10e871bbfe1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8f86f8316f9cf258f133c10e871bbfe1.jpg"},"added":"2020-09-22T19:00:49+00:00","modified":"2020-11-01T19:41:13+00:00","filename":"8f86f8316f9cf258f133c10e871bbfe1.jpg","authentication":"cd2cb18615a01e6aeca0ee1f256060dc","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3226_00009_o2.jpg","size":1302464,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1844,"resolution_y":2868,"compression_ratio":0.0820926754543870040858877246137126348912715911865234375}},"item":{"id":1290,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1290","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"money. It was now near midnight, and although the morning had been one of dispondency, we had made about thirty five miles and continued our course on the lake which was as calm as a mirror and as beautiful a moonlight night as I ever beheld. the Indians who came to us were fine and interesting looking men, had emscidenable? silver on them and were well dressed. Here our host pointed out to me a sandy beach on which he was some years since chased by a large bear + only escaped by a rapid flight. June 24th. \nAbout three o'clock this morning while coasting the lake, we heard the whooping of Indians and shortly after discovered a lodge on the shore. We landed and obtained some more Sturgeon for which we gave them beans?. The lodge was about eight feet in diameter and contained two families, in all seven individuals. They looked very destitute and comfortless + I remarked that it was not surprising that the Indians do not care to die. This lodge had a natural wharf as? dock that ran into the lake for about forty feet, along side of which we laid our bark?, and landed thereon. We continued our course and being rather drousy, I was nearly asleep. Our host was quiet? so when some little stir among our crew excited my attentions and a observation I saw one of them load the gun and discharge it in the air when all hand gave a cheer and then repeated the same? twice more, making in all three? rowing? just as the was passing over the woods. This was done in honor of their commander, the? trader who was this morning twenty two years of age. \nWe landed to take breakfast at about 8 am and discovered some pigeons, but only got one, had some of the sturgeon which tasted well.

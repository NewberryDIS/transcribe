Text - Col. 2:10. \"And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power\". Theme - Those who receive Christ - will have their highest wants supplied. Consider man's wants. Consider the fact that those who receive Christ will have every want completely supplied. Man's wants. 1. He wants saving knowledge. Man has knowledge by which he can make the rivers his road, and the ocean his highway. He can measure the distance to the sun and the starts, and make the lightenings of heaven do his bidding. He can weigh the hills in scales and the mountains in a balance. He possesses powers and faculties which fit him to be a companion of angels, and yet he needs that knowledge which will save the soul. All else is vain. 2. Man needs justifying righteousness. No one can obtain this by his own merits. 3. He needs the aids of the Holy Spirit. 4. He needs an Almighty Friend, to protect him against the evils which encompass him. 5. Man wants a home in Heaven. He know how dear is an earthly home and how we pity the poor wanderer who has no home. No home in all this wide, unfriendly world! Well may we love our earthly home; but we need a home beyond the skies, when the turmoil of life shall be past. Consider the fact, that those who receive Christ, will have every want completely supplied. Do we need saving knowledge? Christ can impart it. He is the medium of communication between God and fallen man. The word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Do we need justifying righteousness? Christ is the end of the law to everyone that believeth. Do we need the aids of the Holy Spirit? Christ has promised his followers that he will send them the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost. Do we need an Almighty friend? Christ is such. He has all power in Heaven and on earth; and he has said he will never leave nor forsake those who trust in him. Do we need a home in heaven? Christ will provide us this. He says, \"In my Father's house are many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you\".

We have a stated meeting of this kind every month, at which familiar remarks are made upon whatever had occurred of interest pertaining to Freedom, during the month just expired.  I always enjoy them much.  The visit of Kossuth, and the bearing it is likely to have upon the cause of Liberty, are the grand themes for discussion at present.

Most assuredly, you will be remembered then. Brother George cannot be with us, but he wishes to arrange his studies so as to leave, and be at home when you come.

I should like to view the prospect from your window; indeed I should enjoy viewing anything that seems spring-like.  We are almost tired of waiting for the snow to be gone.  Winter still holds undisputed sway, and the warm winds linger in the sunny south.  Last Monday, father stood upon a snow bank nearly six feet high and measured a giant icicle pendant from the eaves of the house.  It was thirty one inches long, and five and one half inches round at the largest end. Another, eighteen inches long, lay on the bank.  This was the afternoon, too, after it had been thawing some all day.  The next day we had a severe snow storm.\nI must tell you about some apples Jenny saved for you.  They were beautiful great ones and were waiting down cellar for you to come.  In excellent health they were all winter long, blushing every time I looked upon them. And seeming in a fever of expectation till first of March passed.  Then, not being so stouthearted as I, they could endure no longer, but began visibly to decline and you may guess their fate - poor things!","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98475,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/98475","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b17367289cccb3df47ae8f4beeeb4a56.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b17367289cccb3df47ae8f4beeeb4a56.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b17367289cccb3df47ae8f4beeeb4a56.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b17367289cccb3df47ae8f4beeeb4a56.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T18:47:57+00:00","modified":"2020-06-12T16:48:47+00:00","filename":"b17367289cccb3df47ae8f4beeeb4a56.jpg","authentication":"a8a2ee414bf2531a192469e49f1ca0a3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_105_011_002_o2.jpg","size":1370214,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2758,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046001329465796},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230307"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230307"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230307"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b17367289cccb3df47ae8f4beeeb4a56.jpg","FileDateTime":1587322012,"FileSize":1370214,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2758\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2758,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:51:05","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:12 23:03:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:12 23:03:07","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":47,"SubSecTimeOriginal":25,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2907,"ExifImageLength":3794,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1240,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1240","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I was exceedingly interested in what you relate of your experience regarding Methodism, and the Methodists.

I had not heard about the accident before.\n    I have been out, this afternoon, to spend a few hours with the wife of our physician. You would have been interested and perhaps pleased to have heard a part of the conversation at least, - the questions and replies regarding the prospective of our lives - that which is as yet the unknown future.\n     The parsonage seems to be a sort of depository or receptacle of all the joys and sorrows of the parish. To the pastor's study they come and open a whole budget of greivances to find redress; or unfold their takes of whatever distresses or pleases them, expecting advice or sympathy as the case may demand, and seeming, in their turn, to deem all that pertains to the welfare of their pastor and his family, as their common property. This manifestation of  interest in our well being it is pleasant to perceive, though sometimes we feel as if it would be quite as comfortable not to be quite so public characters. The good matrons here, some of the gray-headed ones too, seem to feel about as much interest in my affairs and prospects as if I were their child;  and I feel somewhat of the same confidence in them that I do in my own dear parents. I should be so glad if you knew some of these dear, good friends, for I should love to write often about them if you did. They are not the rich and the great, but \"the quaint and quiet ones,\" plain and honest hearted. So you may imagine many a question is bestowed, for which I am grateful, and, of which we may perhaps sometime reap the benefit.

After recieving yours of March 14, I relinquished entirely the idea of seeing you before July or August; and as mother and Jenny seemed not to require my assistance at home, and I did not like the idea of being useless, or unemployed, and had an application to take a small school near home, I decided to do so, and commenced operations last Monday.\n    Had I received yours of Apr. 4, in which you state that you may come East very soon, I should not of course have engaged the school; but it is a small one, and I can leave it with very little trouble. It closes the last week in June at any rate - only eight weeks long. Now I hope this will\n\n[left-hand side and top]  I hope you will excuse this careless letter, for I have written hurriedly. You think I must agree that you write often. Your letters are worth a great deal to me and never come too often. Do not fear writing too many if you have time to spend so. Most truly yours, Antoinette.  I shall look for you a little this week and shall be most happy if you come.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98483,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/98483","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d170f482cca72cdff07d461f84710379.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d170f482cca72cdff07d461f84710379.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d170f482cca72cdff07d461f84710379.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d170f482cca72cdff07d461f84710379.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T18:48:08+00:00","modified":"2020-07-18T02:04:05+00:00","filename":"d170f482cca72cdff07d461f84710379.jpg","authentication":"05f1486e33a21748dd8c1d9f8958c939","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_105_013_002_o2.jpg","size":1409573,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2714,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048089911023772},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230352"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230352"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230352"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d170f482cca72cdff07d461f84710379.jpg","FileDateTime":1587322013,"FileSize":1409573,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2714\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2714,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:51:22","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:12 23:03:52","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:12 23:03:52","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":47,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2871,"ExifImageLength":3808,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1240,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1240","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"not trouble you.

The children are unusually forward for those so young - the school room is, I think on the whole, the most comfortable and convenient one in town.

I miss your dearest all the time, but I think, with you, it is better not to fret.

Mr. Rider seemed to enjoy playing with him and laughing at him very much. He played so long after undressing that he felt cold after it I expect for he cried very hard a little while. He took four or five steps all alone today. Mother said he would soon go alone, and that she had no expectations of seeing, physically, in little Mayo so strong and healthy a child.

We stopped at noon at a private house where they sometimes put up people and had a most Excellent dinner - all clean and neat etc. Some tired at night. Samuel & I picked some checkerberry leaves to bring home to Mallie. A letter from you came also a letter from Dunbarton the first received since we were there. Father and mother had been to a ministers Convention at Concord and were detained in that way from writing, the letter, beside, was not put in the box so I did not get it as soon as otherwise. They were all well as usual, George at Pembroke, father to get a school for him next winter. I do wish he could do something besides keep school. They seem anxious to see me and yet willing I should do as is the best. I hardly know whether it is best for me to wait for Anne. I can not then be home before last week in July. I know it would be ever so much pleasanter to go with her, but will seem a long waiting to father & mother\n\nTuesday 20. Reading \"Lamplighter\". Raining part of the day. Two books at Fowler & bomb? come from you today. What made you think to send them? I am glad you did however.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98504,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/98504","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/8557608e3bd78ed0b4772164c080d98f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/8557608e3bd78ed0b4772164c080d98f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/8557608e3bd78ed0b4772164c080d98f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8557608e3bd78ed0b4772164c080d98f.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T18:48:35+00:00","modified":"2020-07-18T20:18:10+00:00","filename":"8557608e3bd78ed0b4772164c080d98f.jpg","authentication":"77f451360dc30b5e72d14941656cf6de","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_106_003_001_o2.jpg","size":1692687,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2805,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05587532184591},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230637"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230637"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230637"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8557608e3bd78ed0b4772164c080d98f.jpg","FileDateTime":1587322014,"FileSize":1692687,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2805\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2805,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"22mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:52:12","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:12 23:06:37","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:12 23:06:37","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":47,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3677,"ExifImageLength":4719,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1240,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1240","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Dunbarton Nett.\nSept. 1 - 5 - 1854. \n-  16. 1854                                                                                                  Dunbarton, Sept. 1, 1854.\nMy dearest Isaac,-\n\n                         Last Friday my usual letter came not, but last night {Thursday} came one mailed Aug 22 at Mount Hawkins also one mailed the 26 inst. at St. Louis and the pictures. I opened the case and dear Isaac looked at me from underneath a broad oershadowing hat brim, just like himself, only a little browner methought  perhaps really so, perhaps only seeming, from the contrast with the light coat and hat. Then the additional hairs on the upper lip made it look at first a little older and fiercer perhaps, - but - I like it more & more - have about concluded it is a grand good picture. I had an idea you would shave, or rather not shave to suit yourself this summer, while away from us all. Now I should not admire that mustache or anybody else, and I like your face just as well without it, but am amazing glad you concluded to make an exhibition of the present condition of your countenance now I know how you are looking now. I have looked at that face so long tonight that it seems to stand out from the plate a living form, and so strange that it speaks not nor moves. O how it makes me long to see your very self. I am very glad you sent. It seems to me I can notice better you are really there living & acting, and I can see you again sometime.

Mother is writing a little to you She takes a deal of comfort with little Mayo.  We had rain last Friday and Saturday, gentle and quite and fresh.  Saturday night it rained very powerfully indeed.  seemed to be pailsfull rather than drops.  The grass looks quite green since the potatoes probably so much refreshed by plentiful drinking, that they will grow a little more.

Now the little boy is playing with kitty running all about the floor, and trying to talk, so I take the time to write while he does not need me. I have been at meeting all day - mother went last sabbath. We had not a very full house for it rained very steadily all day long - moistening the glad earth and replenishing the exhausted springs. Last Tuesday came your long letters telling me about the sad accident. The next morning with my bonnet on ready for a ride to Concord, I scribbled a note to you to take with me and mail at C. Yesterday came yours of Nov. 7 mailed at St. Louis, and a good one from sister Mallie. They are enjoying housekeeping much- both her sisters probably to be there this winter. She said my Isaac wrote her \"some beautiful lines in a letter to Eliab\". She says, \"how I do like Isaac.\" Mallie is a dear, kind sister and excellent wife, I think. - and that little Percie is getting fat and healthy again. Is'nt it good? And all that exposure and labor & loss of sleep has not made you sick! I do think it is wonderful. How can I help saying \"My cup runneth over\" when I think of that accident and of your safety. It makes me feel as though you surely would be kept; and we shall meet again to be thankful and happy together. Is Mitchell getting well? How good that he too was so little injured\n\n[left-hand side] I do not think I had better get a cloak now this winter. You know that large warm cape like my brown Thibet dress. That will answer every purpose. Almost every one wears furs - round neck and wrists tipped, and I do not know what else they style thus  -- but I have a muff and that is enough I think. I like you to have you tell me about dress, for I like your taste.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98509,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/98509","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/af4fa2813798e32b6b54cdf094052533.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/af4fa2813798e32b6b54cdf094052533.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/af4fa2813798e32b6b54cdf094052533.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/af4fa2813798e32b6b54cdf094052533.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T18:48:42+00:00","modified":"2020-07-18T21:18:44+00:00","filename":"af4fa2813798e32b6b54cdf094052533.jpg","authentication":"f9ffb810847f7cae7b52b68752bcadba","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_106_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1674031,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2805,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.055259490328118},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230715"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230715"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230715"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"af4fa2813798e32b6b54cdf094052533.jpg","FileDateTime":1587322014,"FileSize":1674031,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2805\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2805,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"22mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:52:25","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:12 23:07:15","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:12 23:07:15","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":47,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3670,"ExifImageLength":4710,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1240,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1240","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I am glad too it happened by no carelessness of any of your men.

Mr. Fletcher has resided in Europe some years - is a fine speaker.\n\n  I got a velvet bonnet and paid therefore $8.00. That is enough is'nt it for one bonnet. My conscience almost smites me. It makes $13.00 dollars kist for bonnets this year - beside my travelling one. I do not think I have been very saving this season, but I have not intended to be wasteful! I enjoyed the ride to Concord much. Grand old Kearsarge seemed only four or five miles away, at most - hoary with snow, and the sun shining full upon it. I never saw it to so fine advantage before, just so with the whole range of hills about us. I would have gone twice the distance to behold such a scene. Since the rain the grass has grown green as in spring almost. George came home Thursday from Pembroke. I came from Concord the same day with the mail carrier in an old rickety wagon, a horse who very evidently had ribs and the most eccentric driver you ever saw - bright though & strictly honest & upright. He weilded the limb of a tree for a whip!  I got home safely by three in the P.M. & little Mayo was glad enough","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98511,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/98511","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d648efdeaf3152bcce86f5e7164ac904.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d648efdeaf3152bcce86f5e7164ac904.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d648efdeaf3152bcce86f5e7164ac904.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d648efdeaf3152bcce86f5e7164ac904.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T18:48:44+00:00","modified":"2020-07-18T21:55:26+00:00","filename":"d648efdeaf3152bcce86f5e7164ac904.jpg","authentication":"e610a9c020b592571dd6fbe579520d01","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_106_004_004_o2.jpg","size":1814754,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2765,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.060771348201728},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230725"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230725"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230725"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d648efdeaf3152bcce86f5e7164ac904.jpg","FileDateTime":1587322014,"FileSize":1814754,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2765\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2765,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"22mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:52:30","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:12 23:07:25","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:12 23:07:25","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":47,"SubSecTimeOriginal":96,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3641,"ExifImageLength":4740,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1240,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1240","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"to see me.

Mr. Amos Hadley - once teacher here you remember, waited upon us to the Evening lecture. I spent the night at Esq. Kimball's, an old friend of mother's, since Thursday as I did Wednesday with Mrs. Smart. I imagine you have heard me speak of her. I used to board with her when I attended school in Concord. \n\n    Last Friday, I baked some in A.M. and after we dined, & Mayo had his nap George took him and me and we called at Capt. Stinson's at a Mr. Wilson's and at Harris Rider's. Mayo was good at the two first places, but at Mr. Rider's for some reason he acted like a little fury--cried and stamped & kicked and shook his head and exhibited clearly that he had a will of his own - spoilt our call entirely - shall have to go again I reckon and leave him at home.\n   Harris' little boy has been very sick with scarlet fever. He and his mother went to Salem to visit, and he was taken sick there. She only came about a week since. The little boy looks very pale yet. Is'nt Mr. Season on the line often these days & Almost every letter speaks of your meeting him somewhere.  You say  Big Muddy Bridge is done - is Little Muddy too? I do not care a bit how soon it is all done. But I shall not look for you till Jan. lest I be disappointed.\n  I wonder what Mistress Keyes thinks of going to the station to live? I expect I ought to send my love to her. Won't you give some to her next time you call. You know she really was very kind indeed to me when I was sick in June. How much she did for little Mayo - and I cannot help remembering it. I don't think the woman is as good as she might be, and who is? \"Give every one his due and who would 'scape whipping\"?

E. thinks to be gone two nights I believe, and we shall persuade him to stay longer if we can. Samuel will go up to come home with Lucy. I am writing very hurriedly because Lizzie wants to be studying & I ought to be caring for Mayo as soon as I can. Lizzie goes to singing school two afternoons in the week. She wants very much to go to Milo with us, but must stay with Ellen & Samuel I suppose and there would not be room either with the three babies. Lucy & I could not possibly carry our boys in our laps all the way without some back-breaking. I expected to go in stage all the while, but it would have been hard.

Had a nice view & do not any of us feel much tired, not even Lucy. All the trouble was Lucy & I wanted Samuel & Isaac. It seems such a half way sort of business to have the biggest half of yourself gone, when one has something to enjoy. Mayo seems quite at home already. I just went out for him & found him coaxing Kitty out of doors. He said ' tum Kitty, tum out doors, out doors, oh yeth\" Kitty  could'nt resist it. The other day he came and kissed me ever so many times and then said \"there, dat all, I beeve (believe) dat all.\" and ran away. He talks about \"dear father\" every  day. There are some misquitoes here.  I am afraid the children will get scarred faces.  \n\n   Yesterday Lucy went to meeting in A.M. and Mr. Field preached again. I seem fated not to hear him. I went in P.M. & heard Prof. Shepard - not quite so interesting as usual. Text \"God loveth a cheerful giver.\" It is a lovely day to day - we could'nt have had a better - fair and comfortable. All ever well here Mother looks finely- she has just finished reading","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98522,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/98522","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/fc02a7b2bbd0d9256f02e7180ceebe63.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/fc02a7b2bbd0d9256f02e7180ceebe63.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/fc02a7b2bbd0d9256f02e7180ceebe63.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fc02a7b2bbd0d9256f02e7180ceebe63.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T18:49:00+00:00","modified":"2020-07-19T03:01:38+00:00","filename":"fc02a7b2bbd0d9256f02e7180ceebe63.jpg","authentication":"9b60481beb68b0e7eaae707ab3fbdcff","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_106_007_004_o2.jpg","size":1502492,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2824,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049263324939671},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230855"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230855"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["230855"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"fc02a7b2bbd0d9256f02e7180ceebe63.jpg","FileDateTime":1587322014,"FileSize":1502492,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2824\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2824,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:53:01","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:12 23:08:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:12 23:08:55","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":47,"SubSecTimeOriginal":49,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3411,"ExifImageLength":4348,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1240,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1240","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"your last letter.

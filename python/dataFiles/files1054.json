So also with regard to persons going off on any other business. Some had a peculiar kind of very thin stones, of a whitish colour, these they took to a stream of water, prayed to the beings named above, and then threw the stones on the water. If they swam off some distance, and then returned to the shore before sinking, all would be well. But if they sunk before they reached the shore, the person, or persons on whose behalf they were used would die, & not return. The stones also, when the person or persons were to die, turned, it is said, to a bloody colour.

In this they put two grains, resembling grains of powder.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70715,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70715","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/66525170182c113500e3919726f3847b.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/66525170182c113500e3919726f3847b.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/66525170182c113500e3919726f3847b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/66525170182c113500e3919726f3847b.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:43:53+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:14+00:00","filename":"66525170182c113500e3919726f3847b.jpg","authentication":"809d23f0ce22c63193dbc4beb2d99465","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL013_00018_o2.jpg","size":577439,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2937,"compression_ratio":0.036408971109346},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["020537+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["020537+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["020537+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"66525170182c113500e3919726f3847b.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424621,"FileSize":577439,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2937\"","Height":2937,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2937,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:11:50","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4114},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 02:05:37","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 02:05:37","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":15,"SubSecTimeDigitized":15,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2937,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1054,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1054","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"540\n\nWhen warriors had killed any person, or touched a dead body, or a bone of a dead person, they were unclean four days; they took a certain drink to puke them washed or bathed the whole body; and must not sleep with their wives for seven nights, and in case a warrior was wounded, he could not sleep with his wife for twenty nights.\nThe rules with regard to touching a grave, were the same as touching a dead body.

In some of their ancient prayers, they speak of the sun as a male, & consider, of course, the moon as a female. In others, however, they represent the sun as the female & the moon as the male: for this reason they say, because the moon travels, is wakeful, etc in the night. Another reason probably operated to bad bade them to reject the ancient opinion viz. The unwearied? attention of the sun to the necessities of the earth, in bringing forward all its productions, etc. and also the supposed creative power of the sun in forming all things, except the earth and the man & woman. Thus the sun is called the creator in all their ancient prayers, that is, when they speak of this creator they mean the sun. In one of their most ancient prayers to be repeated early in the morning, when going to the water, they pray to the creator for a long & happy life here as this will be their only place of happiness, and some add a request to this creator to take their spirit, and carry it with him (her) till he (she) arrives at the meridian (till noon) and then give it back to them. This prayer, excepting the last clause, is also repeated at night. They also use this expression in their prayers. A ke yu ku go.

For the same reason also hunters waved their mockasins & legings over the fire. \n\n  Some Cherokees give the following account of their sacred fire. After their arrival on this continent, from beyond the sea, they sent back for some of their sacred fire, which existed there, an active intelligent agent in the form of a man. Accordingly a little of this fire was taken from that man of fire & conveyed over the water by a spider which wrapped it in her web.  When they got this fire, they kept it always in their council house, that is, in a hole or cave dug under the council house. (Others say this fire originally came down from heaven.) Their council house was eventually taken by their enemies, & destroyed, but they suppose the fire is still in the hole under ground where they left it. \n  Having lost this sacred fire, they endeavored to remedy the evil by making new fire. Taking two pieces of [Wawhod?] Basswood, they put a weed called gold rod, between them & then rubbed them swiftly against each other till the weed, & wood took fire. Among the Creeks, & perhaps among ancient? Cherokees, all the fire was extinguished every year, about the commencement of autumn & new fire made. Among the Cherokees new fire was made at the commencement, & used during every war, or hunting expedition. Also when a person died, all the old wood and fire were taken out of the house, & new fire made as above. Their prayers are often addressed to the fire.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70735,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70735","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/25e799aa0aed59abb17db5907c9b1270.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/25e799aa0aed59abb17db5907c9b1270.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/25e799aa0aed59abb17db5907c9b1270.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/25e799aa0aed59abb17db5907c9b1270.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:44:12+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:15+00:00","filename":"25e799aa0aed59abb17db5907c9b1270.jpg","authentication":"4c8ebb6842ea26d311fc343bcc31e0b4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL014_00006_o2.jpg","size":637876,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2966,"compression_ratio":0.039826427911391},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["021954+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["021954+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["021954+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"25e799aa0aed59abb17db5907c9b1270.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424622,"FileSize":637876,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2966\"","Height":2966,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2966,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:12:00","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5020},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 02:19:54","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 02:19:54","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":76,"SubSecTimeOriginal":76,"SubSecTimeDigitized":76,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2966,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1054,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1054","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"\"Copied\" written vertically across center of page\n\n                                                                                                                              566                                                                                          7\n\nbe permitted to cross, but on arriving at the other side they would be put in a house of fire and transfixed with large iron spikes, & thus tortured forever. \n\n   Just before sun set, the priest offered sacrifice of meat, sprinkling on the fire Old Tobacco.

A certain man and his wife had two sons - twins. The raising of  corn was then unknown, yet the woman used to go into a certain house daily, and fetch corn & cook for her family. At length the boys watching her, discovered that she went into the house and prayed, and the corn fell from her. They then determined to kill her, & gave her notice of their intentions. She then told them that if they did kill her, they must drag her body about on the groung ground?, corn would spring up which they must tend, & thus raise corn for themselves. They accordingly did so, and for this first time corn grew from [the?] earth. But the mother, after being thus? dragged about came to life and went? above. The boys also soon became tired of life and went up. Since then this woman has been honored as a goddess.

Let them be vain in this case, and let him get well. What thou hast done (or made) and the remedy which I have administered, agree, Therefor let the man speedily recover. The same prayer was then addressed to the white man in the West, to the white man in the south, & to the white man in the east. Thus, the above prayer was repeated five times. White man in the above prayer, is probably only another name for priest, as the official dress of the Indian priests, was white. The term white evidently relates to the dress only, & not to the complexion of the skin.    Br.

 C.N. Jan 23rd 1836.\n\nDear Brother Butler\n\n                                         Your dear favour of the 16th inst came to hand a few days ago & I embrace the first moments of leisure for answer the inquiries of Mr. Payne. \n    I doubt very much whether a \"History of our Cherokee Mission\" has ever been published separately, at least I have never seen or heard of such a work. There is an English work extant entitled \"Historical Sketches of the Missions of the United Brethren, by Rev John Holmes.\" which however my Library does not contain. Mr. R. can get said work either at Bethlehem P. or of the Pastors of our Churches in Philadelphia & New York, & in said work we may find such notices of our Cherokee Mission as may serve his purpose. The manuscript Journal of the Mission is here, & might ennable any one to compile something of a history but this would require a considerable amount of time & labour as it is written in the German language. The history of the last year of the existance of our illusion at Spring place is still so fresh in my memory that I can very readily retake such particulars as may interest Mr. Payne, without recurring to the Journals, & which I wilt embody in this Letter as follows.\n    In the Spring of 1832 I took charge of the Mission at Spring place, as successor to the Revd. Gottlieb Byham, who had laboured, at two different periods for about 17 years at this place, & who was one of those who in 1801 had aided in the establishment of this first Mission among the Cherokees. During this first & only year of my residence at Spring place a general survey of that part of the Cherokee Nation lying within, the so called limits of Georgia took place preparatory to a Land lottery by which, the vast domain the rightful property of the Red Man, was to be parcelled out in stirke out: half 160 Acre lots, to thousand of \"Fortunate drawers\" The internal state of the Mission during this year was quite encouraging; we had as many Indian scholars as we could possibly accommodate  & very many applications for admittance to our school we were reluctantly forced to refuse merely for most of room.

We felt ourselves quite secure in our domicile & entertained little anxiety about the probable issue of the agressions of the State of Georgia, upon this territory, firmly believing that the so called Fortunate drawers would not forthwith seize their prizes. The Laws morever were of such a nature at this time, that the occupant Claims of the Cherokees were respected & all loss upon which any Indian held on improvements, were to remain untouched. Our Spring place possessions were altogether embraced in the claims of Joseph Vann, a Cherokee & more than two thirds of the Lot upon which the mission buildings stood were owned & cultivated by him. The greater therefore was my astonishment, when on the 24th of December several men rode up & announced to fact that our lot had been granted to the \"Fortunate drawer\" who was willing out of peculiar favour to us to rent our premises to us at the moderate sum of 150$ pr annum. My efforts to convince these visitors, of the illegallity of their proceeding, were utterly vain, & in vain did I point out to them the exact position of the lines & landmarks & how our possessions were entirely involved with the claims of Mr. Vann. I refused renting, upon which possession was demanded, & denied. Here negotiations ended for the present. I had however many reasons to apprehend another attack, & in order to satisfy myself of the fact of the issue of the grant - I addressed a line to his Excellency the Governor, in which I represented the claims of Mr. Vann, and solicited if possible a withdrawal of the Grant, if indeed one had been issued for our possessions.

In consequence of my refusal to grant any such liberty - the waggoner was compelled to wait until next day Jan 1st 1833. when at a late hour the company consisting of 18 persons arrived. My protestations against their intrusion availed nothing - & by force & fraud they obtained possion of all our buildings leaving 2 small rooms for my family. I concluded to await an answer from Milledgeville & therefore made no preparations for a removal, indeed I entertained strong hopes that I should finally rid my self of this unpleasant company. On the 4th of January, a suspicions looking personage arrived & spent the greater part of the day in the company of my new housemates & held long consultations with them. This person I was told was a certain Col Bishop of Gainsville & \"moreover the Governors aid - de-camp\" On Sabbath the 6th this same person again made his appearance & now a transfer of the claim of one of my housemates to our positions, took place & was transferred to Bishop.

When I came to examine his papers I found he had but a small part of the file. I selected what I could and have forwarded them to you by my two sons who left here three weeks since for New York. You have probably received them before this.   Soon after receiving your letter I wrote to Mr. Pratt requesting him to assist me in procuring the remaining numbers of the Phoenix. I also mentioned to him with regard to the discussion you spoke of in your letter. I have had no reply from him -  I received three copies of your statement for which I thank you. In a few days they were in circulation, and I have not been fortunate enough to lay my hands on one since.   I was at the time a little sorry my name was mentioned, but I do not know that any harm has","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70791,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70791","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/f93b6a273480af542eaa2ed599b3ab04.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/f93b6a273480af542eaa2ed599b3ab04.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/f93b6a273480af542eaa2ed599b3ab04.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f93b6a273480af542eaa2ed599b3ab04.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:45:06+00:00","modified":"2020-10-09T02:14:10+00:00","filename":"f93b6a273480af542eaa2ed599b3ab04.jpg","authentication":"758a51200f4f0f18061352d205988f71","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL05_FL002_00002_o2 copy.jpg","size":649244,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2271,"compression_ratio":0.052941598577882},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["110652+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["110652+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["110652+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f93b6a273480af542eaa2ed599b3ab04.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424624,"FileSize":649244,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2271\"","Height":2271,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2271,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:12:28","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5164},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 11:06:52","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 11:06:52","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":14,"SubSecTimeDigitized":14,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2271,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1054,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1054","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"grown from it.

These were met by Bishop and twenty five or thirty armed men - lines were formed and at the instant of fireing, Bishop with his hat off presented his gun and gave himself up.

He succeeded in detaining a delegation from the Cherokees, west;' to unite with him at Washington. They accompanied him a part of the way, and then separated on account of the difficulty of travelling, the western route. \n    The last Council appointed a Committee to settle with Judge Martin, the National Treasurer, and receive from him the National property in his hands; as he was about to remove to the west. Just as they were about closing their business, or had actually closed it; and before they had all left Judge Martin's, a number of General Wools' Army made prisoners of Judge Martin, Judge McCoy, Messrs. Lewis Ross, and Elijah Hicks? & they also seized the contents of the iron chest containing smudge accounts, and papers of the Treasurer page torn Hicks contained in the chest was returned. They blotted out the a  smudge taken to General Wool at the Agency. The prisoners? were soon set at liberty; but the accounts and papers were retained. The reason a unclear was that they were needed at New Town where the Commissioners and the treaty Committee word scratched out are transacting  business. It was also said to these men that other books and papers were needed and should be given up.\n    A few weeks since Col. Bishop found on a day of election at Spring Place that his favourites were not likely to be elected, when he and his party served the public aims at the place, and broke up the election. The Sherriff then issued his order for all who were in favor of the laws to assist in arresting Col. B. Two armies were soon collected of nearly equa force, and the daily expectation through the country was that a pitched battle would be fought.

Feby 8\nMr. John Howard Payne\nNew York\nat bottom:\nDear Sir,  It was my intention to comply with your request in sending you a copy of my statement of my husband's arrests and imprisonment. Should I attempt to detail the many things that have prevented my so doing, it would require a whole sheet instead of this little space my husband has left me. The sickness of my infant, who required my constant care, through the summer and autumn, our labours in building and getting our school into operation have been among the first hindrances. My husband and I looked over some publications of the day of his imprisonment and selected items which we thought would prove more help to you than the article we had in view. My husband noted them down in a letter, which I hope you received. But he still thought I was under obligation to give you a copy of what had been requested, saying he would transcribe when business called me aside. We filled one large sheet, - but when done, what a mutilated piece! In order to get it on one sheet, a considerable abridgement  was made, and much entirely left out, particularly that part which related to myself and business at home, in the absence of the Dr. In consequence of these alterations I found there was much want of connection in the parts copied; and while more than half of a mind, not to send it, like school children we upset the ink stand on it. Persuading myself that what had been already sent superseded the need of this, I threw it aside - Lately my husband ascertained that the Rev. Mr. Butrick had not sent what he had prepared for you some months since, and persuaded him to send immediately.

On the said morning, eleven armed men rode up to the gate and dismounted. My husband walked to the door to receive them. Seargeant Brooks inquired if he were Dr. Butler, and was answered in the affirmative. He then inquired by what authority he was living there; to which the Dr. replied he considered himself under the protection of the U.S. Government and that he was also labouring as missionary by the approbation of the Cherokees. The Sergeant then ordered him to get ready and go with him to have the matter settled by higher authorities. He then inquired of the Dr. whether he had a horse, adding with a good deal of authority, \"Be quick.\"  The Dr. invited the company into the hall where they took seats. A hearty meal was soon in preparation for him, also some provision for his comfort on the way. In the meantime two young ladies of our family took their seats in the hall, wishing to know something more of the intention of those who were about to bear our head away. They, pleasantly, but very plainly told the leader their views of the unjust measures that Geo. was then pursuing. He in turn showed forth his greatness by boasting what Geo. could do, and what she was determined to do. &c. adding there were hostilities in the Nation which should be allayed, if it were done by the point of the bayonet;  - as an instance he said a Cherokee had snapped his gun at one of the Geo. guard, and such things should be quelled or Geo. would pour her hundred and fifty thousand soldiers into the Nation. \"That would be a brave act\", was the reply, for that number of Geo. soldiers to be turned out to subdue one poor Cherokee. When the refreshments which had been prepared were upon the table, an invitation was given to the Sergeant and as many of his company as chose to take seats with the Dr. at the table. They politely refused, saying they had breakfasted. All were soon ready for their departure. Our Cherokee children with out own, stood around weeping; and some of the larger Cherokee scholars ventured to petition the commander that the Dr. might soon be returned. After he had gone, the family was assembled, and the prisoner, by prayer, committed to his covenant keeping God.   After they had rode about twelve miles, a compromise was made, that the Dr. might return home, and go to Head Quarters and surrender himself, as suited his convenience. The time specified was the forepart of June, and he returned to the joy, though rather to the surprise of his family.  In two or three weeks after this, the Dr. received a letter from the Gov. of Georgia, informing him that if he did not remove his family in ten days, he must suffer the penalty of the law, and be removed by force. Other Missionaries within the chartered limits of Georgia received letters of the same import. On the 8th of June my husband set out for Head Quarters according to promise. Our little daughter being but four days old. When arrived he introduced himself to the Col. of the Guard, who seemed almost in a rage at his presumption in coming fearlessly and surrendering himself. The Col. told him that he might have considered the letter from the Gov. ordering him to remove, as absolving him from his promise. He poured forth the most vilifying epithets on christians and missionaries. For some time the Dr. thought it very doubtful how the case would turn. Appearances were that they intended arresting him and putting him in irons. it might have been to freighten him and bring him to their terms. The Col. said to him, \"As you are now here you may as well stay.\" The fr. replied \"Very well Sir, it will be just as you say.\" Then the Col. endeavered? to draw from him a promise to remove his family. To this the fr. objected and positively told him he should make no such arrangements. The Col. appeared much perplexed to know what to do, but finally told him he might return home. This was considered only a short respite to get a letter hold?, to \"break him down.\" A term they used respecting those Missionaries who still persisted in holding their stations. In this, we did not misjudge; for on the 7th of July when the Dr. and all the members of the school were attending, a religious meeting at a Cherokee neighbors four armed men arrived on foot, having left their horses a few miles distant. They enquired for the Dr. and on being informed where he was, two set out in quest of him, while the other two remained to watch our proceedings at the house. Those who went after him stopped at our meeting house about quarter of a mile from our dwelling, & when he passed it, they sprang out like wild animals in ambush, made him prisoner. The poor children, nearly twenty in number scattered here and there,  some skulking into one door & some into another. I rested? myself in the hall & began as if nothing strange had happened, relating to my husband the little occurences that had taken place since he had been out, such as the swarming of bees, my skill in manageing so as to get them into a new hive &c. At length the Sergeant told him they had fourteen miles to go that night, and it was time he was making ready. We gave them an invitation to stay until morning, but they refused. I then remarked that supper should be on the table in a few minutes, if they would wait for it; to this they commented. The Dr. asked permission to ride, but they objected. I then went to the Sergeant requesting liberty for the br to take his horse, as he would be at the expense it would oreasien?; be refused, saying he had orders that none of the prisoners should ride. I then clearly saw their motive was to \"Break him down.\" After supper I hastily tied up a few clothes    I likewise brought forward a good supply

North Carolina Dec 25th 1836\n\nDear Sir   Your favour of July 29th was duly recd & should have been answered long since, had it not been for circumstances which prevented the necessary researches into the old M.M.S of our Cherokee Mission. The original Journal of the Mission had been packed up, together with all other Books & papers, preparatory to my removal elsewhere, & my time was so fully occupied, that I could not, until a few weeks ago, direct my attention to your inquiries. I have found here copies of the journals of our early Cherokee Missionaries, and have translated, as well as I could, & transcribed, the particulars of the first interview between our Missionaries & the Chiefs in 1799. I have filled two closely written sheets of letter paper with this matter, & only would beg, your direction whether to send them immediately pr Mail, or, await a private opportunity?    The voluminous journal of Mrs Gambold, is written in the German language & it is full of anecdote, sometimes even of thrilling interest, particularly those in reference to the celebrated James Vann & his cotemporaries. The notices, the visits of a certain Saml Houston at Spring place, & formed a very favourable opinion of him, being at that time of unapunsing? appearance & Manners. His the same one, whose name is now so conspicuous in the affairs of Texas.  It is to be regretted that Mrs Gambold had no biographer, & even astonishing that she was not her own, as she was passionately fond of her pen & wrote about almost every thing, excepting herself. She left a Mass of Manuscript matter, which I fear has been lost to a great extent.    The present state of our Mission, like that of the American board, among the Cherokees, is discouraging to a high degree - from causes, with which you are doubtfully familiar. & which are alike mortifying to every sense of justice &equity, as they are disgraceful to a civilized & enlightened government.  I shall endeavor to file another sheet of matter, by the time, I receive an answer to this, containing your address &c. and as I shall, Providence permitting, return to the West, early in the Spring. I shall be happy to hear from you soon.\n I am, very respectfully   Your humble servt,  H.G.

Feb 8th 1837\n\n Dear Sir    Yours of the 27th ult. is at hand & I hasten to answer the same. Last week we had the unexpected pleasure of seeing Mr J. Ross, at the head of the Delegation from the Cherokee Tribe, both east & west of the Mississp. - at this place on their way to Washington City, & I availed myself of the opportunity of sending the M.M.S. extract from our Journal of the comencement of the Cherokee Mission, by Mr Ross - who said he expected to see you before his return. I think he remarked while here, that he had not been able for most of time, to prepare anything for you. By todays Mail I will write to Mr R. & also to Doct Huntington & request the former to had the package I sent, to Doct H. according to your direction. I have called on Revd. J.R. Smith, this Morning - & shewed him your letter, in order to ascertain from him whether the late Mrs. A.R. Gambold had left any files from which a sketch of her Biography might be gathered; or whether her surviving husband had written anything of the kind after her death - but Mr S? (who at that time & for several years subsequent to her death had charge of the Spr. Place Mission) assured me - that Mrs G always expressed the wish that nothing might be said about her, that\" her name might die with her body\" - & that she had left nothing in the shape or form of a private journal. The Diary to which I have alluded was that of \"The Mission\" & had reference to the every day occurences at Spr.

In the year 1823 McIntosh, the Creek Chief attended the Cherokee Council for the purpose of exerting his influence, in getting them favourable for a removal to the West. He went so far as to offer a bribe to Mr. Ross for his influence in the object. Mr. R. exposed him in the enclosed Speech which he delivered to the Council, & of which I found a copy in Mr. Smiths possession. Although you may have a more complete acct of this affair yet I thought it worth copying as the sentiments expressed therein have since then been put to a cruel test - but still remain unbroken and although your observation that the power of Genl. Jackson has prevailed\" - is but too true, yet how has it prevailed? not indeed by intriguery nor bribery with the Principal Chief, but his power has prevailed & for truth I pity him as a Victor more than strike out: the I do, the innocent & noble Victim. The Poor Victim - the Cherokee Nation has now & ever will receive the sympathy of all good Men while the acts of those in Power, will receive their merited reward of contempt & infamy.\n\n    From Capt McNair I hear that Spring place, of dear, though painful Memory is still a place of lawless violence.

contiguity to the Indian\nCountry would facilitate their access to the Cherokees & Creeks for the purpose of preaching\nthe Gospel to them. Unwitting to relinquish so promising a field of labour, a Company\nof Brethren left Herrnhut in Germany in November 1734, arrived in London towards\nthe end of the same year, & landed in Georgia in the succeeding  Spring of 1735.\nThe same year a second company of Brethren consisting of 26 persons sailed for Ga\nfrom Europe. Their christian deportment on the passage & on their arrival gained them the\nesteem & friendship of the Rev. John & Charles Wesley & Benjm Ingham, who sailed in\nthe same ship. The brethren immediately began to build a house in the town of\nSavannah & afterwards erected a School house upon an Island in Savannah River\ncalled Grene?, 4 Miles above the town, for the instruction of the Children of the Indians\nwho visited them frequently with their chief Torno? T chalchi?.\nIn their letters of the year 1736 it is mentioned that many of the Creeks, Cherokees &\nChikasaws came to the Brethren to hear the Gospel; those in their neighborhood\nsent their children to School where some of the Indian boys & girls learned to read\n& even comenced to write. It appears that the Indians in general were well inclined\ntowards the Brethren & knew very well how to distinguish between them & the rest\nof the white people, who came into their country merely in pursuit of gain or to\nlead a dissolute life. Thus their small Colony began to prosper & appearances were\na favourable aspect as regarded their external condition & the conversion of the heathen.\nRev. Peter Rose & wife, Anthony Seiffart, Biener & others lived in the School house\n& being thus among the Indians they succeeded in their attempts to learn the\nlanguage, in which they also found an able assistant in the Rev. B. Ingham.\nIn the year 1737 the Rev. Peter Boehler of the University of Jena was chosen &\nordained Minister of the Colony in Georgia. But their fair prospects were soon blasted.\nThe Spaniards, being then at war with England, the Brethren were required by the latter\nGovernments to take up arms against the former & join them in expelling the Spaniards\nfrom Georgia. This the brethren refused on the ground that it was contrary to\nthe stipulation made & guaranteed to them by the Government \"that they should \nbe exempt from Military duty\". They were therefore obliged to leave their\nflourishing settlement & plantation, & retire to Pennsylvania. The last Missionary\nJohn Hagen left Georgia in 1740 & returned to Penn where a regular settlement\nwas built in 1741, afterward called  \"Bethlehem\" & which succeeded by others\nsettlements in the following years.\nAfter the suspension of this Southern Mission, the Rev. Christian Rauch arrived in\nNew York, July 16 1740 for the purpose of commencing a Mission among the Mohicans\nat Shekomeko, having been invited to them by the principal Men of the tribe.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70822,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70822","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/f77611b1585f2c63922d1bf9779e27d9.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/f77611b1585f2c63922d1bf9779e27d9.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/f77611b1585f2c63922d1bf9779e27d9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f77611b1585f2c63922d1bf9779e27d9.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:45:39+00:00","modified":"2020-10-13T17:14:18+00:00","filename":"f77611b1585f2c63922d1bf9779e27d9.jpg","authentication":"801d4aac050cedb7f3f3bf64eefdcb68","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL05_FL012_00002_o2

of the principal Motives which induced the United Brethren to establish\nColonies in North Carolina, was to communicate the Gospel to the Southern Indians.\nThe first Colony consisted of 15 unmarried men, who arrived in North Carolina in 1753.\nwho comenced their labours amidst great difficulties in the wilderness, but by the blessing\nof God they succeeded in cleaning the land & building the small town of Bethabara.\nHere the Rev. M. Ettwein had a meeting with several Cherokee Chiefs who declared\nthemselves friendly to a Mission of the Brethren, but shortly afterwards two successive\nWars having broken onto between the white people & the Indians the Brethren were often in\ndanger from the annoyances of the Cherokee, & although closely surrounded by them\nthey were graciously protected by a higher hand, which the Indians themselves owned after\nthe war saying; that the brethrens vigilence, & the regular blowing of the horn, by the watchman\nat night  as well as the ringing of the bells for morning & evening meetings, all of which they\nconsidered a signal of alarm, prevented them from attacking the village, although they had\nfrequently attempted to surprise them in the night. After these manifold troubles the\ndisturbances of the Regulators & the Revolutionary war forbade all new undertakings in\nthe Missionary line.\nIn the year 1783 the Government of North Carolina dispatched Col. Armstrong to the Cherokee\ntowns, for the purpose of entering into negotiations with the Indians, in whose company\nthe Rev. Martin Snider was sent on a Missionary tour to the Cherokee villages on Tennessee\nRiver. M Snider attended a Council of the chiefs, in company with Col. A. in January\n1784, in which the chief Tassel presided & to whom M Snider was introduced\nby Col Armstrong, who made known the Missionary view of the United Brethren.\nAfter a silence of two hours the chief gave the following answer: \"that it was in his\n\"recollection when their father, the King of Great Brittain, a long time ago, had send\n\"2 men as preachers unto them, one of whom had died, & the other did not remain long\n\"with them, on account of a War which broke and to his regret. I beleive, said he, this\n\"man M Snider to be a respectable man, sent by higher men in order to\n\"instruct us of U ne, la-no, hee ( God dwelling above) Although myself, and all\n\"present, are glad for this offer of getting such instruction, still I am, at present unable\n\"to give a distinct answer, on account of the absence of the other chiefs & warriors.\"\nAt their return he promised to convene a great Council to ascertain their opinion the\nresult of which he would comunicate to him, through the Governr & Comissioner.\nOn the 24th of January 1784 M Snider returned to Salem, but while he was preparing\nfor another visit in order to hear the result of his application to the Council a war\nbroke out between the Cherokee & White people, in which all the towns M S.\nhad visited were burned, the Indians dispersed & many of them killed & our\nnegotiations broke off. After the restoration of Peace & other obstacles having\ndisappeared or been removed, the Directors of the United Brethren in North Carolina\nwere informed in the year 1799 that the New York Missionary Society had sent\nthe Rev.

Late in the evening of the same day they\nreached Tellico block house near Tennessee River, 37 Miles from Knoxville.\nThey received a friendly reception, particularly from Capt. Butler, a son of the late\nGen. Butler who fell at the skirmish of St Clair. Although encouraging this laudable\ndesign of the Missionaries, he regretted very much that their visit had not been\nmade 3 weeks sooner, at which time the chiefs and more than 4000 Indians\nhad been assembled at that place.it being the hunting season when most\nof the Men were absent, Capt B. expressed his fears that our purpose would not be\nattained. these brethren provided with the necessary passports nevertheless visited\nthe Indians residing on Tennessee & Hiwassee Rivers, but they found only women\n& children at home, as allmost all the Men were absent on their hunting excursion.\nOn this account they could effect but little, nor could they penetrate farther into the\ninterior.

The great Father who had created\nall men, had likewise given him breath, of which he could also deprive him when\nhe thought proper. He was thankful towards Him, who had hitherto preserved his\nbreath, but we are all of dust, & ere  long must return to dust. The great Father\nthat dwells above. knows all & sees all, he also looked down upon our poor meeting\nheard all the words spoken & rejoiced to see us & hear our words, he regarded\nour smallest actions & had given us many things for our use which we hardly esteemed. Only regard the water\nwithout which we cannot live- a mere trifle! but still He created it for our use.\nAnd what, above all would the red man do, if He had not made the fire, as\nhe is not so well provided with warm clothing as the white people are- every\nwhere the fire his concealed- even from small stones, it could be elicited.\nAnd thus every object around us, pointed out (testified of) the omnipotence of\nGOD. The white Man certainly enjoyed superior advantages- he can provide \nhimself with clothing, to meet the cold. The red man could only build small\ncanoes & cross small streams; the white man could, on the contrary, build\nimmense canoes & safely cross the greatest waters- they too, had the great book\nout of which they could learn every thing. When the great Father had created Men\nHe had a great book which he had first offered to the red man, with the\ncommand to read it. But they could not do this. Hereupon He offered it\nto the white man with the same command. When the latter saw it he\ncould immediately speak to this book- hence the fact, that the white\nman knew so many things, which were not known to the red men.\nThe time appeared, however, to be near when the red men should\nlikewise learn to read it. When the white man first came to this country\nhe had the great book in which is written GOD's word, but he did not\ninstruct the red man therein. He must therefore believe, that the great Spirit\nhad made us willing to come & teach them. He for his part bid us welcome\nhe was satisfied & pleased with it. His people were not at home- upon\ntheir return he would hold a council with them, & perhaps soon return\nan answer. He beleived that every one of his people would be equally\npleased with himself. He was very glad, that the old & beloved town of Chota\nhad not been forgotten. Although when we arrived there we could not have\nseen his house any more, as the spot was covered with high grass, still we\nhad found it; - at this he rejoiced exceedingly. He was now alone- the other\nbeloved ones had not moved away-  but still they were gone, although\nthey had allways wanted to keep peace\". Pointing to the medal which\nhe wore, he said; \"this he wore in order allways to think of peace- the\nmedal had been given him by beloved men & for that reason he wore\nit- he would always preserve peace & never forget the good words of the beloved\nmen of the U. S. He would also retain our good words &deliver them to\nhis people. He intended never to leave Chota- here he would remain until\nhe died or would be killed.\" He then took hold of every one of us by the\nright arm & shook it.

Hereupon they returned to Salem.\n\n    Soon after the return of Mr. Hines the report he made was duly considered in the conference of the Directors Nov 12th in which the proposals submited were maturely weighed. The Country about James Vann marginally fixed upon for the Mission settlement & the necessary information being given to & full permission obtained from the Government, the Brethren Abraham Hines & Gottlieb Byhan Byham set out for the Cherokee Country April 13th 1801 & arrived at Mr Vanns near Connesauga Conasauga River on the 30th.\n    On the 12th of May Little Turkey brought Mr Hines a Letter of recomendation from Capt.

Mr. Vann directed his negroes to assist the brethren in building a Cabin upon the land appropriated for the use of the Mission to which they removed July 13th & accomodated themselves as well as circumstances permitted. The Brethren enjoyed every opportunity of becoming acquainted with the Indians & to accomplish the aim of their residence in the Country altho the difficult Cherokee language proved to be a great obstacle.

I took the earliest opportunity to ascertain if it were so, and found yours of Nov. 7. had been lodged there several months. We often meet with similar difficulties in obtaining letters from distant friends, therefore have requested that our address be Cleaveland, East Ten.  There we ought to have found your letter, as that post office is nearer than any other to Red Clay.\n  Had it come to hand, in due course of Mail, it would have been after Mr. Ross and his people were beyond my reach, so that they could have been no help in your present engagement, in proceeding with their History; but I could, in a measure, have relieved your mind of uncertainties, which must have been very perplexing. I have often thought of your laudable undertaking, and have not failed to sympathise with you, knowing how much you needed assistance from the friends of Cherokees in this region. But in looking round to devine some method to give you help it seemed that everyone, competent to such a task, had his head, heart and hands completely filled in striving to keep this poor oppressed people from being crushed into the dust. If some one, to gather facts, could have been placed among us from the 23 of May till the last of the Cherokees set their faces towards the West, then followed on with them to behold their misery and sorrows on their journey, the knowledge thus gained, would be of unspeakable value to place before the public. Besides recording what took place in their time, materials, to fill the deficient Chapters of your History, could have been obtained from the aged Cherokees, who had been gathered into camps, and who will soon leave this stage of action, and such knowledge, lost to the world. \n  I am much at a loss to judge what course I ought to pursue in reference to that part of your letter where you are wishing for materials to fill vacancies in your History. You say, \n\n\"Pray endeavor to convey to Mr. Ross my impression, that the Second Chapter, of which I speak ought to be very carefully prepared.\" If Mr. Ross was to attend to that, I am pretty sure he has failed in doing it, from the ixtreme pressure of his business. Of what you saw in Cherokee Council, you can form but a faint idea of the labours and perplexities that have fallen to his lot, since he returned from Washington. I have sometimes been astonished that he could preserve composure of mind, sufficient to transact business at all. When he returned from Washington, he found his people all prisoners, and considered himself one among the rest. He was however permitted to hold a general council with them in which they still protested against the treaty, though came to the conclusion to take the charge of their own removal, which\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          20","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70844,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70844","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c0c63034e09ef3c9c8d2a936d734580b.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/c0c63034e09ef3c9c8d2a936d734580b.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/c0c63034e09ef3c9c8d2a936d734580b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c0c63034e09ef3c9c8d2a936d734580b.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:46:01+00:00","modified":"2020-10-14T01:11:33+00:00","filename":"c0c63034e09ef3c9c8d2a936d734580b.jpg","authentication":"81d76970a09e4eda0df9059cb6024dc7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL05_FL020_00002_o2 copy.jpg","size":834566,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2280,"compression_ratio":0.067784762833008},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["112654+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["112654+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["112654+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c0c63034e09ef3c9c8d2a936d734580b.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424626,"FileSize":834566,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2280\"","Height":2280,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2280,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:12:38","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5093},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 11:26:54","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 11:26:54","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":76,"SubSecTimeDigitized":76,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2280,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1054,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1054","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Gen. Scott was very willing to transfer to them. Mr. Ross was chosen the Superintendent of this removal, and with accustomed confidence the Nation looked to him as their Principal Chief. From that time he took up his residence at the Agency only visiting his own home once in two or three weeks; and these generally obliged to accomplish the ride after he had finished the business of the day, and return as early as possible the next morning. In these visits, he would sometimes give us a hasty call, and when apprised of his being at home. The Doctr and myself have availed ourselves of the opportunity of calling on him. In one of these visits, I said, \"Now, Mr. Ross you need Mr. Payne to assist you in writing.\" He replied, \"Yes, I have thought of it, but so much jealousy exists in the minds of some, it might not prove a judicious plan in the end.\" Here I presume he alluded to a class of people who were endeavoring to break up the arrangement between Gen Scott and himself. In this class was a set of Speculators desiring offices in the removal. Some had been employed, by Government, and others stood by, asking appointments. But when the change was made, the Cherokees were appointed to every office, they were capable of filling. These Speculators with a determination  not to relinquish their expectations of gain, began to throw obstacles in the way, and retard the removal which they had before, been so anxious to hasten. As I have been informed, they thought one effectual means of doing this, would be, to create dissatisfaction among the lower class of Cherokees. with the movements of Mr. Ross telling things only a few of the most enlightened of their people would reap any benefit from the change. As their influence was not sufficiently extensive in this to effect their object, they artfully circulated an approval as originating with Mr. Ross for many Cherokees to return to their homes, particularly those who had dwelt in the mountains, to be removed at some future time; telling them they would then, receive better money for their valuations, with various other benefits. During these trying seasons, I have often wondered why Mr. Ross did not place them before the public, and have looked, but looked in vain to see them come forth in Northern papers. But I presume he had no time for this, and perhaps deemed it an unsuitable season, to stir up the wrath of his antagonists. I presume if letters have not been intercepted, the things I have stated, have stated, have been reasons why he has not corresponded with you, as was expected, I can not believe his silence is the result of any change of feeling towards you, however mysterious it may seem I have been trying to recall to mind the circumstances of my last call on him and his family; but such was the state of things, it almost seems like a dream. We had left business unfinished at the Agency to return home, and set his family on the move for Ross' Landing, where after finishing his business at the Agency, he was to meet them and take a water passage to the Arkansas. In the door yard, stood a number of men -- some had come with a view to purchase his cattle--some to purchase other articles, while others were seeking the \"preference right\" of entering his dwelling as soon as he left it. I entered the house, and every thing bespoke the speedy departure of the family. Mr. Ross endeavoured  to improve.

As I do not know where to address Mr. Butrick in that region, I will direct a letter to the Arkansas, that he may meet it on his arrival. I do not wait for your approbation of this movement, as the time has already passed, by which you wished to place your History before the public, and, your many hours brought it into a form in which you have done it, ere this and if so, Mr. Butrick send you further documents, they can probably be used in some way, for the benefit of the Indians.

One eighth have already gone down to the grave, since the 23rd of last May. And the number that is now dying, and  the distress of the living, while on the journey, with what they will doubtless be obliged to suffer, when they arrive in their new country, ought to stir up our Government to their effectual relief. I have heard of the number of deaths from only four companies since they left. Two of these, each containing about eleven hundred persons, had buried between fifty and sixty persons in each. Another with about one thousand persons had lost fifty two, and thirty eight from another, which, numbers seven hundred and fifty. These deaths had occurred when they had arrived, not quite half way.

When I reflect on them my soul is stressed within me. It seems that I cannot give myself rest, or let others rest, what can be made to lift up their voices in favor of making an exertion for their rescue.\n    Since my husband's absence, I have had but little time for writing, on the account of sickness in my family, and being obliged to give much of my attention to the concerns of the station. What little I could devote to this, I have employed in starting some particulars, of the manner, in which the Cherokees were taken -- The methods taken to wrest their remaining property from them & their sufferings while in camp etc. This was not to appear before the public, but to stir up the little circles of my friends in N. England. Mr. Butrick began to make minutes of these things to present to the public, but desisted, thinking the account might prove objectionable as he sometimes found a statement, when given by different persons  did not exactly accord in all its parts, and, as he was not an eye witness, felt that he should not be able to prove what he had asserted. But I think he would be able to furnish you with many interesting facts. Should you wish for his address, I think a letter would reach him directed Hedron Post Office Arkansas Cherokees.\n    When the Cherokees were first taken, I assisted Mrs. Hicks in writing a letter to her husband, then at Washington, making some statements of the proceedings. Mr.Hicks now returned since \n\nbefore it was copied. I read it to him, and he very much regretted that he could not have had it while in Washington, He requested me to transcribe it that he send it to you. As I was about to comply with this request my little infant son was taken sick, and after a few weeks, died. After this Mr. Hicks' time was wholly occupied in arranging his company for the West, and I did not again meet with him. The paper is now by me, in the original. \n\n   Mr. Samuel Gunter died at the Agency last fall. White Path died on his journey and lies buried in Kentucky.\n   I would not forget to tender my thanks for the interest you have expressed in the welfare of our dear children. My two little daughters, with whom you had some acquaintance, often speak of you, and now wish to send love. A little one not quite three years old,looks up, and says \"I want to write to Mr. Payne too.\" We have two Cherokee orphan girls in our family, formerly belonging to our school. They say \"We wish to be remembered to Mr. Payne for it is pleasant to hear from any one who feels for the distress of our nations, and we wish we were capable of giving him the assistance he needs in his History. \n                                                                                                      With much respect and sincerity yours -- Lucy A.

News reached us, yesterday, that Bell was collecting a company, to kill John Ross and Edw? Gunter A large company, collected here, at an hour's notice, and started at full speed to guard Mr. Ross, and another company from a few miles below, went, in like haste, to guard Mr. Gunter. \n    For the sake of humanity, it is to be hoped, the matter will stop here. For there can be no doubt, that should Mr. Ross or Mr. Gunter be killed, the popular fury will burst all the restraints imposed on them by the moderation of Mr. Ross, and nothing short, of the utter extermination of the treaty men, will satisfy them. \n    A General Council of the representatives and people of the Eastern and Western Cherokees, convened for the purpose of forming a union of the two Nations, and of remodeling their government, closed the 21st Inst., without affecting the objects for which it was conceived. The people, however, who formed a branch of the Genl Council, have expressed their sentiments on the subject.

They therefore called a National Convention, of the People of both Communities, to meet  at this place on the 1st of July, which assembled accordingly, and is yet in session.\n    In the interval between the call and the meeting of this Convention, those unfortunate men were killed. Upon which, their associates  assembled in arms & threat cries to kill Mr. John Ross and a number of others; although they well knew that these persons had no agency in the death of their friends. These threats roused the public feelings to a high pitch. The young men, with arms, rushed in from all quarters to see and hear and share the danger; & if necessary, to guard the lives of their friends.\n    When the news of Boudinotes death reached Mr. Ross, he was altogether unprotected, and ignorant of danger. He instantly sent over (about 1 1\/2 miles) to ascertain the fact, and received a friendly message from Mr. Boudinot, that his life was threatened, by Stand Mattie","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70852,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70852","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/0322d2c0e089242eaf918f05ae3aae0d.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/0322d2c0e089242eaf918f05ae3aae0d.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/0322d2c0e089242eaf918f05ae3aae0d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0322d2c0e089242eaf918f05ae3aae0d.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:46:09+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:15+00:00","filename":"0322d2c0e089242eaf918f05ae3aae0d.jpg","authentication":"589ab9c1840e7bf1be48fc683f2540ab","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL05_FL022_00002_o2.jpg","size":577727,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2281,"compression_ratio":0.04690332375339},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["112822+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["112822+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["112822+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0322d2c0e089242eaf918f05ae3aae0d.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424626,"FileSize":577727,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2281\"","Height":2281,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2281,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:12:40","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4259},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 11:28:22","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 11:28:22","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":77,"SubSecTimeDigitized":77,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2281,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1054,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1054","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Boudinot's brother.

A journal that one can pursue with interest & profit, requires a noble, useful life, - a life devoted to some high & special purpose.

Its teachings are not confined to anyone current of the literary art. These teachings are brought to bear upon life in all its relations: upon that which is true & beautiful: & that which is low & debasing. Boldly it sets its seal upon the principles of art & science; unclear it gives its opinion upon politics & the many thories of religious beleif; & often it speaks forth with a power that touches, & thrills as it were the great throbbing heart of the nations.

Those hands made a soft resting place for the lifeless  bird;  but ah! those hands had other duties to preform, & poor Fannie was quietly assigned to a more suitable & permanent repose.\n\nTuesday - Feb. 1st -\nAs this is the first day of the month, & the current month is the shortest one in the year, it seems quite suitable to write a short paragraph.

To me, as well as to thousands of others, who from various corners have been confined to the house all winter, the near approach of spring suggests pleasing thoughts & pleasant anticipations.  I am well aware that the reigns of Winter is wisely appointed.

No young sister tonight, waiting to read this little item as soon as it is finished;  as soon as I lay aside my pencil, which is - now!\n\nMonday - Feb. 7th -\nThis morning I had a special purpose in going to my drawer, which contains my papers & manuscripts.  I took out the little package of hymns & songs about which I have written in a previous paragraph.  I took off the rubber band;  added four more similar efforts to the number; & then laid them away again.  Now this may seem a very insignificant thing to do;  but to me it was associated with a mingled sense of gladness & regret.  I think we do a great many little acts in our daily life, which yields to us a peculiar pleasure, or sorrow, as the case may be.  I felt glad, this morning, that I had these four efforts to add to the list;  but sorry when I thought that these fourteen efforts, which are among the best I have ever written, were laying in my drawer useless.

Still I have remained indoors, busy with my writings and taking to my [poor?] heart, much that has been discouraging, [?] that I have found it difficult to brave and not complain. I sometimes think that I have [?] myself too closely to my occupations-that I have seen too much engrossed in my secular matters,-few as they are. And this I do know, better than any one can tell me, that I have not exercised, as much as I might have done,","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":78932,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/78932","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/828d1dc22804ebb5fb8ea975663f9f7f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/828d1dc22804ebb5fb8ea975663f9f7f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/828d1dc22804ebb5fb8ea975663f9f7f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/828d1dc22804ebb5fb8ea975663f9f7f.jpg"},"added":"2018-10-02T16:56:59+00:00","modified":"2020-04-23T13:59:36+00:00","filename":"828d1dc22804ebb5fb8ea975663f9f7f.jpg","authentication":"2ea679eb5c3adabda34a6ac84d5b1640","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_barnes_e_box_1_fl_7_2_19_1876_033_o2.jpg","size":1220093,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2874,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.03930813294157099735404159446261473931372165679931640625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171002"],"TimeCreated":["031444"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["844390"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171002"],"TimeCreated":["031444"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["844390"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171002"],"TimeCreated":["031444"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["844390"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"828d1dc22804ebb5fb8ea975663f9f7f.jpg","FileDateTime":1538499400,"FileSize":1220093,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2874\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2874,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:10:04 11:29:39","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333332999803833018859222647733986377716064453125,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:10:02 03:14:44","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:10:02 03:14:44","ShutterSpeedValue":4.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":1.75,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":85,"SubSecTimeOriginal":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3279,"ExifImageLength":4107,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803255,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["85\/1","85\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF85mm f\/1.8 USM"}}}},"item":{"id":1117,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1117","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"the gentle spirit of patience & forbearance.

It was a change for me -- a step outside the line of every-day life, & I enjoyed the evening very much. I was kindly invited to come again; but the winter has come & gone, & I have not yet accepted the lady's invitation. This was one Saturday night: & the next evening I went to church - the last time during all these long intervening months. I remember who spoke to me, & who took my hand in Christain welcome as I sat in my old chair; & how it made me feel that it was good to be in the House of God. That evening, a stranger occupied the pulpit. He was a young minister; but I distinctively remember that I did not see much that was ministerial about him. He was rude, harsh & noisy in his delivery; & to me, not very lucid or edifying in his religious views. No doubt, he was a good Christain, devoted to the Master's cause; & yet, his discourse did not suit me -- did not come to me with any new words of comfort, nor of Scriptural light. Perhaps it was my own fault. I might have been \"dull of hearing;\" or, it may be, that I did not appreciate the Gospel words & sentiments held forth for the believer's acceptance.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":78933,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/78933","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5db3bbe3c898fc63fe30715271fc2f0d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5db3bbe3c898fc63fe30715271fc2f0d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5db3bbe3c898fc63fe30715271fc2f0d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5db3bbe3c898fc63fe30715271fc2f0d.jpg"},"added":"2018-10-02T16:57:00+00:00","modified":"2020-04-23T14:13:34+00:00","filename":"5db3bbe3c898fc63fe30715271fc2f0d.jpg","authentication":"45d318bc09adc4767230ec7f095285df","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_barnes_e_box_1_fl_7_2_19_1876_035_o2.jpg","size":1196201,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2874,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.038538396608159997125397921990952454507350921630859375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171002"],"TimeCreated":["031455"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["844390"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171002"],"TimeCreated":["031455"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["844390"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171002"],"TimeCreated":["031455"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["844390"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5db3bbe3c898fc63fe30715271fc2f0d.jpg","FileDateTime":1538499400,"FileSize":1196201,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2874\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2874,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:10:04 11:29:43","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333332999803833018859222647733986377716064453125,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:10:02 03:14:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:10:02 03:14:55","ShutterSpeedValue":4.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":1.75,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":85,"SubSecTimeOriginal":82,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3279,"ExifImageLength":4107,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803255,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["85\/1","85\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF85mm f\/1.8 USM"}}}},"item":{"id":1117,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1117","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"This deficiency in the pulpit, however, had, for me, at least, its equivalent in the uplifting of earnest petitions & in the sweet singing of the choir.

I have good reasons for making the above statement. This book is not making a very rapid progress towards the goal of its completion; neither is there the slightest prospect that it will ever be published & given to the world.

June 5th--\nMy last paragraph was written as a simple tribute to the successive birth-days of my dear parents. And this bright June morning, I seat myself to write out a few thoughts upon that of sister Della's, which has just past & gone. It came to her last Saturday; & with the dawn of that morning, she welcomed the fact that she was seventeen years old. I told her that it was an interesting age; & indeed, it generally is,-- so full of health & promise; so full of sweet hopes & anticipations, known only to the giving, trusting heart, & reaching out, far out into the far-away future.

As may be presumed, these efforts have cost me much time & mental labor; & yet, generally speaking, I have written them quite easily. In their composition I can distinctively trace the hand of God -- the workings of His love & favor. I have often made them the subject of prayers; asking Him to help me, -- to guide & direct my thought, as He saw fit. In return, many is the time, when I have been composing, that line after line, in perfect rhyme & suitable sentiment, have come to me, as if some secret voice was whispering. I can describe it in no other way.

One of my every day privileges is to sit out in the yard, under a willow tree in my old chair. The sunshine is fine & glorious -- the breezes soft & sweet; & what little there is around me of green grass & leafy shade, rests & soothes me. I gaze up into the far-off sky, at times so blue & calm, at others, so dark & stormy. And I know that up, higher than the highest changing clouds, there is an eternal calm, rest & life.

But for all this, it will soon wither away, & its fragrance be gone. Flowers are frial things -- they only bloom to fade & die. This, my daughter, well knows. Yet, figuratively speaking, there is another boquet that I would have you judiciously cultivate now in your early youth, where your heart is fresh & untouched by sorrow, where your life is full of hope & promise. This boquet is unseen, & yet seen; invisible, & yet, visibly manifesting the unfading evidence of its presence. It is sweeter, richer & far more enduring","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":78955,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/78955","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d6de2f8e303afaee7ee7c6c1b6b7b84f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d6de2f8e303afaee7ee7c6c1b6b7b84f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d6de2f8e303afaee7ee7c6c1b6b7b84f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d6de2f8e303afaee7ee7c6c1b6b7b84f.jpg"},"added":"2018-10-02T16:57:58+00:00","modified":"2020-04-24T12:54:38+00:00","filename":"d6de2f8e303afaee7ee7c6c1b6b7b84f.jpg","authentication":"8dfb96126caba9f4218801b2076cbb93","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_barnes_e_box_1_fl_7_5_18_1876_029_o2.jpg","size":1066072,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2888,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0341794911254749977924660697681247256696224212646484375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171002"],"TimeCreated":["032318"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["844390"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171002"],"TimeCreated":["032318"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["844390"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171002"],"TimeCreated":["032318"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["844390"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d6de2f8e303afaee7ee7c6c1b6b7b84f.jpg","FileDateTime":1538499462,"FileSize":1066072,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2888\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2888,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:10:05 16:32:11","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333332999803833018859222647733986377716064453125,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:10:02 03:23:18","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:10:02 03:23:18","ShutterSpeedValue":4.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":1.75,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":85,"SubSecTimeOriginal":16,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3327,"ExifImageLength":4146,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803255,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["85\/1","85\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF85mm f\/1.8 USM"}}}},"item":{"id":1117,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1117","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"than the most elegant collection that we can gather from the flowers of Nature, freely as they are offered to us for that purpose, & lovely as they truly are in the wealth of their fragrance & beauty.

We are now able to give $200 a year, until the number of applicants is greater.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43810,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43810","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/0e1b9abf31aca0ea2e0753200219df78.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/0e1b9abf31aca0ea2e0753200219df78.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/0e1b9abf31aca0ea2e0753200219df78.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0e1b9abf31aca0ea2e0753200219df78.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-01T13:16:26+00:00","modified":"2020-05-14T17:27:36+00:00","filename":"0e1b9abf31aca0ea2e0753200219df78.jpg","authentication":"a3a7b0cc1e7a3064a41ba2db8aba02a3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_084_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1433794,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2965,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04477527949534700069111892162254662252962589263916015625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170807"],"TimeCreated":["221611"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170807"],"TimeCreated":["221611"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170807"],"TimeCreated":["221611"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0e1b9abf31aca0ea2e0753200219df78.jpg","FileDateTime":1509541908,"FileSize":1433794,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2965\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2965,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 11:38:51","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333332999803833018859222647733986377716064453125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:07 22:16:11","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:07 22:16:11","ShutterSpeedValue":4.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":30,"SubSecTimeOriginal":27,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3300,"ExifImageLength":4006,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":191,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/191","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Shall be happy to here from you at any time, or to see you, if you should be in this vicinity.

I did not think it would be so long a list as I mentioned only those in bloom & there are generally two or three different colors if the same flower.

                              Now Abby I supose you would like to know how I got home well I will tell you I left your house on monday for Uncle Mark's I staid with them untill thursday then Aunt Sophy carried me over to Eastman Belding's I staid with them untill the next tuesday morning I had quite a pleasant visit there but I did not feel so well contented there as I did at __Northfield or Warwick it was Hop time with them and they had 30 in the family I think it they had been alone that I should have enjoyed myself better Sumner and Erny had a fine time there playing with their little Boys (they were about there own ages) from Vernon I went to Concord to Sister Harriet's I arrived there at 2 o'clock in the afternoon found them all well and glad to see me they were pleased to hear from you all I told them that Mary and you was comeing down to visit us this winter but just as I told you they will not believe it untill they see you they wished me to give their love to you and tell you if you ever come they shall be happy t see you I also told them that I some expected your Mother and Charles down next month I don't know as I have much encouragement to expect them but Chandler said her would\n

I felt somewhat disapointed after I had read Ms. letter, for I full expected that letter would tell me the day you was coming. (By the way Mary did not direct her letter right, she directed it to Cambridge instead of Cambridgeport, and it was in that Office over a month before Part of it a friend of mine, saw it advertised and sent me word, I sent immediately and got it that-Office is about two miles from us). I supose M. thinks I am a long time answering her letter but as I have had it but a short time, I thought I ought to answer yours.\nfirst                 As you was a planning to go about a good deal this winter; if you came down here and to visit difference place; I supose it is all for the best that you have postponed your visit, for getting round much this winter is out of the question. \n      We have had an unusually sever Winter. I think I never experienced such a one before in my life; we have had 54 days of steady Sleighing; it is either snow , or the snow is so deep, that it is almost impossible for females to get out. I have not been able to get to Church (a very short distance) but twice since December. I should have been very happy to have had you visited me and set down here in my own pleasant home with me; but of course you would not have been contented to have done so, as you would wish to serve all alike.

I hope you are all well at home; we have all been uncomonly well the Boys have been to school ever day this month; they have their Examination next Friday, and after that a Vacation of a week, & They have not forgotten any of you at Warwick, they talk a great deal about you all, and Milly the Horse in particular. We were quite disapointed to hear that Mr. Bancroft, asked so much for his place, if he had offered it for two thousand dollars Sumner would have come up and looked at it, and no doubt would have bought it, three thousand dollars is a great price for his place so far in the country that would purchase quite a nice place near Boston. What did Mary mean when she said in her letter that she was glad to hear that we had made up our minds to come to Warwick to live. (I do not see much prospect of it as yet) I supose you would like to hear about the Cousins; they are all well as far as I know, Abbie Lamb's folks live in Boston this winter, she has been over here once this winter, and Agnes, has been here once, she is teaching school in Boston as usual. Fannie Stewart has been down and staid a fortnight with me and a very pleasant visit we had together. The Belding girls were all here in the fall and made me a visit, Annie and Sarah are at work in a Carpet Mill at Clinton about 40 miles from here. Emily is there also going to school. Brother Samuel and little Harriet are at North Chelmsford, the baby is at Somerville with sister Mary.    Mary wanted I should send her a couple of pieces, that Sumner spoke at the examination of his school. I think I will copy them of here and get you to send them to her if you please. I may not have an opportunity to write to her as soon as she wants them, if she gets home before I write to her, give my love to her and tell her to write to me, she can afford to write two letters to my one, as she has the most leisure time. We all send our love to you one and all. I hope you will not be so long answering this as I have been in answering yours.

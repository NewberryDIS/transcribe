I want very\nmuch Joseph that you should come here and go with me but\nI don't know as it will be expedient for you to come so soon because\nof the work at home Charles will have so much to do but you may\nbe thinking about it that will do no harm if you should not come do\ntry to be a good boy keep yourself neat and clean do wash your face and\nneck clean as often as twice a day at least all of you.  I had a while\nago considerable thought of having you Isaac come too this winter &\ngo to school at Andover where Caleb is there is a good school and very cheap.\nI suppose I could get a chance there where the whole expense for board\nand tuition would be more than a dollar a week but on the whole\nI do not now think it best the expense of getting here and back would\nbe so much and Eliab would be left almost alone but you\nmust certainly go to school somewhere so do try to be a very good boy\nthat Charles may be the better able to spare you - Almeda think\nI had better go to Warwick and stay 2 or 3 months and then come back &\nspend the winter here but I have not concluded whether I shall go to\nMilo this fall or not - I have not been to Lowell or Woonsocket or\nanywhere else scarcely since I came here what is the reason Isaac\nthat you have not written do set right about it and write me a good\nlong letter - Almeda wants Lucy to stay with her 2 years or more\nright side provisions? are very high there this summer but [page torn] 28 for him 23 cents","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98085,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/98085","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7c8aa0d9876ddc45cb9958ebc01295bf.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7c8aa0d9876ddc45cb9958ebc01295bf.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7c8aa0d9876ddc45cb9958ebc01295bf.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7c8aa0d9876ddc45cb9958ebc01295bf.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:44:31+00:00","modified":"2021-11-23T02:29:11+00:00","filename":"7c8aa0d9876ddc45cb9958ebc01295bf.jpg","authentication":"f4b246661641b4db1cb4dea5bd01982f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_86_003_001_o2.jpg","size":1699638,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2830,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05560914801727499801042853277976973913609981536865234375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["002735"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["002735"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["002735"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7c8aa0d9876ddc45cb9958ebc01295bf.jpg","FileDateTime":1587318188,"FileSize":1699638,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2830\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2830,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:39:18","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:11 00:27:35","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:11 00:27:35","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3448,"ExifImageLength":4385,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1237,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1237","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"have just receivd your letter Eliab I feel somewhat distress'd about Joseph  I have been expecting he would be sick  Sorry he took a lobelia had much better came right home I sent your Pants Jacket and 2 pr stockings by Mr Severance last week I suppose you got them sameday you wrote to me -

2nd\nMy Dear Son I thank you for your good letters to myself  & Ann-your letters generally have\nto much of incoherency & appearance of hurry about them whether it is for the want of time or\nto show that you are a \"business man\" I don't know but I think tis usually best to give yourself time\nenough to do whatever is worth doing at all - however I am very glad of anything from either of you.\nEliab has hardly written a word except what pertain'd to business & was absolutely necessary since he\nwent there perhaps he don't have time but it seems to me he ought to - I am afraid you work a \nlittle to hard or take to little rest and allow yourself to get nervous - take care and keep yourself cool\ncalm & steady - you are too sensitive and finespun to get along well in the crowd and stand your\nground among all the bustle & rebuffs that are unavoidable in a business life but you must\ntry to toughen your feelings and train yourself to it or stretch your feeling give way and let\nother people do as they please without being disturbed by it what if you are among\nsubject to the \"beck and bidding\" of such as you discribe try to be humble and faithful\nact the part of christian and you will find in almost everyone something that is\namiable and lovely you to much reasonable the misanthrope try to think much of your\nown fault but be very charitable to the faults of others you are fond of order and method\nand is in well to be so but do not let it carry you so far as to be fidgety by the want\nof it in others you will accomplish more business and do it better if you allow yourself \nsufficient rest and relaxation than if you keep yourself in a fever all the time with\nevery nerve strained - if you've got a good place don't get unease with it the\ninitiating or probationary state is in any case a state of trial & the greater the\ntrial the more find and fit for use the subject of it will be\nand if you are really gaining what will be very useful to you in after \nlife I would not grudge the time if you get but small wages a year or\neven 2 or 3 soon pass away but I stop this strain of advise lest your patience\nshould quite exhausted but one thing I want you should that is\nan errand to Mr Brown I was going to write to him, but can't well spare time\nit is to ask him to spare Eliab a few day and let him come home\nwith Charles, tell him I do want to see my baby very much indeed he never has been\ngone so long from me you know before, besides I think he absolutely needs to have\na few days or his health will suffer by it - it would be very bad for him to be sick there\n& if he should come home and the fresh air and relaxation might prevent it\nMary says tell him to come do I want to see him you cant think how she does enjoy\nherself flying about like a squirrel among the cows & calico pigs & chickens: Strawberries\netc. riding on Cate & Donkey she has inform'd herself more now about all the matters &\nthings on a farm, than Ann would in a year she lives upon strawberries & milk has grown\nfat and smart - I expected C. would go last thursday but it rain'd so that he could not go tell\nE that it will be just in good time for strawberries next week and do try to have him come.\nwritten across letter I meant to inquire about price of wooll but haven't had time Will if I can I express in figures on back or face of

If I had not been laughed at and discouraged, but had persevered, I might perhaps have been able, sometime, to write.  Perhaps it might have been well to let me alone - but I don't know as I regret bidding \"farewell.\" Very possibly I have employed my time and thoughts as usefully to myself and  others as if I had turned my attention to writing. Why don't you send me the rest of the Poetry which you spoke of? Do.\n   I am much obliged for the book you sent me. Tis a very good story, from which I have rec'd some useful hints, - though I think \"Anna\" is represented as a little too perfect - don't you? Your advice also is kindly received, understood, and its value appreciated. I have thought much lately of the trials, and especially of the responsibilities of a wife, and I feel that I am insufficient for them - utterly incompetent, in my own strength, to much, and bear up under them. But I hope to be enabled to lean upon One whose arm is strong, and to look to Him for grace to assist me in the right discharge of all my duties, whatever they may be. Will you not pray for me that I may be enabled to do so? I have probably much to suffer in my feelings - owing, in part to differences in our \"bringing up,\" which may lead to misunderstandings on both sides - though with no intention of unkindness. I know very little about the state of Samuel's finances, but he seems to speak as though there was no cause for fear in his business prospects. Mother says \"they that know nothing, fear nothing\"!

Kittredge lives but Mrs. Marshall will tell you she is a relative of his get Ann to go with you to purchase the Carpet and have it ready to send up by Samuel besure.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98137,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/98137","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4be729eb8fe61258b1516502fe07d414.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4be729eb8fe61258b1516502fe07d414.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4be729eb8fe61258b1516502fe07d414.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4be729eb8fe61258b1516502fe07d414.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:45:46+00:00","modified":"2021-11-30T17:51:52+00:00","filename":"4be729eb8fe61258b1516502fe07d414.jpg","authentication":"946aa76da8802ef55e2fb869ec8168cf","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_89_004_001_o2.jpg","size":1770845,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2897,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.056598940155205001989457969102659262716770172119140625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["031910"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["031910"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["031910"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4be729eb8fe61258b1516502fe07d414.jpg","FileDateTime":1587318191,"FileSize":1770845,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2897\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2897,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"16mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:41:50","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:11 03:19:10","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:11 03:19:10","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2678,"ExifImageLength":3327,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1237,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1237","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Sept. 27th 1848\n\nMy Dear Son\n\n   The enclos'd I sent by Charles but he forgot to hand it to you the errants are of not such immediate importance as to need attention till Charles goes down tho' I was sorry he didn't hand you the letter I'll send it along with this.

Or how can people live and enjoy health in regions where it is impossible to immerse or douche themselves\n I am thinking to go to Hampden in a week or two if I can and I hope to find you there. Your Habits have been such from your youth up that there cannot be much in your spleen that needs be wash'd out \n As you say there seems to be a strength in you notwithstanding your weakness that is very encouraging\n\n[upside down at top]when you want to come will not Isaac come to accompany you if you let him know - or Eliab if he dont or possibly Eliab & Lucy I should even like to myself if it didn't cost anything but do come soon unless you are satisfied that you are recieving benefit by staying there May God be with you My Son & bless you in all your doings.

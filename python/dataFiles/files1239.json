I had never seen it before. It will certainly afford much pleasure and instruction in connection with the perusal of Shakspeare - I do not progress very rapidly in reading Shakspeare  as my time for reading is quite limited at present. I have been absent from home so much, that now, parents, brothers and sister claim considerable of my time.

There is occasionally a day when he seems more comfortable, but the next day is almost sure to bring something new and unfavorable. I commenced school again the day after you were here, but I never found it so difficult to give my school my thoughts before; have been home every other day, thus far.\n\nNewberry N.H.

1850\n\nMy dear friend,\n\n Your last kind letter was received and read with unusual interest.  Since then my time has been very full occupied. Mother has been almost sick, and we have had much company.  After my brother's death, all the days seemed like Sabbaths it was quite a task for us to engage in our usual duties, but that feeling is wearing away.  I do hope other impressions, made by that event and more desirable to be retained will not as speedily depart. and I cannot think they will.  Another world does seem nearer, and tho paths that leads us thither seems brighter, and this earth too, seems fairer than ever.  It does not appear the dark wilderness which some, who have known sorrow, feel it to be.  I know not why.  I should love to think ( if I dared;) it is because I see more than ever before, God in all things.  \n\nNow that one loved brother \"is not\" because God has \n[written along side]\nYour brother is recovering, I hope your own health will not suffer from over- exertion.  I think you deserve a few hours of leisure every week at least. \nVery truly Antoinette. \n\nNewbury, N.H.

I always delight to receive a letter, but thrice welcome they always seem, when I am away from home. But I never attended a school before, where the idea of home seemed so linked with everything. Mr. Russell says he intends this to be, emphatically, a family school. There are about 60 pupils, and I believe more than 50 are members of the family; that is,  they board and room in the Institute building. Some of the rooms are very convenient and pleasant. I had, of course, engaged to be content with one of poorest,  but I prefer this to being deprived of the privilege of being connected with the family of the Principal.\n     My room mate is Miss Catherine McKeen.  Her home is in Bradford Vt. where her father is settled as a minister. She has been a teacher recently in Haverhill, N.H. - and left her situation then, in order  to avail herself of Mr. Russell's instruction during the winter. She is a fine scholar. is intelligent\n\nBangor Dec. 10. 1850\n[left-hand side and top] It seems you are busied again both day and evening. I think it would it would be very pleasant to you to be employed this winter so near your friends, particularly as you find your sister still so weak and helpless. We had a box from home yesterday. It contained a number of articles which we had requested to be sent, besides apples and butter. We had a nice time opening it. Father and mother and Jenny are all as well as usual. I do not know but the sight of this epistle will weary you but there came to be a great many things to write about in connection with school affairs. George sends respects. He sits by me, working examples in Greenleaf's Arithmetic.

Gentlemen are not allowed to visit the ladies' rooms, at all, but Mr. Ray, one of the teachers, gave George permission to come and see me, at any time, not in study hours. So he comes quite often, sometimes to obtain assistance about some lesson, sometimes to bring wood for us, and sometimes just to talk, or to read with me, our letters from home. This adds greatly to our happiness. This afternoon I have prepared a written translation in French, {which our teacher requires of the class every Saturday}.

This is followed by Declamations, Compositions, and the Recitation of Poetry by the ladies. The latter is something new to me. I have not yet attempted it. The ladies take their stand upon the stage, to read compositions, and recite poetry. The exercises of these two evenings are voluntary, but Mr. Russell is very anxious that all should take part in them and most are perfectly willing.  The exercises are, usually, very interesting.\n\n   Wednesday evening, Mr. Russell give a lecture on English Literature, which is followed by what is termed regulated conversation. Some subject is announced beforehand, and all are invited to unite in discussing it, Last Wednesday, each one was requested to describe the scenery about their homes. We had not yet been very sociable on these evenings, but I hope we improve a little, as these weeks pass. Thursday evening we spend half an hour in the practice of sacred music, and then Mr. Russell communicates all the interesting and important items of general intelligence, gathered during the week from newspapers etc. He dwells particularly on what is connected with the progress of Science and Art. Saturday evening we spend in reading or writing to friends. Sabbath evening we have a lecture from the minister of the place (Mr. Little) or from some neighboring minister; or, a biblical lesson. Last Sabbath evening, Mr. Seymour, who was City Missionary at Manchester, lectured , & he is coming again tomorrow eve. He intend to give a series of lectures. on the character and condition of the Indian. He hopes some students will be willing to go and labor among them as missionaries. Perhaps you have heard him speak. I do love to listen to him, notwithstanding all his peculiarities. I think him a truly good man - heartily engaged in the work of doing good.\n  The first Sabbath I was here, it stormed, and, as we are two miles from church, and must walk, I did not attend. Mr. Russell met us all in the lecture room, and read a sermon. This, he usually does, when the weather is unpleasant. But this did not make it seem like Sabbath to me. The first two weeks seemed like one long week, without a sabbath. I am quite sure I shall not stay from church when the weather and walking are suitable. It seems strange ti be so far from the meetinghouse. Heard Mr. Little preach last Sabbath, and was much interested in his sermons. He is not a great man. I should not think his education thorough, but his thoughts are good - his manner earnest - and impressive.\n    Mr. Russell reads a sermon so well that it is as interesting as to hear many men, preach. Some of the scholars seem to rejoice to have a stormy Sabbath.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98378,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/98378","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/9f31dc837c3d806c1916f2c811e059d8.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/9f31dc837c3d806c1916f2c811e059d8.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/9f31dc837c3d806c1916f2c811e059d8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9f31dc837c3d806c1916f2c811e059d8.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T18:15:52+00:00","modified":"2020-07-14T18:51:09+00:00","filename":"9f31dc837c3d806c1916f2c811e059d8.jpg","authentication":"1d0951bc1d0ccfae7436d2f181245a78","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_103_016_001_o2.jpg","size":1230029,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2291,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049712603262363},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["035559"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["035559"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["035559"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"9f31dc837c3d806c1916f2c811e059d8.jpg","FileDateTime":1587320039,"FileSize":1230029,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2291\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2291,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:47:37","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:11 03:55:59","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:11 03:55:59","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1761,"ExifImageLength":2766,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1239,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1239","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"A days routine.\nRise at half past five.\n\nFrom 6 1\/2 to 7 1\/2   _________ Study.

The old year is almost gone - a year full of event - a year long to be remembered. I think of dear Henry to night, and he does not seem far away.  Has he not just begun to live? Miss McKeen, my room mate, buried her only brother last June. We feel that we can share each others' sorrows, & that we can rejoice together too. Those dear lost ones are not sad tonight, and we should not be sad for them, though it seems, sometimes hard to \"live without their vanished light.\" O how little we dreamed, one year ago this night, what the year was bringing for us.

The morning of the new year has come - bright - and beautiful - May it be to thee a happy one.\n  The new -year's wish has echoed, merrily, through the halls of our building this morning, and has followed many a tap at our door. I could not help wishing, silently, that all these hearts, now so light and happy, might know the true source of all real joy.\n But I must not stop this morning to write much. I have\n\n[left-hand side and top] Brother George will return next term. This term has three weeks after this, and one week only of vacation succeeds. The rooms in the building are fast being engaged. I have as yet received no instructions from my several guardians and counsellors, as to whether I shall secure, a room for the coming term. It will be soon be too late to do so, if I should wish. Mr. Ray thinks the entire building will be occupied by ladies next term. The applications are greater than at any given time. I will direct to Milo, since you were there when you wrote. I love to have a letter. The first half of the days that intervene, I think of the one just received, and the last half of the one I hope is coming. O I meant to tell you how many letters I wrote last year - 61 and I received 59. More than usual I think.

I rose at five this morning have had a nice walk, and have finished copying my composition, to hand Mr. Russell this morning, and now I can write a letter with a light heart duty before pleasure, you know is the maxim.  I have plenty of compositions to write.  Our Rhetoric scholars bring in one every Monday morning, the French class prepares one every other Saturday and occasionally one must be prepared for the exercises of Tuesday & Friday evening.  In addition to this, for the last two weeks, the class in Retoric have prepared one nearly every day.  So my mind has been quite closely occupied.  Wherever I go and whatever I do, I am thinking continually of composition.  I think it has been very profitable to me, though it is somewhat, wearisome.  I suppose we shall have a little change in our exercises this week, which will be very agreeable.  I have read two compositions, on the stage, and sung twice.  Is not that considerable for little Nettie to do\u00a0?  We have quite a company of visitors, on Tuesday and Friday evenings. Last Friday, a large company came from Manchester.  We have frequent visits from friends of education.  Since I wrote, prof. Samuel Willow, an elocutionist, has been here.  Dr. T.S. Lambert has been here, and delivered six very interesting lectures on Physiology.  He is from New York city but is lecturing in Boston this winter.  \nI feel much happier than at first, for I am now acquainted with the scholars and feel interested in them.  I enjoy the society of my room mate more and more every day.  \nThe weather is warmer now, and our room is very comfortable besides we have substitute for a carpet on the floor and have nailed a shawl over one window.  so we keep quite warm\nBrother George has been sick for three days.  We took a severe cold and was very feverish.  I felt very anxious about him, the first two days, but the load is somewhat lightened to day for he is much better, though not yet quite able to go down to the school room.  He seems quite interested in study.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98384,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/98384","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/be2bcec2fea8eac87d9e5a04b3cbec76.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/be2bcec2fea8eac87d9e5a04b3cbec76.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/be2bcec2fea8eac87d9e5a04b3cbec76.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/be2bcec2fea8eac87d9e5a04b3cbec76.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T18:16:00+00:00","modified":"2020-07-14T20:30:00+00:00","filename":"be2bcec2fea8eac87d9e5a04b3cbec76.jpg","authentication":"3197d0022e8aa23b645fa08ea90411a3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_104_001_001_o2.jpg","size":1725414,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2913,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.054843994354808},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["225242"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["225242"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["225242"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"be2bcec2fea8eac87d9e5a04b3cbec76.jpg","FileDateTime":1587320039,"FileSize":1725414,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2913\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2913,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:47:47","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:12 22:52:42","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:12 22:52:42","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":47,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3477,"ExifImageLength":4296,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1239,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1239","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Merrimack Normal Institute, Feb. 6, 1851\nMy dear friend, \nMore than three weeks since, did I dispatch a letter in reply to yours received Jam. 8, and never  a word have I received in return, though I have listened most intently, and questioned the East Wind of it burden;  You must be, methinks, as weary way off that your answer should be so long in journeying.

I do not now how I could live without somebody to tell me always what to do .  The expenses of this term for board, tuition & books have been a little less that  $29.00 .Not as much as I expected.  I was not able to attend to drawing, because the teacher in that branch has been sick all the term so that I have ample means to stay another term, if it is thought advisable. My term has passed very pleasantly and profitably, although I regret, as usual, that I have not made much more progress.  We are to have but one week of vacation. I spoke to Mr. Ray, who has charge of the boarding, to reserve a room until I should know if I returned. This was some time since, but I still think there will be rooms, because preference is given to those who have previously attended.

I write now, with totally different feelings.

Not so - indeed, for it quite delighted me. I have pictured, in my mind, a most enchanting scene of life in the woods, which I shall always love to look upon. I wonder not that you enjoyed it much for the time.

Besides Mr. Russell's illness, I could have had no advantages in Drawing, for tho the daughter of Mr. R., who instructs in this branch, is sick also  - has been out of health for a long time. I have decided, with my parents advice, to go over to Concord, in a few days, and spend perhaps three weeks there, in a very excellent family; that of Mrs. French, the widow of a missionary to Sian. I shall have the advantage of good society, some time for reading, and shall receive instruction in Drawing and Painting. I think I may spend the time profitably and pleasantly.\n\n  When I came home, I felt exceedingly desirous to return to the Institute, particularly on account of the advantages there afforded for pursuing the study of History, and also of Elocution. but Mr. Russell's illness would have prevented my receiving the anticipated benefit. He was to have charge of the students in History, this term.

Day before yesterday I went, with Mrs. French, to visit a lady in the village, in company with Rev. Mr Ransom and wife, who are now living in Bennington N.Y. but were formerly Missionaries on Western ground.  I enjoyed the time there spent very much.  Mrs. Ransom is an excellent woman, constantly endeavoring to do good.  And then the family we were visiting, it is indeed a model family.  There are three of the sweetest children I ever saw decidedly. You would enjoy spending a half day there, to witness the love, order, and obedience which reign so perfectly.  Happy parents, happy children.  Each face, silently, but impressively, told me of the quiet joy within.  Since making this visit, I have attended the \"Ladies\" Missionary Meeting\".  They commence with Scripture reading, and prayer, and occupy the time afterwards in sewing, while some one of the members reads interesting Missionary Intelligence.  These are some of the very best of people in the place.\n\n  Last evening I spent very happily with Mrs. French.  She has a great variety of curious articles which she brought home from Siam, when she left the Mission Station there.  She exhibited them,","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98396,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/98396","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/0916171ee8153cad419d3516c43a523f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/0916171ee8153cad419d3516c43a523f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/0916171ee8153cad419d3516c43a523f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0916171ee8153cad419d3516c43a523f.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T18:16:17+00:00","modified":"2020-07-15T19:25:59+00:00","filename":"0916171ee8153cad419d3516c43a523f.jpg","authentication":"db38c19c07a6dcd88be7f1a5c9b33b2b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_104_004_003_o2.jpg","size":1638509,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2721,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.055756632229436},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["225426"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["225426"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["225426"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0916171ee8153cad419d3516c43a523f.jpg","FileDateTime":1587320040,"FileSize":1638509,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2721\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2721,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:48:14","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:12 22:54:26","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:12 22:54:26","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":47,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3292,"ExifImageLength":4355,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1239,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1239","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"and explained their use to me.

We usually open the doors for a time to hear their music more plainly. We need no caged birds to sing to us - for we have the \"merriest trills\" of the happy, free songsters.\n\n            I have been tracing out on the map, the various railroads you have mentioned. I should think it would puzzle you to recollect the names of so many, and yet they seem to be constantly multiplying. You ask if I should not prefer to be in New England. I should indeed. I hope you will be able to obtain the situation on the Hartford and Fishkill road, which you think would suit you so well.  Perhaps this delay, which seems so unpleasant, will secure you the very place you will like best. I do hope you will not be low-spirited, and I think you cannot be very low, for I imagine you are one of those who \"carrieth his sunshine with him.\"  You say you do not wish to get upon another such road at the N.H. Central. Now let me whisper in your ear, that I feel quite happy that you were once located thereon.\n     I think I was at Concord when I last wrote. I painted three pictures while there - two were quite large. Two were landscapes and the others a representation of a little boy \"tired of play\"- I enjoyed my stay at C. very much.

The spring weather is said not to be very good for those in feeble health. It seems to affect Mother somewhat, but I think she will be well as usual, when Summer comes.\n   I need not say I should have been happy to see you at D. But I do not much wonder that you did not come, for I think Dunbarton may be as difficult of access as was the place you mention where you found your relatives in N.Y., and I do not know as there is any prospect of anything better.

July 20 I think I will send this letter by Mr. Wallace to be mailed at Manchester tomorrow - it may reach you a little more seasonably. It could not go from here till Tuesday afternoon. You will see, by the dates, that this sheet is somewhat ancient but I think I'll send it notwithstanding. I hope you have not been sad any to day, though probably you could not attend meeting. I have been watching the Western clouds, and thinking of my dear friend, away towards the setting sun. I wish I could do something to make you happy to night. Well, this letter is surely long enough. I only wish it were better. Write please as often as you can with your many duties, and tell me your pleasures, and plans, and troubles too.\nDo not forget that I have not written for a long while, and pardon the length of this.\nFrom your own, Antoinette.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98403,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/98403","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/cac020bd220da4022eb7b2f99c4ccf4c.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/cac020bd220da4022eb7b2f99c4ccf4c.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/cac020bd220da4022eb7b2f99c4ccf4c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cac020bd220da4022eb7b2f99c4ccf4c.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T18:16:26+00:00","modified":"2020-07-15T20:46:09+00:00","filename":"cac020bd220da4022eb7b2f99c4ccf4c.jpg","authentication":"bb9a9c82716875320ca45d5187c1bf9b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_104_006_002_o2.jpg","size":1549866,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2937,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048861461052472},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["225516"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["225516"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["225516"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cac020bd220da4022eb7b2f99c4ccf4c.jpg","FileDateTime":1587320040,"FileSize":1549866,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2937\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2937,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:48:29","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:12 22:55:16","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:12 22:55:16","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":47,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2959,"ExifImageLength":3626,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1239,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1239","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"as you wish.

I know how to sympathise, truly. I sued to drink as seldom and as rapidly as possible, for it seemed unendurable.

I may have mentioned in a previous letter, that George is going to Meriden Academy. He expects to be admitted as a beneficiary there. We feel very glad of this, for now he can study without embarrasment. Father thinks he will stay three years if his health should be good. He has nearly decided not to send him to College, but to have him pursue an independent course, that he may avoid spending time with branches which will be nearly or quite useless to him. What think you of this plan? I cannot tell you how much I enjoy his being at home, but the pleasure will soon be past.

It is, moreover, an old thought - in a new dress- 'Tis this - \"I am a part of all that I have met.\" It is a solemn thought that we leave impressions on all we meet, as well as receive them.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98415,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/98415","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/6f70594b1c8b5b7d225760cc109c6af5.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/6f70594b1c8b5b7d225760cc109c6af5.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/6f70594b1c8b5b7d225760cc109c6af5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6f70594b1c8b5b7d225760cc109c6af5.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T18:16:43+00:00","modified":"2020-07-16T02:19:20+00:00","filename":"6f70594b1c8b5b7d225760cc109c6af5.jpg","authentication":"ce0d44ce2bfe381823e73cf8e413d9b8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_104_008_005_o2.jpg","size":1613199,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2762,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.054080477109985},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["225644"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["225644"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180712"],"TimeCreated":["225644"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6f70594b1c8b5b7d225760cc109c6af5.jpg","FileDateTime":1587320041,"FileSize":1613199,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2762\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2762,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:48:55","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:12 22:56:44","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:12 22:56:44","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":47,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2945,"ExifImageLength":3838,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1239,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1239","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Tuesday-}\n\n  I think I spoke, in a previous letter, of a visit from a very dear friend - Emilie Peavey.

Since I last wrote she has been here, and spent a little more than a week. After she left another old friend of my school days came, and passed several days, and last week my uncle, a brother of mothers, pastor of a church in Bridgewater, Mass. came and made us a visit, with his wife. They had just been to Westboro' where my mothers relatives reside, to attend the funeral of my grandfather Brigham. He died Sept. 15, and was buried on the afternoon of the 16th. He was in his 90th year. Brother George and I went to see him last Spring. He talked a good deal with me - one thing he said was, \"I am tired of living, and I hope I am going very soon to a better world.\" He stood by me tremblingly leaning on his cane,as he said this, but his eye was undimmed and bright, and the quiet joy of a peaceful, happy spirit seemed beaming through it. As he turned and walked slowly away, tottering, and seeming almost afraid to stop, I could not but be thankful that though the earthly tabernacle was soon to be dissolved he has in reserve, as we confidently hoped, \"a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.

This does more good than anything else, I believe. We are happy enough I assure you, to have her sit with us again at table, sew a little, talk as usual, and tell Jenny and I - (the housekeepers) how and what to do, hen we are at a loss to know. It is very pleasant to have a counsellor. I am having a very easy comfortable time now, with just enough to do. School is done, and Jenny can help considerable, and little cousin Hattie is gone home to her parents, so that we are but four.    \n  We had another letter from George, two or three days since.

I enjoyed the ride and the glorious Autumnal scenery very much. It seemed to me 'tho trees had never before assumed colors so lifelike so brilliant and lustrous. No wonder the poor foreigners thought America had painted trees. The leaves already begin to fall, and while I write, they drop, one by one, from the maple trees by the door. Father says he does not love to think summer is gone - he likes the warm weather. Does it seems any like New England where you are at Mr. Root's? Or, have they become thoroughly westernized by this time? Does he have a considerable audience to listen to his Sabbath Service? I was much interested in the story of your Sabbath experience. I have never attended a Class meeting - but from what I have known about them I have formed a very favorable opinion.  Mother has attended them, and has often said she thought a similar service would be of great benefit to any people.\n Very glad you found so good and kind a friend in Dr. Lucas and hope his care and prescriptions have made you much better ere this. I suppose it will be some time before you will be fully well and strong again, even if you recover as rapidly as could be expected. It seems as if I could hardly wait for your next letter, to tell me how you are. I believe I mentioned in the last letter, that I should be glad to hear once in two weeks. Perhaps you will think this altogether too great a demand on your time. If so, of course I would be unwilling to have it so, - but a very short letter will do a very great deal of good. I am writing in father's study now, and I do wish you could hear the music. It is a delightful day; warm as summer, and the buzzing fly, the chirping cricket & the \"hum-drum grasshopper\" are performing each their part, and a merry little bird perched on the topmost bough of a maple tree, plays an interlude occasionally. But I must stop, or the mail will be gone. But one thing I had almost forgotten. Father wished me to ask whether, if you decide to remain West, Minnesota would not be as promising a field of labor? I suppose it is far healthier- perhaps even a better climate than New England. I believe father thinks it, perfection.

Yours, dated Oct. 12, reached me to night. I have been wishing I could have a letter, all day long, but not daring to expect one. So it was all the more welcome. I do thank you for writing so fully about your health, though I have been feeling very sadly to think how sick you have been. But I have just concluded that I ought to be very, very thankful that you were better. - So the dark clouds have disappeared, & the sunshine gleams just enough to let me begin to write. I think it is quite as well that you mailed the letters you refer to, without adding that the Ague, with all its horrors had really come; for we should have felt an increased solicitude. I do hope it may have left you entirely; thought I cannot help fearing a return. Very great care must be necessary. How very fortunate that you were at Mr. Root's, where you found your\n\n[left-hand side and top] Father seemed better to day - he came out and ate breakfast with us this morning. If he takes no cold I think he will soon be well as usual. A week or two ago, he took Jenny and me to his woodlot to help him find the \"lines\". We purchased the lot about a year since, and thought the boundary was pointed out to him then, he had been there alone since and could not trace it. When we got there, he told me the direction as well as he could, and found one one marked tree; and then called me the Engineer {now, wasn't it ministerial,} and said I must go ahead and find the lines. O scrambled along bushes and brambles and fallen trees and across running streams {not very large ones}, and did my best so did we all, but the marks on two sides, we could not find, and gave it up. But we had delightful ramble, and a fine ride and came home in high spirits- bringing a part of the forest with us- specimens of the brilliant, many-colored Autumn leaves.

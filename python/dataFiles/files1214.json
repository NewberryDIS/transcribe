I like my boarding place very well, find it very convenient for school and meeting, as to singing, we have some fine times we have almost a choir among ourselves, there are five young gentlemen. - boarders all singers, one plays on the flute, the eldest daughter plays on the piano elegantly, Harriet 19 years old, sings beautifully and plays some Anna 9, sings well, and Caddy (Caroline) three, can sing 'O be joyful' at a rate great: the father and mother are both singers, so we make some noise sometimes.\nI am somewhat surprised to hear of Ellen's engagement, guess it suits her: I should not think Olive and Jo Hill would go well together Theodore F is a fool to choose a Heald before Naomi but there is no accounting for such matters:-\nI suppose Mother and Almeda wo'nt feel slighted that this letter is all directed to you since they neither wrote any to me in the one to which this is an answer.\n[right-hand side]My love to all the folks?

O' what a terrible affliction my poor brother! How will he bear it? The grace of God only can enable him. 'Affliction springs not from the dust' some wise purpose is to be answered!- Joseph when a child as I distinctly remember was a very mild, gentle, and loving, and rather remarkable for a sweet and confiding disposition. In the later years of his manhood I have sometimes sighed at the apparent change in him (I mean only a lack of the social, communicative spirit of his boyhood could perhaps by buffering the cold, calculating, selfish world steeling the mind, repressing its finer sensibilities, or as he expressed it, \"toughening the feelings?\" The stern force of circumstances modify the character much; they form the root of the great Architect to mould and form us to fit us for his service! Had Providence ordered favoring circumstances, J. would undoubtedly have been rich: his business talents, cast and turn of mind, ready and stiff decision, bent of purpose, strict integrity, quick seeing sagacity, all would lead to such results, but very possibly success would have been attended with scorching indifference on the mind and heart, mocking  every green thing to become withered and sere. Dear Joseph, great was your danger, but your Heavenly Marker counts the spirit with which he had endeavored you, too precious to be abandoned to the cold indifference of worldly prosperity!","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94124,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94124","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/f117dfa0f169b9000388a961ef6ef3fe.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/f117dfa0f169b9000388a961ef6ef3fe.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/f117dfa0f169b9000388a961ef6ef3fe.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f117dfa0f169b9000388a961ef6ef3fe.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:42:47+00:00","modified":"2020-10-17T01:49:59+00:00","filename":"f117dfa0f169b9000388a961ef6ef3fe.jpg","authentication":"09aa3b7c4b0f258d6578db2e5c4af35e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_02_001_004_o2.jpg","size":1520495,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2853,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049346853864029},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180529"],"TimeCreated":["233534"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180529"],"TimeCreated":["233534"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180529"],"TimeCreated":["233534"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f117dfa0f169b9000388a961ef6ef3fe.jpg","FileDateTime":1586648536,"FileSize":1520495,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2853\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2853,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:22:35","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:29 23:35:34","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:29 23:35:34","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3057,"ExifImageLength":3857,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1214,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1214","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"So you, my dear sister, had your childhood and youth been passed in the full tide of health and luxurious self-indulgence, would your spirit now be tender and loving, your disposition amiable and kind?

So Joseph and we all may have cause to bless the afflictive rod which at present seems so dark and trying.

I think of sending for a letter of dismission from the church, for if I should return there before long. I should prefer being in the other church I think: you of course have not been at a meeting for a long time. I have felt a little worried about Elias for some time, hope he may have wisdom given him at this important time in his life. If you will write me once in two weeks I will answer as often, as I can. every particular I want to hear. How is and where is Jane?  Are the children learning this summer.\n[right side] I have just received 3 quires of paper like this sent to Buffalo at .11 a quire.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94166,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94166","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/6daeb1bde77237259746250e7050158f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/6daeb1bde77237259746250e7050158f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/6daeb1bde77237259746250e7050158f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6daeb1bde77237259746250e7050158f.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:43:43+00:00","modified":"2020-10-17T02:54:43+00:00","filename":"6daeb1bde77237259746250e7050158f.jpg","authentication":"2ede7a02d1c217448fd675e1feb58b7e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_02_012_004_o2.jpg","size":1378534,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2888,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044197381245511},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180529"],"TimeCreated":["234124"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180529"],"TimeCreated":["234124"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180529"],"TimeCreated":["234124"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6daeb1bde77237259746250e7050158f.jpg","FileDateTime":1586648538,"FileSize":1378534,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2888\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2888,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:24:00","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:29 23:41:24","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:29 23:41:24","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"SubSecTimeOriginal":95,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3085,"ExifImageLength":3845,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1214,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1214","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Ann Oct. 1851\nof whom she gave you an account.

First I have for four weeks past, been engaged in teaching the centre district small school.  I board at the Taylor's:  My school consists of about 36, mostly under ten years of age.  It is far more fatiguing than any school I ever taught, though a pleasant and forward one;  I have a class in Olney's\" & Parley's Geography\n& on Colburn and the Child's Arithmetic, none either in Grammar or writing.  My Boarding place is in every respect pleasant:  Dr Taylor is a very pleasant and social man, though one would hardly suppose so from a slight acquaintance with him: and you know what a kind and good, as well as agreeable woman, Mrs. Taylor is; they have quite recently been called to mourn\u00a0; their youngest daughter, a bright and lovely Child of eight years died in fits, very suddenly, the day before I came here to board;  Mrs. T. feels very deeply she wishes me to give her love to you, & wishes you would remember her at the throne of Grace in reference to her affliction that Sarah now the only daughter, is a young lady of a good mind, and truly amiable manners. they have five fine smart boys; the two youngest attend my school.  i spend the evenings chiefly in reading and study, have plenty of good books, they board the master too, and keep two fires; My wages are quite small only $1,00 per week but that is better than none, and I am more pleasantly situated as to means of improvement, than I should be at any of my uncle's; the time however is short, but four of five weeks longer, after which I think I shall visit Royalston and Troy to stay a week or two, and what my course will be then, I know not.  My last letter to you was dated at Aunt Conant's I spent three weeks there very happily  I did most all my own sewing, cut & made Aunt a hood and assisted Ann Whitney in cutting a dress like one of mine,  & visited at Ms. W. while there, the only visit except one, which I have made here.  I have yet spent much time at Grandmother'd except a day when Aunt Coleen was there she staid one week in town came without husband or children.  I should thing there was a great change in her.  I heard her say very little upon religion, but Eliza Rink told me that she talked with Grandmother considerable, spoke of the manner their family had been brought up, & said\n[right side of page top to bottom]\nI returned from Northfield day before Thanksgiving which I spent at Uncle Steven's the evening at Aunt Conant alone with Uncle & Aunt & C.

My dress is very much warmer this winter than it was last; though the weather is much more mild.\nI think there is little doubt but I can have chances to keep common School? about here next summer but the wages for the largest & most fatiguing would not exceed 1,50 a week. A Select School would be far more pleasant, and probably far more profitable; I think I had better make exertions very early in the season, to get up such a School in this region, --in Winchester; -- if these exertions fail of success, direct my course to Bangor in season to try there, --or -- if that should be inexpedient;-- soon enough to engage in a common school, in your region. The most agreeable course would be to go to Milo spend a few weeks and then engage in a private Sch. in Bangor.

We are all perfectly well; Lucy has been well ever since you went, (she got better immediately) but her mind is not so much upon her studies as it was last summer she is devoted to play, she would like to play from morning to night, & like all other little girls every thing else is irksome to her  I am not sure but it would have been the way of duty for you to have taken her home with you for I am afraid the benefit to her will not balance the expense and sent Isaac here instead, he could help A. so much that Almeda could take him at a less price, and it would be a lasting and decided benefit to him.  James & Almeda think they can't afford to take Isaac for less than it would cost them, and they say it would actually cost (washing etc.) as much as $1 2\/4 per week, Almeda says that L's board costs more than $1.25 every week, that she don't need his help at all, and that she considers she is actually giving it, but she says she and James are willing to give one of the children their board to go school, all the time, but can't have but one at a time. etc.  It does not seem just so to me about Lucy, though to be sure Almeda could get along with out her as well as not, and it takes expense and time to keep her decent here, but if you had taken Lucy home you could afford to pay a low price for Isaac's board, and then would not be so much obligation felt;

It is to have Mayo (Isaac is too old) come right here immediately and enter if he can the free Eng. High School;  A. can afford to board him without much expense & there would be no direct expense out except his clothes;  There would be just the studies and discipline of mind that he needs, he could leave at any time, and not better recommendation could be found to get him into any good pace than coming from the High School,  These are the advantages, but the great thing is it would save more than half the expense, and he be more favorably placed, as to influence religious, & intellectual, than we could expect to have him any where else;  The school at Andover is not less than $6,00 tuition, & board 2 or 3 dolls unless they should board in common  which Caleb says is not the best thing for boys;  he says the school at Andover is the best about heres and Isaac could still go, there a while, and he being older could probably more readily find employment than Mayo;  I suppose you feel some objection to their being at different places, but I do not think it is much;  Isaac has got to be old enough to learn to depend upon himself, and experiences is the only efficient teacher, and till he does go out into the world he never will have the mental discipline & moral courage that are gained by depending upon one's own resources.  Almeda & I both think this course would be best, the School begins in a fortnight from next Mond., and he must get here for to be examined before that time, so he would need to come just as soon as it is possible for you to send him, without fixing him in the least, we can do that.  Charley may find it difficult to get the money and if I had it on hand, I feel so anxious to accomplish this, that I would send some in this letter but I can't now, he can get it I know at some rate or other, and if necessary, I will send it back to him.

I was unusually faithful in act visiting last month being the close of the year, I made calls upon above 40 families stopping a while to converse with most of them, I commonly carry tracts to only a bout 20 families because we go separately, ( Miss Mann & I,) but last month we went together which took almost all my spare time except evenings for three weeks.  (this month I carried them all in two hours, it was a new  year's tract to be left at the door only). I have been attending a course of free lectures to teachers every Wednes. several weeks, on different subjects connected with education, by different gentlemen which are instructive and interesting.  My health is, as usual perfectly good, my school is pretty full, I have several attending to drawing and painting which take my time out of school, but is more profitable, I sometimes feel almost weary of my school with its vexations, turmoils, responsibilities, and look back upon the winter I spent a Milo with my school in the \"fore room\" with something like regret that such happy easy days will probably never come again .  with some such feelings I suppose as all who have gone far enough on the journey of life to have its cares a \"reality\" look back upon by gone days.  How hard a lesson it is, to learn not to expect our happiness from this world, and place dependence on it;  but the sooner we learn this lesson I believe, the more happiness we shall enjoy; I have thought much of your expression, in the close of your letter, that the nearer we keep eternity in view, the happier we shall be, and I fully believe it, but we keep forgetting that we are but 'strangers and pilgrims' here, and keep looking round and trying to grasp at something in this world that we can depend upon for happiness.  The thought of growing old, and losing all the freshness of youth with the bright hope & sanguine anticipations of the 'morning of life' sometimes is painful to me, but at other times I can feel thankful that I have passed so many of the snares and temptations that beset us at this golden period.  The prevailing feeling of my mind is that of peace and contentment, I do not now look forward to any 'great things' but it is my desire to be satisfied and happy wherever, and with whatever my Heavenly Father shall appoint;  we are sure that 'all things shall work together for our good' if we are indeed his children, I can see that even my little disappointments, rebuffs, and discouragements, have been really for my good; and how unreasonable it is not to place full confidence in the faithfulness of our God & Saviour. \n[top of page upside down]\nI have not room to say any thing particularly to you all, but it is not because I do not think of all.

no doubt these promises are precious to you ,are, and have been, the source of rich consolation in all your trials.  With regard to Joseph must be thinking what is best for him to do\u00a0; I suppose, without doubt a place might be obtained in a store for him in the spring, in every respect eligible; but he would have to give his time and probably more for the first year;  James and others think some wholesale store would be best, and, in such, boys rarely receive more than a dollar a week which you know would not pay his board.  A few weeks ago there was a chance for him to go into a small Unitarian bookstore for 2$ per week but we thought not best for him to go there, so did Mr Bush & Whipple whose advice was asked.  Mr Whipple's partner wants an  apprentice to the printing business & he asked Joseph if he did not want that place, but James thinks that would be very poor business for him, so much is done by steam and girls.   If he should learn a trade his board and clothes would be provided;  James and others think that a wholesale store would give him a better knowledge of business and more opportunities of rising in the world, than any other store have the advantage he would enjoy here, make it desirable,  I think on any counts that he should stay rather than go back on to a farm, he will I hope become favorable known as a boy of religious principles, and intelligent mind, and from the influences he will meet with, he will be more likely to make a decided and useful Christian, here:  he has told his Sabbath School teacher that he hopes he is a christian, & if his future conduct and feelings show that he is truly a child of God, it would be highly important, that he should make a profession of religion as he would be less apt to be led away from the path of duty.  He does not express a great desire for staying here, though I believe it is rather his wish, but if it is not best for him to have a permanent stay and business here it is not best for him to go into any store, because he would get no wages at first.  Almeida's situation and family will be such new spring & summer that she cannot board him, and the expense besides what he can earn must be furnished somehow;--  if my school should be as good as it is now I could probably do it, but that is uncertain; you & C., must think it over and write very soon so that we can know what course to take; I am thinking some of finding another boarding place for Joseph & I especially if he does not stay longer than till spring;  it would be a great relief to A. on account of her health, and the additional expense would not be so great as the additional benefit to Joseph, to be in a good boarding house in (good society a little. \n[top of page] \nJoseph does not wear flannel but I have made him 4 very thick, large shirts; I have the use of the sewing & wish you had thought to send some pieces of his jacket, pants, so i am very sorry about his surtout it is so small that it looks badly on him as if made 2 or 3 years ago and out grown.

We have concluded to have Joseph W leave school, at the\nend of this week (i.e. the 16th) so that he can have a week or two\nto look round before going home.  I think we ought to be thankful\nthat he has had this opportunity;  it has furnished him with more of\njust the right kind of mental discipline and improvement, than we\nshould, very easily have found elsewhere.  As to his entering again next fall\nif he should, he would have to go over the same course that he has now \n? hole in paperhope he would not need then, I should think he had ought\n? to work for? hole in paper Charles this summer, and then work his way and get fitted\nfor college as well as he can, and as a way shall be opened for him.  He has\nbeen a good boy and acquitted himself well, but is in danger I fear of \ntoo much self satisfaction.  he ought to be one of the best scholars for\nhe is one of the oldest, and he ought to improve his time well for he has had\nmore opportunity of learning its value than most of our Boston boys.\nI feel much pleased that Isaac is making good progress in studies and think it important that he\nshould continue them;  I think he had better have the books he needs for with them, he\ncan, and will no doubt get along some, even without a teacher.  I wish he could go to Bangor\nto school, but his board would cost so much:  I have taken up 25 dolls of the 70, and shall\nhave to take more to fix Joseph off, and get I's books:  the rest (say 25 dolls) might I suppose\nbe taken for his board, - or we could send to Uncle Jacob, for enough to send him a quarter,\n& pay Almeda for J's board; if you and C think best he has as yet received nothing, and they are\nnot as I know of, in immediate want of it, but whether they could wait till you\ncould send it in honey, flour , it is doubtful.  Whatever the conclusion is, Isaac must\nhave books and I can get them at the antique bookstore at a lower rate than I have\ngenerally, at my bookstore, and if second hand, lower still, but you must write\nvery particularly, the names of authors and editions, and it will be necessary for you to\nanswer this, as quick as possible after receiving it, in order to have time before Joseph\nstarts, we intend to have him go the first trip after we hear from you.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94211,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94211","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/9df124dbfb18d314a7b6b88955398eb6.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/9df124dbfb18d314a7b6b88955398eb6.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/9df124dbfb18d314a7b6b88955398eb6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9df124dbfb18d314a7b6b88955398eb6.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:44:46+00:00","modified":"2020-10-17T07:13:42+00:00","filename":"9df124dbfb18d314a7b6b88955398eb6.jpg","authentication":"086a6160fe70ffd8e992b553efb305e4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_03_009_002_o2.jpg","size":1683712,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

I have 15 girls between the\nages of 7 and 16, and 21 boys from 8 to 13;  quite a formidable school I assure\nyou, requires more labour, and produces greater fatigue, than any school \nI was ever in, my daily duties are, 1st call to order at 9 o clock, 2 read\nover the names of scholars to ascertain who are absent or tardy:  3 prayers:  4th\neach scholar reads a verse in the testaments:  5th first diversion of reading:  6th second\ndo.  each of which spell from their readings lesson:   7th first division in grammar\nrecite and passe:- 8th second division ditto.  9th recess. 10th third division recite Colburn\n11the second division in Coblear:  12the 1st divisions in Smith's Arithmetic.  13th\nsecond in Smith's; that finishes the forenoon, which last till half past 12:  the afternoon\nis occupied in Geography which all studys and spelling, and the first class\nin Colburn:  attend to writing twice a week Wednes, and Sat.

Much is expected of teachers\nher and I have an usually difficult place to fill, for the former teacher has the\nreputation of being one of the very best there, was loved by all the scholars and\nyou know the very same teacher would not meet with half so good acceptance under\nsuch circumstances, I am only to fill her place till spring (one term) and there is no\nkind of probability that I can establish a character for any thing more than a \nvery ordinary teacher.  The situation I have here is, all things considered, as good\nas I have any reason to expect, and would be desirable, if I could only succeed in\npleasing the committee, the teachers here are thought enough of, and sufficiently\nnoticed, their pay gives them a good living, & the social and literary as well as religious \nprivileges', make it a desirable situation.  I feel as if my character and fortune\nsuccess depended much upon my being considered a good teacher by the committee whole","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94215,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94215","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/3b9540c5f010eb3c74c59444d0da4718.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/3b9540c5f010eb3c74c59444d0da4718.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/3b9540c5f010eb3c74c59444d0da4718.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3b9540c5f010eb3c74c59444d0da4718.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:44:52+00:00","modified":"2020-10-17T07:39:50+00:00","filename":"3b9540c5f010eb3c74c59444d0da4718.jpg","authentication":"472bef850bc2d4bfcd8ee48546459c8e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_03_010_002_o2.jpg","size":1698480,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2886,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.054492954492954},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180529"],"TimeCreated":["234812"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180529"],"TimeCreated":["234812"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180529"],"TimeCreated":["234812"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3b9540c5f010eb3c74c59444d0da4718.jpg","FileDateTime":1586648541,"FileSize":1698480,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2886\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2886,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:25:43","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:29 23:48:12","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:29 23:48:12","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"SubSecTimeOriginal":15,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3104,"ExifImageLength":3871,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1214,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1214","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I have very little expectation of being so; old Mrs Harlow & Miss Walker take a great deal of interest\nin my getting along well, and I am very happily situated as to boarding;\nThere is many valuable books to read, and we have some good times in singing\nand playing on the piano.  Mr. W is a real, lively, good natured, shrewd good sort of a man,\nMrs. W. really kind and agreeable, polite and intelligent, and Miss W real clever\nwhile Grand ma'am is really affectionate, and kind, spends her time partly \nhere and partly at her son's.  Isaac is treated as far as I can see, just like a boarder &\nhas a fine chance to learn, if he would only realize his advantage and improve\nthem:  what a favourable opportunity to gain the best of all knowledge, that of his\nmaker and redeemer but I fear he thinks little of his obligation or his own \nreal good.  I expect to take charge of a class in Sabbath school, next sabbath.  It\ndoes not seem much like Pine Street:  I have not been to an evening meeting yet\nbut mean to this week:  I have made me a comfortable hood, one of the drawed\nkind, like a calash but stuffed.  they are much worn here, the material cost $1,15.\nI have not money to buy any shoes; I don't like it that A. does not send some, but suppose\nshe thinks it of no consequence.  If I could be at home all day I could make you a \ngood hood. - Mr. Thomas came in last Wednes, brought me books &c, and \nsat some minutes, talking after his manner:  I thought afterwards that he\nwanted I should pay him, and I was sorry I didn't, for he ought I suppose\nto be paid and it belonged to me to pay him.  It is very hard times for money\nall about here, people are out of business talking of going out farms in the spring\nvery little business done, it is a pity Charles did not take a school unless he can\nfind profitable work on his farm.  How does Eliab get along?  I hope it will be\nshown that he has sufficient energy and resolution to overcome any little\nobstacles, such as indolence, that may lie in the way of his improvement, as\ndetermination to learn.  Have had four new boys one 16 years old\nhave furnished 7 boys with a great stout ferule and get along pretty well: I have\nto walk most half a mile up and down hills, schoolhouse is near the railroad bridge; my\nschool receives the older scholars of three other schools, and his pupils for the Select School\ntaught by Mr Littlefield, who prepares them for the High School.  I visited Mrs Mary Dougal\nlast week, where I took tea with 4 school teachers ( two of whom board there) and 4 of\nthe students, had a pleasant time, Isaac came in, after me:  he and I went to the\nLyceum last evening with Mr W's ticket, heard Gov. Kent , Ms Harlow says it will be good for I. to \nhave me here, says he\n\n I have purchased this afternoon some new ribbons, pair of shoes, pair of gloves and going to get a card of good steel pens\nwhich I am satisfied will be cheaper than to keep a supply of quill.  I will send the wool there.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94216,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94216","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/1e21f8fe42d7d85d8eac2ec92b7ba54a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/1e21f8fe42d7d85d8eac2ec92b7ba54a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/1e21f8fe42d7d85d8eac2ec92b7ba54a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1e21f8fe42d7d85d8eac2ec92b7ba54a.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:44:53+00:00","modified":"2020-10-17T07:43:54+00:00","filename":"1e21f8fe42d7d85d8eac2ec92b7ba54a.jpg","authentication":"970d81ce18ba0bc802d1be446a49e245","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_03_010_003_o2.jpg","size":1514704,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2860,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049038591038591},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180529"],"TimeCreated":["234816"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180529"],"TimeCreated":["234816"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180529"],"TimeCreated":["234816"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1e21f8fe42d7d85d8eac2ec92b7ba54a.jpg","FileDateTime":1586648541,"FileSize":1514704,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2860\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2860,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:25:45","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:29 23:48:16","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:29 23:48:16","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"SubSecTimeOriginal":2,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3071,"ExifImageLength":3865,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1214,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1214","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"My Dear Brother Eliab                       Dec. 39\nAs Ann wrote to Mother, I thought I would write\na few lines to you, just to fill up the sheet.\nI want that you should write to me, particularly, all about how you\nget' along, write a good long letter once in a while.  you can well\nenough, if you will only try.

I suppose you have pretty good sledding now.\nYou must be a good boy and try to study and learn as much as you can.\nDear Eliab\nI meant to have said more to you, while I was at home,\nupon the importance of forming, habit of early rising, now.\nWhile I was at home, I, somehow, laid abed so myself, that I could not very\nwell, preach about it!!!  However, it is a fact, that you sleep much\nmore than is for your good - Nothing is easier, than to get into such a\nhabit of sleeping more than is necessary, that you 'can't help it'\nyou may, sometimes, be in a situation, where you  will want all the time\nyou can get.  and a habit of of sleeping 2 or 3 hours more than you ought\nwill be very inconvenient to say the least.  I have sometimes thought I\nshould be willing to give a thousand dollars (if I had it,) if Mother had now\npermitted me to sleep more than about 6 hours per day, even if she had\nto whip me every day for it.  I do believe that it is all in habit on\nbringing up about the quantity of sleep required.  'Young ones' are in the way in\nthe evenings and are sent off to bed and I know, that they will not like to get up early.\nI don't believe that the way to have children get up early is to send them to bed early.\nI don't believe that any one, (properly educated), needs more than 6 hours sleep.\nThe difference between 6 or 8 hours sleep in 40 years is equivalent to the \naddition of 10 years to a

I have since received another letter from Joseph, which I will send\nwith this.  I do not like conduct in giving up his situation without hearing from you\nand wonder that Almeda should let him do it:  I wrote rather a scolding answer about\nbeing so wise, taking his concerns into his own hands without even consulting his mother\nand older friends; I sent it yesterday (i.e. your letter filled out, - I am glad you wrote what\nyou did I think it will have a good effect.  I suppose his sanguine feelings will be\nsomewhat damped:  probably he will have to stay after he has left the store, as I shall\nnot have any money to send him till  the first or middle of Apr, and ought not to\nspare much then, as what I shall have left after paying board, will be all I can have\ntill fall, and if I stay here I shall need to spend some before that time.  I wrote to them that\nLucy must not come with J. if you can have Olive, I should think she had better\nstay till fall.  As to Joseph I think it best for him to leave there if I could find a chance\nfor him to board and go to school here.  It seems to me it is his duty to study for the ministry,\nif he is truly, a child of God:  I fear he is far from feeling right, or having any\nadequate sense of what his duty is:  I have not seen a word from him or Almeda in relation\nto his joining the church:  if he were devoted pious I think it most likely, he\ncould succeed in finding a place here permanently while attending the Classical School.\nI have a plan in my head:  it is this, to ask Mr. N Harlow, who has a large farm\nto carry on, to take Isaac for his work, and there have J. come to Mrs. Walker's.\nIsaac perhaps could work for him for wages during the Aug vacation and so get some\nmoney to clothe himself for the winter then attend school the fall term and take\ntwo schools in the winter and were he only pious he might enter the C. School the\nensuing spring.  Joseph would have but little time to play at home before the summer\nterm commenced (about midday of Apr.) and would need to come from Boston\nas soon as he could conveniently.\n[upside down]I asked Mr. W. something about dividing the mill; he said if the property was such\nas could be divided: it could be done by petitioning the court next spring but the other party\ncould get it put off till fall. Perhaps C. could get the line divided without dividing the mill.\nIf he had gone off and learned the business last fall and winter according to my plan.\nI do'nt believe but it would have been better. Isaac studies well and they say gets along\nwell in his Latin and Greek but is apparently indifferently and more hardened than ever in\nrespect to the concerns of his soul. It seems as if now was the very time and perhaps the\nonly time yet he is careless. totally unconcerned.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94219,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94219","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/8e915811dcbc5ed9971d9fbfed7003f1.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/8e915811dcbc5ed9971d9fbfed7003f1.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/8e915811dcbc5ed9971d9fbfed7003f1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8e915811dcbc5ed9971d9fbfed7003f1.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:44:57+00:00","modified":"2020-10-17T20:33:43+00:00","filename":"8e915811dcbc5ed9971d9fbfed7003f1.jpg","authentication":"35a99b7bf7886c694196f7b50cc04068","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_04_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1734815,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2856,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.056243353823011},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180529"],"TimeCreated":["234854"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180529"],"TimeCreated":["234854"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180529"],"TimeCreated":["234854"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8e915811dcbc5ed9971d9fbfed7003f1.jpg","FileDateTime":1586648541,"FileSize":1734815,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2856\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2856,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:25:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:29 23:48:54","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:29 23:48:54","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2997,"ExifImageLength":3777,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1214,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1214","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I intend to ask Mr. Pomroy whether he wants a boy but I do not think it all probably\nthey have two girls; no hare or row, I believe; burns coal chiefly so he would not have much to do\nwent there from school, last monday, staid and went to meeting in the evening had a pleasant time\nthere is a great deal of attention to religion in all the churches:  I is very much engaged, has frequent\nand crowded meetings, many inquiries and quite a number entertain here.  I attend an\ninteresting Bible class every sat. afternoon taught by Mr. Dole a student in the seminary:  it is \non the book of Hebrews.  there is a very interesting state of feeling in the church.  a spirit of prayer\nand humility.  I have a class in Sabbath school of six or seven quite interesting girls.\nI get along pretty well with my school, had one great boy expelled, this week: have four\nweeks more to keep, don't know whether I shall stay longer or not.  I have not got acquainted\nmuch yet, don't go out much except to meeting, I spent an evening at Mr. Cutlers, intend\nto call upon Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Walker and I have commenced studying together, been\nclarified Moral Philosophy:  recite a lesson every evening to Mrs. Walkers.  She's a most\nlovely woman. - they talk of giving up housekeeping to have the house repaired but have\nnot concluded whether they shall or not:  his sister is going home soon, and Mrs. W\nis going to get a girl.

Had you not better write right off and direct him to come in a packet to Frankfort as soon\nas I send him some money, which I can do I suppose about the last of March.  In the meantime\nI will be trying to find a place for him here.  I spoke with Mrs. W about it, she seemed to think\nit doubtful whether I could find a place:  if she cannot find a place here it would seem to be much better for him to stay where\n[right-hand side] he is, till Isaac leaves, but it will all work out for the best some way.\n[upside down]Nov. 24th What weather, this season!; if we have 2 or 3 more rains\nit will do to go to ploughing! Is not Charles sorry he did not keep school this winter,\nas it has turned out? I am sure he can't do much with his team, any way.\nYou must write good long letter, and tell me what to do.

Feb 22d 1840\n\nDear Mother\nMr. R. Cutts called here yesterday noon, and left\na bundle from Milo, but our letters were not ready to send by him.\nWhy don't you write a good long whole letter, instead of a little bit on\na wee scrap of paper?  And Eliab did not write a bit this time.  he ought\nto.  It would be a great advantage to him; much greater than he is aware of, or\nanybody else, I am afraid.  It would assist him both in learning to write\nand to compose.  The pantaloons sit well, I guess, much better than the \nother ones, they are rather long, both ways, I guess, but I think set well, I have\nonly tried them on.  I believe we have been rather negligent, along back, about\nwriting home, but.- Ann's time is pretty well used up, in her school and\nmeetings almost every evening, in the week:  and I have to be very busy with my lessons\nboth in school and out.  I study now both in the Greek Reader and Testament,\nrecite in 2 different classes, poetry.  get along pretty well in both and in Cicero &c\nI study hardly any thing now much, but Latin and Greek (besides Component ?)\nI am the best 'Greek scholar' in my class, I guess; and most about equal to any in\nLatin, although in that class not had as good a chance as the others. \nI perceive by your letter that Eliab still persists in his foolish whim of calling\nthe Whitefaced Cow or heifer \"Cherry\"!  he ought to be ashamed of himself.\nWe sent the letter to Joseph last Wed. the 19th but it contained nothing but scolding;\nAnn was very much provoked by his letter, (which we shall send) and wrote very severely, too\nmuch so I think.  Whatever fault there is, I think it is more James and Almeda than him.\nI certainly think he had better come home, and - circumstances after cases.\nSomehow neither you nor Eliah seem to write any particulars hardly about affairs.\nI want to know all how everything gets along, at home nowadays.\nI thought Charles petitioned to have the will divided last year\nsometime, why didn't he?

I have begun to fearer still more lately, not hearing any report from any of you.  I thought Lucy would be down before now.  \nJames F. Walker arrived home last Friday night.  May day, from Hancock, on Sullivan rather.  He has been teaching ever since, Monday after Thanksgiving.  They are going to work upon the house soon, will move the barn, tear down the old kitchen washroom and shed, make new chimneys and fix up the back part of the house room.  The work in the garden is also coming on in a great hurry, on account of the rainy weather lately we have not done much only fix the Front Yard and Set out Yews &c.

I have begun to study French this term, but shall lack time I fear.  The rest of the class, even Roberts, study nothing but Latin and Greek, except perhaps History or so.  Moreover I set side of Roberts and commonly get my lessons with him.  He only studies Latin and Greek.  I certainly cannot get my lessons, much quicker than he can, and soon.  \nMr. Walker wants to buy a cow before a great while; wants, he says, a very young and very good one; will pay money cash I suppose.

of milk in about a month or so, and drive it down here, I will stuff up Mr. Walker and tell him how they are not very great but good and would be more profitable that a very great one that would give no more milk etc.etc.etc.\nThe Butter is all sold and I have the money. about $5.00 small box 14 1\/4 lbs. at 1 b per lb,$1,71 the larger 21 1\/2 lbs (5 1\/2 pound box weight) at 15 per lb= $3.221\/2

She will get along very well for clothes,\nmy small figured muslin fits her exactly and is long enough and will make her a good school\ndress.  I have spent $1,03 upon her bonnet, had it bleached and pressed and altered a little making\nit under at the ears and larger in the crown, trimmed with light green ribbon and cape\nbehind, and it is an elegant looking bonnet, the trimming will be suitable for next winter\ntoo.

Tues. eve.Nov. 2   I should think Isaac would be more likely to get a school and more likely to keep it prosperously if he should go to school a few weeks first.  If he intends to persevere, and go through his studies it seems highly important that he should review his Latin & Greek and get started so as to be able to pursue it this winter while teaching.  as to a surtout I should think he might borrow C's till he could have one made, and C. use the cloak in which he always looks well.  the money here is on two bills, one of 18 and the other of 30.  The 18 will be enough to pay six weeks for I and J.  the 30 remain for Eliab when his time comes, Had I better get the 18 soon?\nI have 70 scholars now and some provoking ones though the school in general is as pleasant as usual;  i get more fatigued in body and mind than last summer or at least the school seems more tedious to me, I have half a mind to take a vacation of next term getting some one to supply my place and so return to it again next winter, but there would be some disadvantages in that, yet I do really need a longer resting than the short vacations afford. and it would be as profitable supposing I should take a school of ten or twelve weeks in the course of the summer, for what I earned I could have;  here it takes just half my earnings to pay my board, and the other half is less than enough to get what the fashion, customs or even decency requires.\nAs to the long night gowns I wonder we had not thought of them before, they are so necessary for sickness in the winter.  If C. can furnish me with some money for it I will get and make up some, for I have time evenings, which I have spent almost altogether in Mrs. Walker's room he read aloud and commonly makes rather a long evening  He is now reading \"A new home or who\"ll follow\" by Mrs. Clavers a fashionable & first rate Broadway lady whose husband became proprietor of a town in Michigan and went from the city of New York to reside there, She accommodated herself to all the hardships and inconveniences of her new home to which she carried six small children, and her book is full of common sense and useful hints and interesting sketches.  He has been reading memories in five large volumes of Sully ,  a book written about 250 years in the time of Henry 4th of France  it is as interesting as a novel, is filled with just and discriminating ideas of human affairs, shows a great knowledge of human nature and is a strictly authentic account of a truly great man. as well as all the affairs of France and other nations at that time & an impartial view of it. Mr. W. has also read aloud one of Jame's historical novel Richlieu so you see I read and work too; I am likely to live very retired scarcely ever going out, and seldom seeing any company here but so

have just had that call from Ellen Lee, she told me that Isaac had\nabout given up going to Foxcroft:-  I am afraid it is not a good conclusion if he can\nsucceed in getting schools and get a parcel of money to spend next spring at school it\nmight be better than to go this fall, if he could earn money enough this winter\nto go three month next spring, and then earn enough next summer on\nMr. Lee's farm or somewhere else, to go three month next fall; he might\nbe getting long some in his studies.  If he does not go to school this fall; he might\nbe getting along some in his studies.  If he does not go to school this fall I should\nthink his plan of going down east where J. Walker kept, was a good one, or\nelse among the island down this river, or in the provinces where schools\nare generally poor -\nMrs. Rogers has engaged three new boarders-daughters of\nDr. Bartlett - the eldest a young lady who gives construction on the\npiano, at her own room, by which she earns 80 dolls per quarter-the\ntwo younger are misses attending school - they have a parlour\nand sleeping room, and pay six dollars one of them will\nlodge with me, - then attend the invitation meeting -\nMr: W has nearly made up his mind to removed to Monroe\na village 16 miles from here on the road to Belfast and\n8 from the Cutler place - he has flattering prospects there of a good\nstand for business and the probability in, - they will remove there\nin the course of the winter, and I shall find a boarding place near\nmy school, it would save my clothes and perhaps my health\nand I might be more pleasantly situated too.  If I do change,\nmarried couples his wife was Julia Godfrey.  They live in the same\nhouse that Mr. Cutler did, only they occupy Mrs. Chase's\npart too, his mother lives with them.  That would be in every\nrespect ineligible place.  If they will take me, in that ear I wd\ngo into a company much more than now, shall need a new dress\nfor which purpose I shall want to use two or three of the 18 when I get it\nwhich I will replace when I can so etc. -my weeks vacation comes about\nthe third week on Dec a fortnight after thanksgiving and if it should be good sleighing there\nand if it should be convenient then I should like very much to go home.  I could dismiss my sch\nthe Friday eve, here being and start Sat. and return the next Sat. but we can see about it when\nthe time comes.  Lucy will relate a few particulars of the school for your special use, in spite of my fixed \nresolution to have no more scholars, than one to each desk, - I had a class of seven sent in from Miss\nThurston's so far as valued that I could not well refuse to take them - one of them is named\nBridget Mulligan a beautiful cognoman which the few first times it was called over , unavoidably\nbrought a smile and stare into the faces of the scholars. _ I have divided my scholars into smaller\nclasses this term and I like the arrangement.  I have 4 classes in each different study and they recite\nstanding on the platform in front of the tablet while I stand at the back side of the room\nanother great improvement has been made on each side wall now, the roots\nare screwed down to the floor - chairs are on the back side and in the middle, and\nthe two inner rows have the recitation seats five on each side, raised higher and nailed\nto the floor:  this saves the noise of moving stools, which you know was a good annoyance.\nI have frequent applications to take scholars, but I refuse all except my old scholars, C.Woodman\nattend now. - Elizabeth Palmer is to build the fire all winter in consideration of a new Geog. study\nwhich I got for her, from the committee:  I have only one kind of Geography in school.

You will wonder what I do with my long \"evenings\", and I will\nendeavor to show you how I am as positively engaged then as in the day\nwell, Mr. Walker has constantly taken books from the Library, - interesting ones too,\nto read aloud, he and I alternately, he the beginning of the evening, and I the\nlatter part, with my knitting in hand, now if I spend an evening in any other\nway I lose part of the story, moral or whatever. I enjoy these evenings so much\nthat I have become quite a recluse in respect to society, having been out but two\nevening since my return, both upon particular invitations. At one of the places\nI met with W. Dennett, the other time I visited Caroline Prescott's mother, she\nis a grand good scholar this term. Mond. eve, I received your letter and one from\nJo at the same time and was very glad of them. I pity poor Jo. I am much\nconcerned for fear that he will fail. I have been thinking of writing, and\ndo mean to though I am some afraid I shan't get it there before he gets\nthrough. I want to give him some advice but suppose he has plenty.\n\nI feel greatly relieved that C. has settled with Wyman even if not to the best\n\nadvantage. I hope Isaac will get the other school for a little more needful, will be\nvery convenient, and there never was a scarcer time for money it is said to be\nthe same at New York and Boston, as here. I have got none yet -- have literally\nbeen without a farthing since I spent the .25 that Lucy gave to get thread on my\nonly gloves are a pair that I carried from home - too small for you -- for school\ngloves. I have really become very economical - query- do I deserve credit for it?\nMr. W. has tried to take up the order without success but thinks I can have it before\nlong now, my board money has been wanted and wanted, without my being\nable to pay, so that I could not have changed my lodgings  if I had wished\nMr. and Mrs. W. have concluded to stay here till their year is out, when they will either\ngo out of town or change boarding place. - I feel rather undecided what course\nto take. If I write that I will go to Houleton, if they want me, I do'nt know but I\nshall be obliged to give up my chance here, upon uncertainties, for, it is not\nat all probable that I can ascertain what the chance would be at Houleton\nbefore then to commence here, so that if I engage to go there upon a certain\ncompensation, I should have to give up the chance here whether I had that or not\nsometimes I get so wearied with my never ceasing 'schooling', of my flirting &\ngiddy, restive and not very limited flock, that I think I do'nt care a fig, if\nI do give up the chance: there are many agreables in living here which I\ncould not have in keeping school from place to place but perhaps content balanced\nby greater freedom from harassing and unquieting cares in the country. I have heard an\nopinion partly expressed by Mr. Walter and Wakefield talking together that the \ncity would not support two Schools in some sense high, taught by males much longer, and\nand perhaps a school something like Mr. Littlefield's might be taught by a female\nwhich would save much expense, but supposing this, whether I could get along even if\nI wanted, it would be a question.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94235,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94235","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/460705bd259ebb831c75c1525c81f3c2.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/460705bd259ebb831c75c1525c81f3c2.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/460705bd259ebb831c75c1525c81f3c2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/460705bd259ebb831c75c1525c81f3c2.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:45:20+00:00","modified":"2020-07-27T11:00:21+00:00","filename":"460705bd259ebb831c75c1525c81f3c2.jpg","authentication":"4dd7b28464fabf649f12f17c0be10d03","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_04_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1987000,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

of three weeks ago, his highness Mr. Littlefield conceived it his duty to leave his own\nspecial charge, and visit my humble scene of labours, he came in, a quarter before eleven\nat my request heard a class passe, then during the space of an hours by my watch, he \nlectured my scholars, using great plainness of speech' reminding them of all their\nmisdoings both actual and possible, telling them over and over, what they must do in\norder to get into Mr. Littlefields' school, inviting them to come in, a class at a time,\ninto his school, to see how orderly, studious, still and well arranged it was; my\nscholars were very still, and perfectly attentive, though his speech was so long; when\nhe returned to his own school he told them he had been absent so long because\nhe was needed more than with them, that he found my scholars behaving rather\nbadly, so he stayed to talk to them; this I heard from Mary Bartlett our boarder\nand his scholar 16 years old; she said his school carried on, bad enough while he\nwas gone Lorraine M. getting into the desk and mimicking him &c.  I can't conceive\nwhy he should say so, and to his scholars too, except his notorious habit and policy of\ncarrying it in the light to his scholars, that their school is considerably better in\nevery respect than any other.  I thought his conduct almost an imposition - Mr.\nWalker laughed about it said he should like to quiz him a little in the paper, for leaving\nhis own school to inspect and lecture others, proposing his own as a model. -\nHe teaches a class in French this term though it is not according to the wishes of\nthe committee to have any but common branches taught there, he addresses his class\non all occasions as Mademoiselle this, or that - bah!\nTues 1st - I will relate a little school occurrence for Lucy's gratification, last\nFriday night I kept Susan Bounds after school to talk to her for disorderly\nconduct after reasoning, threatening &c.  I dismissed her, - in going\nout, she muttered something which I did not hear, I called her back, but\nshe marched straight on, I sent a girl to speak to her to come back, she\nsaid she did not care what Miss Rich said, and went on; - the next\nmorning I called her up in order to punish her when she said, 'Mother\ntold me if you ferruled me, to bring your books home', I told her to take\nher books home and not come anymore, and wrote a note to her\nMother that I should consider her no longer member of the school,\nwhich I sent by another girl; Mond, morn Susan came again accompanied \nby her grown up sister who said she was sorry Susan had behaved so\nbad and wanted me to take her again;  I told her that if her Mother\nreally sent the word that was brought me I should decline receiving her\nagain for that I considered myself the proper judge whether one of my scholars\ndeserves punishment, and that her mother had chosen such a want of competence\nin me that I though she would be better satisfied to send her to some other\nschool, she rather disclaimed her mother of having sent me the word, and urged me

all the folks whom it may concern,                                           Foxcroft Aug 24th 1843\nAlmeda I have thought considerable about your Lucy's state of health since I came from there and\nI wonder you don't all of you feel more the importance of doing something about it.  It would be no sleight\nevil to have her a poor, sickly, deformed, humpbacked invalid all her days situated as you are, you will very\nmuch  need the efficient help of an eldest daughter:  I take it the best remedy is a great deal of free, healthy physical\nexercise, accompanied by a pleased interested state of mind.  I would have her today with other children as\nmuch as practicable, and ride whenever convenient, and especially learn to jump the rope, which  you know\nexercises the shoulders and expands the chest.  I should think if James comes up here with his wool, he might as he has\nnot a large quantity, take in both the children of a Saturday morning early, and carry me back with  them\n(have a cricket in, the wagons) then Lucy or Eliab could come back with me Mond. morn and they would either of them\nin my opinion do the more work in a week.  It seems to me that all of you are too much absorbed with\nthe corroding and contracting rest of anxiety to gain the means of living and do not think enough ever for her pecuniary\nillness, - of the embellishments and enjoyments of life, since occasional relaxation.  How rarely is there anything\namong you to call forth the pleasurable emotions of gratitude to God in the enjoyment of this passing\nlife, or of kindly feelings of enjoyments in each other, to counteract the many rough, grating, disconsolant feelings\nthat are daily brought into excuse whose effect is, to blunt the finer feeling of the soul, and produce sordid selfishness.\nA want of interest in, and communication with others around is, it seems to me, a prominent fault in us as a family,\nand has had it, legitimate effect upon our own interests and circumstances, as well as upon our minds and characters!\nWe are looked upon rather with suspicion than interest by others, and lose how many opportunities of gaining advantages.\nHow differently should I have been situated now, in all business probability had I improved all the opportunities I\nhave slighted of gaining benefits.  The bump of caution is too largely developed in all of us from oldest to youngest, we\ncannot run any risk, or take any step out of the common course, for fear of something, we know not what; I expect\nJoseph's excellent plan of going up the Arostook and taking a school there will fail him want of courage\nor from being too late about it:  young Carpenter has lately, returned from Dennisfield Washington\nCo, where he has been teaching nine months at 25 dollars per month;  I heard him say that they\nwanted him again, but he was not going: perhaps if Isaac had courage enough to take the necessary\npains he might get such an opportunity, they have a school fund and do not employ female teachers.\nHad you not better fix Eliab out to commence the term, and let him have one whole quarters schooling\nat once, which he has never yet had, anywhere, and study Algebra and Surveying.  If Joseph could make\nhimself thoroughly acquainted with surveying and go up to Aroostook he might perhaps do well.   I have not\nsaid anything about this school for I and I suspect there will be two or three applicants here, I wish Charles\ninstead of painting his house, would lay out the money in preparing to go to housekeeping, get two rooms done\nmarry Lucy Hale, or some other clever girl before thanksgiving, and live there this winter all alone with his\nwife, while he is finishing off the rent, and let the painting go till another year.\nAnd now to the business part of my letter which is to propose for the consideration of all of you,\na plan which popped into my head a day or two since, and has rested there ever since, Miss Cavenne\nthe famous new teacher, will have six or eight scholars in music:  she has a piano, and will board next house\nto me where she has a room to receive her music scholars separate from the school, or school hours,\nat $5,00 each ear quarter.  Now I could probably take lessons of her at most any hour I should choose,\nand by paying a trifle more, could practise upon her piano and should be here four weeks without any\nexpense of board then by staying three or four weeks longer, I could take the quarter's lessons (24) practising\nmost all the time when my school was finished, and with an expense not exceeding $.10 could get a \nquarters instruction which is the common price of tuition only:  then if I could procure Mrs. Wilder's instrument\nfrom Williamsburgh at a reasonable hire, I could practise and practise all the next long\nwinter:  the music would be expensive, if I had it to buy, but I could undoubtedly borrow a music\nbook of Mr. Walker, that would answer every purpose and my Kingsley's choir too, is set to the piano.\nNow it would have been better for me to have spent two hundred dollars few years ago to learn it, but though I have\nhad several good chances to learn music during that time, I have had none to do it with so little expense, or when I had\nso much time to practise which is I suppose the greatest part:  it is true, beginning so late would be a great disadvantage,\nbut it is frequently &c, Miss Eliis teacher of Bluehill academy older than I am, boarded at Mis. Sylvesters, last summer\nand took lessons on purpose to teach it, and I suppose if one is a correct player, they can teach without being very\naccomplished at it, besides with pains and perseverance, I might make considerable proficiency, and I might take a\nschool next winter or the one Lydia Ann is keeping, perhaps and then if we go west I might stop at Lowell a while and\nperfect myself under Isaac Metcalfs tuition, or of some first rate man in Boston, enough for a name, and then I think\nthat either north, south, east or west, I could find a situation to get my living better than to take any chance at common\nschools with all the little country girls about here; where the more ignorant and poorer teacher is likely to be prefered.\nI spend four months of faithful laborious toil, and gains $.24 Miss C. in three months easy, and honourable living\nreceived more than twice that sum, I have spent considerable time and expense to get fitted to redo\nand have laboured faithfully almost seven years, and it seems as if I ought to be able to be something better than a \nmere \"tyrant of childhood!!\"  If I could in any other way than teaching, gain a comfortable living I would gladly give\nup 'the struggle on the arena of public life' and according to Isaacs idea settle down in 'quiet,' but I have not any near friend\nwho could afford to give me a living for all I could do for them, to say nothing of laying by for old age.-  Now I want\nyou all to take this subject into consideration, and help me determine whether I had best make the effort,\nthe very first step would be to ascertain whether I could obtain an instrument from Williamsburgh, as if I could\nnot the plan of course would fail:  Lucy might go to Ellen's and get her to go up to Williabh with her, and engage it, if it is best\nto do it; Dr Snow's daughters are going to learn, and if their father is not able to purchase a piano she would perhaps\ntry to get Mrs. Wilder's.  Now it seems to me that if I could take a quarters, lessons, and have the use of a \nmans for $.20 it would be worth while to do it; but must be decided soon, as the school begins in the\nfortnight after this week and before I could make any bargain with Miss Cavenne it would be necessary\nto know that I could have a piano to practise upon, after I got home, as without that, it would\ndo not good to take the lessons.  The more I think of the plan, the more it seems to me worth\nwhile to do it, if I can get a piano, and if I do any thing about that must decide the\nquestion.

I arrived at Bangor,\nTues. eve March 19th - staid at Mr. Pomroy's a little more than a \nweek - enjoyed myself much, came up with Mr. Cutts last Thurs.\nI found the schools in Bangor, begun when I got there, so I said\nnothing about it nor told any one that I thought any of taking one\nthis spring - Mr. Walker and Wakefield are on the new committee chosen\nafter I got there.  I found Charles keeping house all alone and getting\nalong very well:  Lucy had been gone four weeks I suppose they have\nwritten you from Foxcroft, so you know more about them than I do,\nI had a comfortable passage, only I was very sea-sick and have\nhardly got over it yet.  It cost me six dolls, and half to get to Bangor,\nto get to Milo $8,50 including all expenses, If I had known about the\nschools, and how comfortably Charles was getting along, I would have staid\ntwo or three weeks longer in Boston.  I hope you will not be in a hurry\nto start, but stay till the 1st of May, at least, for it will be less expensive\nthen, and the travelling will be very bad till about that time.  I wish you\nwould buy and bring a parcel of palm leaves really split, for I am\nconvinced we could make something by braiding them to sell them one\nat a time round here.  Almeda sent a letter to me while I was\non the way home, sending for some things, which of course will be\nin Boston &c. but which you had better not take out, but let it go\non to Washington as there is nothing of any consequence in it,\nAlmeda can send her directions in this;\nWhen you first get to Boston we want you should fix\nupon a time to start for down east, - you can see by the papers\nthe days the steamboat runs, and write to us when you are\ngoing to start, and Charles will be at Bangor - he wants to\ngo down when it comes good wheeling, - if you write some\nto get any thing we think of, - either in Boston or Bangor.\nMrs. Child when she learned my loss, presented me with $5,00\nwhich was very kind of her.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94243,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94243","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/cb28ee75187f16b09b572a812788578b.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/cb28ee75187f16b09b572a812788578b.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/cb28ee75187f16b09b572a812788578b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cb28ee75187f16b09b572a812788578b.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:45:32+00:00","modified":"2020-10-18T03:39:06+00:00","filename":"cb28ee75187f16b09b572a812788578b.jpg","authentication":"51a5345d52ca31826c44d1f29257d5f2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_04_007_002_o2.jpg","size":1438270,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

Your worrying about Joseph, we all conclude to be the consequence of your working too hard: but it seems to me you are more prone to indulge anxieties & harbour foreboding fears than you used to be;  I entreat and beseech you not to feel anxious and troubled, about any of us, it is certainly the safest and happiest as well as the right way, to trust.\n\nJoseph is well & prosperous, has considerable leisure, is I believe reading or studying law alone of course.  Eliab is well, lively and happy, He had a present from Frank, of an elegant four bladed knife, for Christmas.  \n\nLucy likes her boarding place, says they are as clever as 'ten thousand kernels of corn.' I guess they like her well.  Mrs. T. I suspect finds her superiour in every respect to what she expected:  he us quite well off; they have never kept much society, but now wish to make some display:  she has just had a velvet short cloak, that cost $30; a silk dress at $.24; & a new thibet dress besides:  Lucy has had sewing to do for Joseph which has taken up most of her time in school: she spends neatly an hour each half

The floor is covered with a new, gay colored rag-carpet, a table nearly square, stands under the glass, on which one arrayed several elegant books, workbooks, daguerreotypes, book of pictures like Lucy's Harper's Magazine, my nice bible, all looking quite 'recherche' on the blue and orange table cover - on one side a little stand, exactly on the centre of it a white vase containing flowers, above it some small bookshelves hung up with green cord. I got them made for our convenience, for the sum of .37 1\/2. On the other side of the room stand two large trunks which with four chairs, complete the furniture of the apartment. Next Sat. Miss Woodbury and myself talk of stuffing and neatly covering a glass box for a seat or cricket. Our windows have bright blue paper curtains next the glass, over them long white, fringed curtains. For these accommodations I pay the same at is Mr. Rumsey's $1.75 without washing, which I hire at .18 per week: - besides we are to find ourselves light and fuel, making the cost of board something more than 2.00 per week. I call in at Mr Rumsey's almost every day still sit within their pew, believe them to be real friends. Argyle is comfortable, is out riding every day, means to start for New Jersey on business in two or three weeks - still coughs some but is improved.

I was quite surprised to learn you were at Milo again: no doubt it will be a great comfort to Charles to know you are there but you could be so much more comfortable & in many respects so much more happy at Bangor during the cold weather that I felt really sorry to have you go back. The only satisfaction is that you are doing more good: are more needed at Milo. We have already planned to have you accompany us home when we go, to stay as long as you wish, there would be no difficulty in returning any time that you desired. somebody is going east every month, so if you become homesick or discontented you would not be obliged to stay. I have just written to Lucy her last to me was dated Feb. 21st. I am hoping every day to hear from Nettie to know when she thinks of coming here. I fear her health is much poorer than the tenor of their letters.\n\n[left-hand side, top and right-hand side] My love to Jamie tell him to set his aim high & in every thing he has to do do it as well as he can: then he will make a man let him remember, that, as is the boy so will be the man; I feel much interest in him:-- much desire he should make a good man, a superior man as he can do & ought to do above all that he be truly good that he should seek & obtain the blessing of God without which he shall be poor indeed.

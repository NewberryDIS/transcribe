She takes care of me night and day, after getting up these unclear nights to keep up my fire; remember, I do not call her up, but she does it of her own accord. I am sure she could not do more for me if she were my own sister.

She walks out every day with either husband or nurse and comes back as quietly as any one. You ask if I am able to keep warm now?

Remember me Sarah in your prayers and I will also often think of you when pleading for mercies for the sake of our Savior.\nYours in a dearer bond of love of God. name","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":32101,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/32101","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/3326ec7cce5b74a8df9fcd28e5204c4b.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/3326ec7cce5b74a8df9fcd28e5204c4b.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/3326ec7cce5b74a8df9fcd28e5204c4b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3326ec7cce5b74a8df9fcd28e5204c4b.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-09T19:18:23+00:00","modified":"2020-04-24T23:43:30+00:00","filename":"3326ec7cce5b74a8df9fcd28e5204c4b.jpg","authentication":"41521da97e580e34172411515ba5dad0","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_08_fl_329_001_02_o2.jpg","size":1220415,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2783,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040604164171358},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160223"],"TimeCreated":["044737"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160223"],"DigitalCreationTime":["044737"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160223"],"TimeCreated":["044737"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160223"],"DigitalCreationTime":["044737"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160223"],"TimeCreated":["044737"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160223"],"DigitalCreationTime":["044737"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3326ec7cce5b74a8df9fcd28e5204c4b.jpg","FileDateTime":1507576253,"FileSize":1220415,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2783\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2783,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:06:24 11:03:57","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:23 04:47:37","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:23 04:47:37","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":135,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/135","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"with God's help, and last Sabbath I was baptized and joined the church here which is under Mr. Carey's pastoral care.

I have nothing very interesting to say excepting that I am getting better; which I think, is as interesting as any thing I could have to say. But to prove that I am better I will just tell you what I have been doing. You remember sometime ago I mentioned that I was making a cord basket, I have got that almost finished, it is all done but one little wreath that I am going to mark on the bottom. It is going to be a smart pretty little thing when I get it done, but it is a great deal of work to make it, a good deal for me I mean. I have done something else, besides; I have knit a providence? cap for Ann, my dear nurse. She is so good to me, is kind and tender in everything, that it made me very happy to be able to do, even so little a thing for her. She takes care of me night and day, after getting up these cold nights to keep up my fire; remember, I do not call her up, but she does it of her own accord. I am sure she could not do more for me if she were my own sister. Six months yesterday I left my own dear home then? the sorrow had just disappeared, and now it has just returned; the gay, beautiful days of summer have intervened, the flowers have bloomed and faded, and useful Nature has once more taken up her rich green carpet, which she had then just spread and which was fast unclear down with the golden flowers of early spring, and has prepared herself for the rough wilds of winter, all this has passed, all these strange but beautiful changes","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":31958,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/31958","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/6f9ac0b120acb1621de638dd67f9108d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/6f9ac0b120acb1621de638dd67f9108d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/6f9ac0b120acb1621de638dd67f9108d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6f9ac0b120acb1621de638dd67f9108d.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-09T19:12:20+00:00","modified":"2021-01-27T15:28:10+00:00","filename":"6f9ac0b120acb1621de638dd67f9108d.jpg","authentication":"98f7244f42bdb1dd9a4161445cae2fa3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_08_fl_325_001_02_o2.jpg","size":1185310,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2839,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.03865830430642},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160223"],"TimeCreated":["042203"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160223"],"TimeCreated":["042203"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160223"],"TimeCreated":["042203"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6f9ac0b120acb1621de638dd67f9108d.jpg","FileDateTime":1507576248,"FileSize":1185310,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2839\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2839,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:02:24 14:37:02","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:23 04:22:03","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:23 04:22:03","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":95,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2464,"ExifImageLength":3124,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":135,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/135","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"have taken place, and still I am here.

She walks out every day with either husband or nurse and comes back as quietly as any one. You ask if I am able to keep warm now Thanks to you for this good warm shawl you left with me, for without it, I fear I should have been obliged to to answer no, but with it I have have kept very comfortable indeed.

The blue one in particular, looks quite bad. You said, when you wrote, that you did not get me any in Utica, and I have thought since, that perhaps I had better have a calico sack, not such as I wear now, but a short one something like my pink one, and a loose skirt to wear with it, as I spoke of when you were here.

But those sweet hours are gone, gone forever.    It is now quite late in the afternoon, perhaps you would be interested to know what I have been doing since I bade you good morning, this has been quite an eventful day to me and one that will be long remembered. I was carried to Miss Seymour's room this morning; it was the first time that I have been taken out of this room, only when I was taken out to be moved up stairs. I have seen more of the home today than I ever did before. Oh, it does seem so good to be able to be taken around a little. I do not feel very tired after it, but I will be better able to tell in the morning whether it was too much for me, or not. \nWed. 11?\u2014 I have not felt quite as well today as yesterday.

It seemed as if it would be almost useless to try when I first thought of it, but I succeeded finely?, as you will see. I commenced at Ann when she was giving me my morning bath; I coaxed and teazed her awhile and at last she consented, and went and asked Mrs. Kellogg.

July 12th 1854\n\nMy dearest Sarah\n\n     Doubtless you have expected a letter from me long before now, but you were dissapointed, were'nt you?   My thoughts have not been in Oregon, but they have been centered upon my unworthy self, and that too, not without some little effect, or rather some great effect, for it led me to a firm conviction of my great duty to myself and my fellow mortals.   And I have reason to thank my God that I have resolutely performed it, as far as it has been shown to me.\n        How much happier we are when we feel that we are doing our reasonable servise to our God and our Savior.    You knew what my views upon religion were, that is, you knew that I considered it our chiefest happiness and our greatest delight to obey all of our makers commands, but my fears were that I was not fully prepared to unite with his visible church here upon the earth.      I thought long and seriously and at length decided to come forth from the world and openly to show my love to Christ by uniting with his church.      I was rather hard for me all alone, among entire strangers to declare my wishes, but I did it\n\nalong the side and top:\nAll are usually well and send their best love to you.\nNow, my dear Sarah i hope that you have read this letter through quite as calmly as I wrote it, for if it should excite you or make you worse I should be exceedingly sorry.\nI should not have written it at present, but I knew that it could not be totally surprising and unexpected to you, and I wanted dear heart to feel happy with me, for I know that you have thought of me and my indecision with sorrow and some doubt.\nYou need not confess it, for I know that I should have doubted some had I been in you case, but now I can give you occasion to rejoice in the Lord. Remember me Sarah in your prayers and I will also often think of you when pleading for mercies for the sake of our Savior.\nYours in a dearer bond of love of God.

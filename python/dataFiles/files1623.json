Last year, for example, one of the local free papers which records some Alaska history, mentioned Dr. Cook's climb to Mt. McKinley disparagingly and now this year she has written an article in rebuttal.  Her health was bad last year but she is now fully recovered.  She asked what I remembered about the publication of Return from the Pole.  Jack got the manuscript from Eileen O'Connor and Pelligrini and Cudahy published it and he visited Helene in Buffalo but that's about all I remember.  Do you recall anything more?

Box 8114  Anchorage, Alas  99508   \nMarch 6, 1975\nDear Jack -\n\n      Got a letter today from Gene Nelson and learned of your forthcoming autobiography, I should say, already published, autobiography.  Gene flatters me by saying I should review it.  I think he'd do a much better job, faster, more workmanlike and very simpatico.  So by all means have your publisher send him a review copy.  I'm bogged down in a work syndrome for the next three years until I can join my retired friends.  I'm dropping out as soon as the system says I can collect.\n    I recall that in our exchange of Christmas greetings you were surprised there was a University in Anchorage.  There are two.  The University of Alaska here is a junior, senior and community college and the big squak [sic] among the teachers is that the administration in Fairbanks controls the strings and calls the financial tune, so that instructors were getting a better deal in Fairbanks.   Living costs are now approximately the same in both cities.  The state has money.  I mention this because I felt you might be thinking about lecturing here.  If you were I might be able to make some inquiries although I have no \"influence\" as such.  The instructor who taught the history course I took in the fall left for Bordeaux to study there for nine months.  However, the head of the A.CC. branch of the teachers union is a member of the English Dept.  Her name is Edie Lynch.  The other college is AMU, funded by Atlantic Richfield money and the Methodists.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":142987,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/142987","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/9c20ecf5fd8fb28412dd2d4b1b118003.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/9c20ecf5fd8fb28412dd2d4b1b118003.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/9c20ecf5fd8fb28412dd2d4b1b118003.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9c20ecf5fd8fb28412dd2d4b1b118003.jpg"},"added":"2023-04-04T19:21:37+00:00","modified":"2023-05-07T04:23:09+00:00","filename":"9c20ecf5fd8fb28412dd2d4b1b118003.jpg","authentication":"92f46a6e41d700b38f8ef8e3b2d6edc4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"992006198805867_midwest_ms_conroy_box_00027_fl_01411_000013.jpg","size":120663,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":796,"resolution_y":1200,"compression_ratio":0.04210741206030151062567057351770927198231220245361328125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00027], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00027], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00027], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1623,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1623","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Fred Thompson wrote a few weeks ago and mentioned that there was a good review of Writers in Revolt in Labor History, a monthly publication that he's very fond of.  We don't get it here but perhaps you already know of the review.  Fred's at 2525 N. St. Louis, Chicago 60647 and since he subscribes to Labor History he'd probably send you the review if you haven't seen it.\n    This winter I read for the first time Richard Wright's Black Boy.  It had terrific impact, far more than Native Son because it wasn't a contrived story.  Also gained sufficient momentum from the \"Revolution\" class to read more on anarchy - particularly the Russian anarchists.  So another winter has passed - cold, comfortable - and we have the prospect of the nice long beautiful days and some more searching for that elusive gold.

stamped letter head  DON J. SHINEW   3781 Cherry Hill Court    Northwood, Ohio  43619\nSept 6, 1985\nDear Jack:\n\n   Thank you again for the book \"The Weed King & Other Stories\" and for thoughtfully sending on the autograph which is now pasted in place.  I have finished it and enjoyed the book even though many of the events in the contents are of course not joyful in that sense.  Nevertheless there is humor to relish such as \"she\", \"He\" and \"It,\" the trilogy your Mother was enamored with, \"the siren\", not the story itself but the pronounciation, [sic] and the physical attributes of darling Charley.\n     We are sorry to hear about the diabetes difficulties but hope it is now under control.   There are a number of people in Lillian's relation that have and still are battling that plague.\n     Last night we drove down Byrn [sic] Road for the first time in over a year or so.

After living all my life as a so called superior white man, I have now come among real humans and am happy.\n   No doubt you will ask yourself what is my purpose in writing to you.   There is no purpose except that I spoke to a lawyer who shares offices with me and he said he knows you.  His name is Mr. Marx.

Your information concerning the San Francisco group is very welcome.  Just in case they fail to contact me, would you be so kind as to give their address?   This would not be a betrayal of confidence as I would simply put them on the mailing list to receive the first issue of underlined: Great-Concord Tide which will be out very shortly.  You, too, are of course on the list and so I will not take time now to explain the program; it will be covered in this and subsequent issues of the bulletin.

I'll assume you do remember me. --\n\n   In May 1971 I finally quit writing - after 24+ years, 14+ books, 300+ submissions - gruesome statistics like that.

It didn't last long in the rare book market.  I'm not surprised!\n   Hope all is well.  Let me know what's happening and if there's anything I can do for you.\n\nBest,\nRalph","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":143064,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/143064","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/cf7732d169358e4c21767c87354beafd.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/cf7732d169358e4c21767c87354beafd.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/cf7732d169358e4c21767c87354beafd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cf7732d169358e4c21767c87354beafd.jpg"},"added":"2023-04-04T19:22:01+00:00","modified":"2023-05-15T20:46:13+00:00","filename":"cf7732d169358e4c21767c87354beafd.jpg","authentication":"3b5debbf4f5bbdbfce2e908cd3f27498","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"992006198805867_midwest_ms_conroy_box_00028_fl_01440_000006.jpg","size":90115,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":939,"resolution_y":1200,"compression_ratio":0.0266580878002603237353351772753740078769624233245849609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00028], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00028], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00028], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1623,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1623","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"letterhead  File:Print of head of a hat-wearing man   JOSEPH THE PROVIDER   BOOKS BOUGHT & SOLD\nRalph B.

I finally visited Ashley Buch, who is, as you suggested, a helluva nice guy.  I even got a copy of his short novel, underlined:  Beyond Laughter which we will list in the catalogue.  I'd also like to list the enclosed underlined: A World to Win at the healthy price of 50.00.  I think I can get that for it - if you will please write in the copy something concerning the book - why you wrote it, what sources it came from, who it was about (any one of those) - and inscribe it to Tom (or Dick or Harry) and don't date it.  If you have any negative feelings about doing this, then just sign it, but an inscription of the sort I outlined makes it a more interesting book, to be sure.  We're doing another radical section only this one will be called proletarian fiction and will be confined to literature.  \n Hope all is well - keep punching.

IMPORTED RUSSIAN CANDIES    41 ST. NICHOLAS TERRACE  Cor. West 129th Street  NEW YORK CITY\n\nMarch 29, 1932\nJack Conroy,\nRebel Poets.\nDear Sir.\n\n    You wrote a letter to me in February in which you manifested a strong interest in the Messelprom Russian candies which I handle.  This letter was in answer to my advertisement in the Daily Worker.\n     There is a tremendous distribution of Soviet candies and other Soviet products, in New York and other large cities, but we are very anxious to reach the outlaying sections of the country.  I have spoken about you with Robert Whitcomb, advertising man at the \"Daily\" and he believes that, with your contacts, you can secure quite a sale, or at least interest, in these candies.\n     I am making out a descriptive price list for you.  The carriage charges, as you say, are the greatest handicap.  Amtorg has an agency in Los Angeles, but they probably have to add on the same costs you would have to bear.

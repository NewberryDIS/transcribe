Payne   Charleston S.C.    Carmel   Dec. 15 1834  \n\nDear Sir  Yesterday I had the pleasure of receiving yours of the 8th Inst. and should rejoice to comply fully with your request, were it in my power but my information relative to Indian antiquities is not sufficient to justify me in attempting to give any thing like a connected view of them. And though I have written many things from the lips of the old men which were to me interesting, yet these sketches are imperfect and detached, and could not, without some time, be prepared for inspection. The most therefore that I can do at the present is to furnish you with a few out lines of the antiquities of the Cherokees. \nThey consider themselves, and the other Indians in North America as the real, or peculiar people, and the people especially beloved of God.  They say they came from beyond the sea; but concerning their history previous to their coming to this continent I have obtained no information, except they say their fathers had sacred fire which God handed down to them from above.  They speak of passing through a wilderness long ago, when they carried a certain building which they set up whenever they halted, and in, or about which, the priests sat. (on this continent.)  They say they kept their holy fire till their enemies came upon them, destroyed their building in which it was kept, & drove them away. After this, to supply the place of the holy fire, they made new fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together till they took fire. This new fire they used in their hunting, and war expeditions, and on some other occasions.  The Cherokees appear to have commenced their year with the blooming of peach trees, or about that time, that is, in March; yet their annual New moons commenced with the new moon in September. The Inuks, however, in order to unite all their religious festivals in one, make their newmoons commence with the feast of first fruits.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70399,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70399","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/07fedc1fbae9a5ef392e86628fb40e27.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/07fedc1fbae9a5ef392e86628fb40e27.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/07fedc1fbae9a5ef392e86628fb40e27.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/07fedc1fbae9a5ef392e86628fb40e27.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:19+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:21+00:00","filename":"07fedc1fbae9a5ef392e86628fb40e27.jpg","authentication":"2665187c7163140c31215efea028ff55","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00005_o2 copy.jpg","size":490046,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2167,"compression_ratio":0.041877830761079003207836279898401699028909206390380859375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["050646+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["050646+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["050646+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"07fedc1fbae9a5ef392e86628fb40e27.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423933,"FileSize":490046,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2167\"","Height":2167,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2167,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:07:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4345},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:06:46","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:06:46","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":48,"SubSecTimeDigitized":48,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2167,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The ancient government of the Cherokees was a theocracy.  It is said the god at first, or at the commencement of their government, appointed a certain man to be at the head of all their civil & religious affairs strikeout & instructed him in all things relative to his duty, and declared that the office should be hereditary in his family.  This chief priest, or supreme ruler, had seven counsellors who were also priests.  The first of these was his right hand man, and next to him in authority.  He had also a messenger always at his call.  Priests of a lower order reside in all the important towns, each having his seven counsellors, right hand man, & messenger, and were at the head of all civil & religious affairs in their respective towns.  The offices of all were hereditary to a certain extent.  9. The above mentioned persons, as far as I can learn, constituted the National council.  The council however, supported by seven parts, equa distant from each other, near a septagram.  Towards the back part of this were three white seats.  That in the middle was\noccupied by the chief priest.  No other human must touch it. One of the others by his right hand man; but who occupied the third sacred seat, I cannot now determine.  The other members of course sat on the right & left, so as to form a semicircle.  Back of the three sacred seats, was a holy place where no person must ever go but the priests.  There was kept the holy ark, &c. &c.  Anciently the Cherokees had four towns of refuge, to which any one who killed another might flee, and where the avenger of blood, that is, the nighest male relative will not touch him. The door yard of any priest was also a refuge, and it was said that if the slayer could get in sight of the chief priest, the avenger must not touch him.  The refugees, however, if guilty of willful murder, were not safe; for although the avenger of blood gave them up, and tho the priests, to whom they fled, did not publicly decide against them, yet they placed them in such circumstances, either in battle, or otherwise, as would assure their death.  Public criminals were sometimes stoned and\nsometimes were thrown from a precipice, & sometimes otherwise killed. n  With regard to bodily wounds &c. the Mosaic law of retaliation was very strictly observed.

This I believe is the case with the other tribes also. The individuals in these families were supposed to be too nearly related to admit of intermarriages, and therefore such marriages were punished with death.  All the members of one family, i.e. one clan, associated together as parents and children, or as brother & sister, or near relatives.  Thomas Smith  It is said that anciently young people could not marry without the consent of the parents of both parties, and also the approbation of the priest who was to officiate. They were married for life. The marriage of a priest was attended with peculiar ceremonies. His wife must be a person approved by his seven counsellors, she must be a virgin, who had never had a husband, and of unblemished character. Great honour was attached to her character, and in some respects she filled the place of her husband on his disease, till the consecration of his successor, though, in that case, his official duties, generally, were performed by his right hand man.  J Pridget  T Smith  On the death of the high priest, his assistant, or right hand man, appointed the time for the consecration of his successor, and dispatched his messenger to notify the priest through the nation, giving him a string of wild hemp, braided, and having as many knots tied in it as there were nights previous to the meeting. This messenger went personally to all the towns lying in a direct course?, leaving other towns to be notified at his request.  He cut a knot from his string every morning, till the priests being assembled at the time appointed, sent each his messenger to the candidate for office, requesting him to accept the appointment, supposing he would need encouragement and persuasion to bring him forward.

These had small bells fastened to them about their ankles.  Finger rings were common to both men & women.  Anciently it was common for a whole town to enclose a large field, in which each family had its particular share, separated by some known marker.  In this all the town, men & women worked together, first in one part and then in another, according to the direction of one? whom they had selected to manage the business, and in this respect, they called their leader.  But at other times, when not employed at the common field, the men did but little except hum.  strikeout  The women got their wood for cooking, unless as they might be assisted by very old men.  They also carried all the water for family use, pounded the corn, prepared the food for the family, performed all the washing up &c.  But though custom attached the heaviest part of the labour to the women, yet they were cheerful and voluntary in performing it.  What others may have discovered among the Indians I cannot tell, but though I have been about nineteen years among the Cherokees strikeout: yet I have perceived nothing of the slavish, servile fear, on the part of women, so often spoken of.  The women had various methods of baking their bread.  Sometimes they made it in thin cakes, & put it on the hot clay or stone hearth & covered it with hot coals and ashes & sometime put a loaf on the hot hearth & covered it with a shallow earthen pan & then put on coals; sometimes they set the shallow pan on coals and baked the cakes on it.  Again, they mixed their bread in a shallow basket, round, and perhaps 18 inches to two feet in diameter.  The dough was spread over the bottom of this basket, as thick as the loaf was desired made smooth on top, and covered with the large leaves of the cucumber tree.  The basket was then turned bottom upwards on the hot hearth, and taken off, leaving the loaf lying on the leaves.  This was then covered with the same kind of leaves and afterwards with ashes & coals.  In this manner they made loaves as large as they pleased.  They made great use of parched corn meal.  They parched their corn by putting it in a pot with sifted ashes, stirring it constantly while over the fire.  When sufficiently parched, they sifted out the ashes, leaving the pure corn.

In order to this, he placed the ark, the red post covered with the fawn skin on which lay the diamond before him, as in the council house, and during his prayer fixed his eyes on the ark.  Having approached near the enemy, all halted.

If any of you have left property of any kind about which you are troubled, return and take care of it. Or if any of you are fearful, and afraid of the enemy, now return. After this, all who retain the position in the army were supposed to be bold,  unharrassed, and efficient warriors, and therefore they generally engaged with great confidence and fierceness in the fight.  During the contest, the priest stood back unless he saw some of the warriors giving back, and in that case, he went forward with great fury, and either conquered or died.  The conflict being ended, they set their faces towards home, but not hastily, or disorderly. before arriving at the town from whence they started, a messenger was sent forward to give notice of their approach, and of their intention to be at a certain place at a given time. To that place, therefore, the people repaired at the specified time.  As the warriors approached, two men, followed by the women, advanced toward them commencing a hymn, or song, in honour of their valiant & warlike deeds.  But though the two men commenced this song, yet the women immediately caught it, and went forward chanting the praises of the warriors.  Each warrior delivered his spoil to his wife, or nearest female relative, who took it home, while the warriors continued their march to the council house. There they were met by the resident priests and the people to express their joy in a dance, which continued during the night. After this was over, and the soldiers had returned home, they could associate with their wives as usual, but not before. Therefore no female prisoners are ever defiled by Indian warriors. The priest for the wars had a peculiar dress.  His cape was red, as was also his seat in council. signature: Silversmith Nettle  What musical instruments were used in war (if any) I have not understood. It is said that the priests anciently had trumpets made of long necked gourds, for their own use exclusively. The people used at dances, a kettle drum and a pipe, made of cane, three or four inches long. They had also a flute made of cane, perhaps  a foot long, blown, as the pipe, at the end.  Dear Sir, I would now gladly proceed to give you some account of the feast of first fruits and other religious festivals, but in that case, the mail would pass, & I fear, I could have no opportunity to forward my communication in time to meet you in Charleston.

May 10 -- 1836,  Dear Sir, Yours of Feb Feb 24th was duly received, though various hindrances have prevented my answering it till now. This letter, sir, gave me peculiar joy, as affording an opportunity of making some remarks concerning my former communications, and of giving you the assurance that whatever I can do to unclear your enquiries relative to the Indians generally, and especially the Cherokees, I shall consider no burthen, but a part of my delightful employment, which calls for no other reward than the hope of pleasing one, devoted to the cause of humanity and virtue. But were it possible for me to oblige you, sir, by any means, so as to justify me in asking a reward, my request would only be, that the Indians of this continent might share a place in the affections of your heart. I say, \"the Indians,\" because I have been somewhat acquainted with several tribes, and find them all the same kind of people, and to me, peculiarly lovely, when not despoiled of their national character by the oppression of others, as by foreign views introduced among them.  With regard to my former communications, please indulge me in a few remarks.  First, In writing by mail, if much time is devoted to apologies, reasons, explanations viz but little room is left for the subject matter of the communication.  On this account I did not state to you the reason why I withheld some information which you requested, and forwarded and some, perhaps, which you did not request.  Most of the ancient customs are confirmed by many of the old people, which others are remembered but by few.  For instance, the use of the war trumpets, made of a certain bone, and Buffalo horns, may be learned doubtless from many, but from one man only, have I learned the use of a trumpet made of longnecked gourds.  These are said to have been used only by the priests. Anciently they lived in towns, contiguous to each other. When the principal priest wished to collect the people of his town for any national, or religious purpose, he blew his trumpet, and his counsellors, or all the town, assembled, doubtless according to the signal.  Its in the principal town, so in all the other towns of any unclear.  Its inferior priest, with his right hand man, and seven counsellors, constituted the civil & religious tribunal in each town. Each priest had the same kind of a trumpet, for the same purpose, and no other persons, except the priests, were allowed the use of their trumpets.

Second, another remark I would make, is the following By being handed down through successive generations, their traditions have become burthened with much rubbish. When this seems to affect the traditions, so as to render them apparently fabulous, I either say nothing about those traditions, or comment with them the rubbish by which they are materially affected. But the traditions, communicated in my last letter, are not, as I can perceive, injured at all, in this manner. The character and circumstances of the old men who related them to me, -- other traditions and customs, connected with these, especially some not mentioned in the Bible, and which can be discovered only by a careful examination of the ancient history of the Jews, and their entire ignorance of these antiquarians respecting every other part of the Bible, prove to my mind that their traditions above refered to have been handed down from present to children, entirely independent of any information derived from white men on this continent. Though, when they started to go to the land promised their fathers, they were fleeing from their enemies, yet not one can tell who those enemies were, nor where they they lived, though their leader ascended the mountain, received the land &c. yet no one can tell the name of that leader. Though their greatest prophet, who appointed their priests, religious festivals was by the name of Moses (Cherokee Wa si) yet no one now knows this man to be the same as their leader through the wilderness. The Indians state the reason why the land was marked, and handed down verbally, had been forgotten, this though very probably correct, could not have been from from the Bible. The Indians affirm that God (or rather the Son of God) when He gave the law on a mountain, commanded them to sing, or repeat certain prayers, early in the morning & at evening. The Jews also affirm that God at the time He gave the law, commanded them to repeat, morning & evening, their phylactory sentences, yet this command is not contained in the Bible, so that the Indian could learn it from there. Jewish historians say that, not only the tribes, but the families, or clans, in each tribe, kept distinct from each other in all their marches and encampments which in the wilderness the Indians affirm the same with regard to their tribes &","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70412,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70412","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/93b676da82522464c9158ba894bd4423.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/93b676da82522464c9158ba894bd4423.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/93b676da82522464c9158ba894bd4423.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/93b676da82522464c9158ba894bd4423.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:28+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:20+00:00","filename":"93b676da82522464c9158ba894bd4423.jpg","authentication":"ae5cc713e864b9b5bb58a7c625d5366f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00018_o2.jpg","size":531722,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2169,"compression_ratio":0.04539743524068100277713000423318590037524700164794921875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["051219+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["051219+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["051219+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"93b676da82522464c9158ba894bd4423.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423933,"FileSize":531722,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2169\"","Height":2169,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2169,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5100},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:12:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:12:19","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":22,"SubSecTimeDigitized":22,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2169,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"clans under the same circumstances, and say their clans were distinguished from each other by means of feathers of different colours. But these things they could not have learned from jewish history, as they were ignorant of it. Though the Indians say that while in that dreadful wilderness, they came near perishing with thirst, and were relieved by water flowing from a rock; yet no one can tell by what means this water was made to flow from the rock. The Indians say that at a certain time in that wilderness, while numbers were walking along in Indian file, the ground enailred? under them & let them down and their closed upon them, but their manner of relating this event, shows evidently that they did not derive their information from the Bible. Thus we might proceed with regard to all the traditions which I have communicated to you, and satisfy & trust any candid enquirers that they were not derived from any instruction received from the whites, but really handed down among themselves. Dear Sir, as soon as convenient, after the return of Mr. Ross from Washington City, I hope to lay the result of my enquiries before him. His intention I believe, is to call together some of the most noted antiquarians to assist him in examining the correctness of my writings. Should they pronounce them correct, I could then, with confidence, transmit them to you, and should rejoice to do so. In that case, sir, you might revise them as coming directly from Mr. Ross, and such antiquarians as might sanction them, without any notice of their having passed through the hands of a missionary. This might add to their influence. Should you therefore consider it possible for me to serve you, in the manner above stated, please give me notice where to direct my communications directing to Brainerd Cher.

You are doubt aware that I promised Mr Ross to send nothing relative to Indian antiquities, abroad for publication without previously submitting it to his inspection. I took the liberty however to state a few things to you, on the supposition that Mr Ross' approbation had been obtained. Leaning on the same supposition, I now present you with some traditions, handed down from generation to generation, known and communicated, as I am told, long before any white man appeared in this country. I must beg leave, however, considering my obligations to Mr Ross, to request that nothing be published in my name, unless you may wish to refer to me as a voucher? to the truth of these traditions. The old? Cherokees taught that God created man of red earth, and made the woman of one of man's ribs. God soon taught mankind to build high places, on which to erect places of worship, and alters?, and offer sacrifices. There the priests called the people together, and on some occasions continued their preaching the whole day; while the audience? remained perfectly silent. The priest enjoined perfect obedience to God, and forbid all idle & foolish talk, all lewdness, and polygamy. He taught children to be industrious and obedient to their parents. He enjoined obedience to God in secret, as well as in public, because God always saw them & was with them. He also delivered predictions of future events. He forewarned the people that if they did not serve? God, He would bring a flood to drown them all. But the earth would not be destroyed by water but once, the second destruction would be by fire. About sun set the priest offered sacrifice on an alter of stone or a hant? two feet high. The people in process of time becoming more more wicked, would not obey what was told them but pursued their own wicked course. God then sent a messenger to a certain man, commanding him to warn the people to turn from their sins, or he would bring a flood to destroy them. This man obeyed, but to no effect. The messenger was sent again & again, but the people would not hear. Then God directed this man to build a house sufficiently large to accommodate his own family, and some of all the different kinds of animals. This being done the animals came to him & he took them in and shut the doors. The rain then commenced and continued forty days and forty nights. At the same time the water gushed out of the ground, as fast as it came down from the clouds.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70415,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70415","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f21771e6910e27dca4aa26be22718f3e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f21771e6910e27dca4aa26be22718f3e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f21771e6910e27dca4aa26be22718f3e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f21771e6910e27dca4aa26be22718f3e.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:30+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:20+00:00","filename":"f21771e6910e27dca4aa26be22718f3e.jpg","authentication":"683ef337e3c5bc35092c3e5bd567dc22","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00021_o2 copy.jpg","size":516974,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2177,"compression_ratio":0.043976079892479001676175442980820662342011928558349609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["051317+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["051317+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["051317+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f21771e6910e27dca4aa26be22718f3e.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423934,"FileSize":516974,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2177\"","Height":2177,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2177,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:12","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5009},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:13:17","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:13:17","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":88,"SubSecTimeDigitized":88,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2177,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"At the end of forty days the rain ceased, and sometime after the man opened a window, and sent out a raven to find dry land, but the raven returned, finding no rest. At length he sent out a turtle dove which returned with a branch or unclear in its mouth. The man looked and saw a little spot of dry ground at a distance, to which he directed? this house, and soon found the house resting on the top of a mountain. As the water dried away, it being the proper season of the year to commence his farming business, he engaged in cultivating the ground. Nu tra we Raven. Not long after the flood, the people determined to put up a building which would reach to heaven. They accordingly commenced, building with stone, and after carrying it to a very great height, God, being displeased stopped their work, and gave them different languages, so that from that time they were dispersed over the earth, and soon began to have wars with each other. Till then all spake one language. Nu tra we. Thomas Smith. The old men say that one of their great ancestors had twelve sons, of whom came twelve tribes. These people (or the ancestors of the Indians) were chosen? of God to be his peculiar? people. The Lord told them they should be the father of all other nations. He gave them a certain country and commanded them to go to it, but in order to get there they would have great waters and a great wilderness to pass through. When They started to go to that country, they were fleeing from their enemies, but the Lord told their leader to strike a certain great water, they came to soon after setting out, and He would cause the water to divide, that they might pass through, & then would bring the water together so as effectually to stop their enemies. Their leader therefore struck the water with a rod, and it divided, so that all passed through strikeout: as dry ground? the water then closing together prevented the progress of their enemies. Not long after this God came down onto a mountain, and the mountain shone with peculiar brightness, and their leader went up onto the mountain with God. Or rather, with the son of God.

While there in the wilderness they were directed to erect a certain building. This had four posts, held together by joists?, & was covered with a cloth made of deers hair & turkey feathers. This was taken down when they travelled & set up when they stopped. The wilderness they had to pass through was very dreadful. At one time they came where there were many very poisonous serpents, and many of the people died of their bite. At another time they came to a place where was no water, they searched in all the low places & dug with their staves? but could find none. At length their leader found a beautiful spring issuing out of a rock. At another time while in that wilderness, some of the people were walking along in single file, and the ground split open under them, so that they fell in & the ground then closed upon them and shut them in. In short the old men said the wilderness was so dreadful they never could have got through if the Lord had not led them. As it was, a great part died before they got to the country which God had given them. The Lord had told them that just before getting to their country they would have a large river to cross. On coming to this river their leader struck the water with a rod, and the water above stood in a heap, while that below ran off, and the people then went over on dry ground. When all were over, the water above flowed down as before. They then settled down, and called the town where they first stopped Tah mi too? (This however is not a Cherokee word & no one knows its meaning). After they settled in that country they had a very great king who was also a preacher & taught the people many things. He was not however equal to one they had before the flood. The old men say that long ago, no one can tell how long, they had a peculiar priest named, Moses, and have had none equal to him since. He told what had been done from the creation, and what was to be hereafter, - directed them how to make their kings and priests, appointed all their feasts & religious ceremonies, & directed how to observe them, and commanded them to obey his instructions forever. (This priest was doubtless the same as their leader through the wilderness, as he seems to have lived at the same period i.e. in the remotest ages of their national existence) While passing through that wilderness God handed down fire from heaven, which they were always to keep burning, & with which were to offer all their","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70417,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70417","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/6a1702f51d905acc539edd63b66171c9.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/6a1702f51d905acc539edd63b66171c9.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/6a1702f51d905acc539edd63b66171c9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6a1702f51d905acc539edd63b66171c9.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:32+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:20+00:00","filename":"6a1702f51d905acc539edd63b66171c9.jpg","authentication":"3e796550d00222c5eb1fca70e9bf64cb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00023_o2 copy.jpg","size":445322,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2182,"compression_ratio":0.03779424245510400182102017652141512371599674224853515625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["051351+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["051351+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["051351+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6a1702f51d905acc539edd63b66171c9.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423934,"FileSize":445322,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2182\"","Height":2182,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2182,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:13","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3834},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:13:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:13:51","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":83,"SubSecTimeDigitized":83,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2182,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"sacrifices.

They say however that their great ancestors had twelve sons, from whom came twelve tribes - that their fathers were [[unclear of God above all other people, and that God told them they should be the father of all other nations.

They speak also of two remarkable journies, one when fleeing from their enemies to a country which God had given them, and the other when they came to this continent. With regard to the seven clans or families in each tribe, they suppose that there were the posterity of seven families, and of course the individuals of each, are considered as members of the same family still, and not allowed to intermarry with each other, being blood connexions.\nWhen they came to this continent, a certain tribe Delawares, took the lead. These were the grand fathers of all the other Indians, while the Cherokees were uncles to the Creeks, Choctaws, Chicasaws & some other tribes, again, were brothers to the Cherokees. Thus all the red people on this continent are one people, the descendants of the same family. On their journey as they came to a great water, either just before crossing, or just after, they are not sure, they separated, a part going Northwardly, and a part Southwardly. Those who went to the North settled in two towns called Ka no wo gi, & Nu ta gi. The Cherokees say that anciently people, three or four hundred years, were considered boys till 20 or 30 years old, and then warriors till 50 or 60.

Sometimes we should suppose it to have been a pure theocracy, in the hands of priests and prophets, who were considered as acting under the immediate direction of God. Again perceiving the sceptre in the hands of one man, who did not offer sacrifice, & of course was not a priest, we should conclude the government monarchical. And again, on perceiving the power of the elders, or old men, we should be ready to suppose the government to have been an aristocracy. It is probable therefore that they did not adhere to the same form of government at all times. Yet, notwithstanding all the variations to which their government was subject, one characteristic continued the unclear.

This messenger went personally to all the towns situated in a direct course, and the other towns were notified at his request. He cut a knot from his string every morning, till the priests being assembled at the time appointed, sent their messengers to the candidate, urging him to accept the office, supposing that his modesty would render persuasion necessary in order to bring him forward to so distinguished an office.

And besides these four towns, every priests' door yard was a refuge; and if the man slayer only came in sight of the High priest, the avenger of blood could not touch him. \nWhen a man slayer fled to a priest, the priest either blew his trumpet or directed his messenger to call the town together, and then in their presence declared the man acquitted. When, on farther examination, it appeared that the man was really guilty, he was not publicly condemned, but was privately exposed to the shafts of death either in battle or some other way, so as, generally, to be soon taken away. Public criminals were sometimes stoned, or killed with some weapon, but more generally were taken to the top of a high precipice, where, having their elbows tied behind them, and their feet drawn up, & tied under them, were cast headlong and dashed to pieces on the rocks below.\nIn punishing more trifling offences the law of retaliation was strictly observed, \"an eye for an eye\" unclear (Johnson Pridget). Beside the king & his attendants, and the priests and their counsellors, there were certain elders, or old men residing at or near the council house, whose influence and authority were considerable, especially among the boys and young people.

From the manner of his induction into office, however, it would seem that he held a priestly, as well as warlike character. The ceremonies on that occasion were as follows. The candidate, being nominated by the young warriors, and the nomination being approved by the war chiefs, was notified of the appointment and requested to accept the office.

None sung, but moved their feet at the sound of the drum, and frequently raised the war whoop. The drum was a pot made as common Indian earthern ware, having the top covered with a coon skin. Small bells were fastened round the rim, which rattled as the drum was beat. This dance being ended, all bathed, or washed all over before they slept. Here it may be well to observe that no warrior must have any intercourse either with his wife or any other woman, from the time of enlisting till the expedition was entirely, completed. This amounts for the fact that female captives are never polluted by Indian warriors. Soon after commencing their march, They sang another war song, consisting of seven verses, and at the end of each verse, raised the war whoop four times. Their fastings, vigils & various other religious ceremonies, especially their manner of making, carrying & using new fire, as well as the order of their marches and encampments are all interesting, but too lengthy to be full described here. Their encampments for the night were ordered with peculiar propriety; all the distinguished officers sleeping in the centre, and the common warriors in a circle about them. See on another sheet. On drawing near the enemy, if an open, fair battle was intended, they halted at a place most convenient for making the unclear. Here, after the usual speeches & ceremonies, all being ready for the engagement, the war trumpet was blown, by a selected person. This was made of bone, from a foot to a foot & half long, and made a very shrill, low noise, which could be heard a great distance. The warriors then instantly raised the war whoop, i.e. shouted for the battle and sprang forward. They ran so as to form two wings, as if to enclose the enemy, which the chief officer &suit? went directly forward, meeting those of the same order in the enemies ranks. The chief officer never retreated, but conquered or died, unless, as was sometimes the case, his warriors, perceiving his danger, seized him by force & snatched him from the power of the enemy. But the more general method of the Cherokees was to set an ambush for their enemies, so as to form an acute angle, & by various artifices draw them in & surround them. Many strategems were used to decoy the enemy and draw them into danger. On engaging in an offensive war, their attention was turned to different ceremonies and in some respects they pursued a different course, yet leaning, apparently on God.

This was carried by a person selected for the purpose, and was raised when they encamped, and especially at the place of rendezvous just before battle. A certain priest & his right hand man took charge of the ark, the holy fire, the diamond or crystalline quartz, and other holy things, by which to unclear advice and protection from above. (More full hereafter) The armour of a warrior was as follows, vir. First, His shield. This was made sometimes of hickory or other tough wood, and sometimes of Buffalo hide taken from the forehead, which was very thick. It was in the share of ancient shields, and used in the same manner, being held in the hand which bent the bow, to keep the arrow of the enemy from the face. In travelling, it was carried by a string going round the neck and under the left arm, yet so as to hang over the left shoulder, and above whenever load might be on the back. If a warrior lost his shield he was disgraced by being set to cooking for the others. Second, His breastplate. This was made of the thickest part of the Buffalo hide, and so placed as to cover the forepart of the body. Third, His helmet. This consisted of a band of the thickest part of a Buffalo hide, ornamented with red feathers. Fourth, a defense for the left arm, of the same kind of skin to defend it from the bow string. Fifth, His quiver. This was made of hard Buffalo skin, large at the top and small at the bottom, and hung down their back in such a manner that he could readily draw the arrows with his right hand. This had a lid attached to it, to keep out the water in rainy weather. Sixth, His bow & arrow. The arrow was armed with a flint, & sometimes poisoned, and the feathers, now tied, were anciently glued to the arrow.

A war expedition being ended the warriors set their faces towards home, observing however the most perfect order, & implicit obedience to their officers. Before arriving at the town from whence they started, a messenger was sent forward to give notice of their approach, and of their intention to be at a certain place at a given time. To that place, therefore, the people repaired at the specified time. As the warriors approached, two men followed by the women advanced toward them, commencing a hymn in honour of their valour & warlike deeds. Though the two men commenced singing, yet the women immediately caught the tune and went forward chanting the praise of the beloved defenders of their country. The warriors advanced with a steady, & dignified step, and each delivering to his wife, - his mother, sister, or unclear female relative, the spoils he had taken from the enemy, continued his march to the council house, where all the civil authorities, & the people generally were waiting to receive them. Here it may be said that this apparent indifference in the warriors on meeting their dearest friends, after such as separation, manifested a stoical stupidity quite unbecoming. But let us consider that the warriors having slain persons in battle, touched dead bodies & otherwise contracting uncleanness, could not, without violating their consciences, touch even the hand of any clean person, till they had been purified. Of course, if they had not kept their feelings completely bound, they would have been in the greatest possible danger of violating the commands of God. On arriving at the council house they were received with peculiar joy & respect, yet no one, could touch them and they could have no particular intercourse with their families, till the time for their purification had expired. This according to some was four days, according to others twelve & according to others twenty four. Probably the time for purifying the soldiers was longer or shorter according to the bloodiness of the war in which they had been engaged.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70432,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70432","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/36ea1abd978a7805bd1a17d508d07400.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/36ea1abd978a7805bd1a17d508d07400.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/36ea1abd978a7805bd1a17d508d07400.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/36ea1abd978a7805bd1a17d508d07400.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:43+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:20+00:00","filename":"36ea1abd978a7805bd1a17d508d07400.jpg","authentication":"c1f7eab5e6165f4a66ce95fb23176d76","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00036_o2 copy.jpg","size":572309,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2201,"compression_ratio":0.0481522708533159982113858177399379201233386993408203125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052242+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052242+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052242+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"36ea1abd978a7805bd1a17d508d07400.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423934,"FileSize":572309,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2201\"","Height":2201,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2201,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:25","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5885},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:22:42","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:22:42","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":44,"SubSecTimeDigitized":44,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2201,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"or perhaps the time for purifying warriors, differed in different periods of their history. The same priest & counselors who sanctified the warriors for the war, now purified them from the pollution contracted by it.

Various ceremonies were observed in purification, but the most important seem to be puking to cleanse the body inwardly and waiting? to cleanse it outwardly. Having spent the set time at the council house, the last night was observed as a vigil. Two dances in particular engaged their attention. In the morning, just at sun rise a sacrifice was offered, - burnt with the same fire they had taken to war. The warriors then all repaired to a stream of water, in which they plunge entirely seven times, four times with their heads to the east, and three times towards the west. This being done all repair to their homes, and associate with their wives & friends as usual. But such as had been wounded must continue at the council house a long time in a state of? separation. They might dance with others, yet they must always carry a certain kind of staff by which they would be distinguished, and must not associate with their wives till the time for their purification had expired.

In each town of any note was a respectable man, having been selected to attend to ball plays. The ancient priests had nothing to do in ball plays. They were therefore never considered as being connected with their religious ceremonies. But when any young men desired to bring forward a ball play, they consulted their head man (with respect to ball plays) and resolved to send a challenge to a certain town or district, and selected one or two young men to carry the challenge. These messengers went directly to the ball play chief in their town or district challenged  and spent some time with him before telling their business. They then notified him of the challenge, and he immediately gave notice to some of the players, and enquired his bounds, that is, how far he might go for players. This man, with seven others, as counsellors, were competent to act. In accepting the challenge, they appointed the time and place for playing. Anciently ball players must be men of good character, who would play honourably, without fraud or deception. They were famous, - men of renown. Each party then selected an elderly man to direct the dance, another person to sing for the players, another to whoop - a musician for the seven women, on the seventh night. They also elected a conjurer, and seven (players) to wait on him, and seven women to provide food for them, and to dance on the seventh night. An open place in the woods, having been selected, and a fire prepared, the party assembled about dark, and seated themselves some distance from the fire. In sue time, the director of the dance, calling the players, they came forward, with their ball sticks in their hands, the whooper then raised a war whoop, or one nearly resembling it, to which all the players answered, Wah. The singer then commenced Wa hi ie (or more lately hye ko ku ni) wa hi ie &. The players then commenced dancing, responding to the musician, hah, hah, hah, at every repetition of the word wa hi ie, and making motions with their ball sticks, while dancing around the fire, as if actually engaged in play.

It is by this native politeness alone, and not by the chains of tyrants, that the chiefs bind the hearts of their subjects, and carry them wherever they will.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70439,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70439","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/32fd469d3bfebf3a677a7beb71b454dd.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/32fd469d3bfebf3a677a7beb71b454dd.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/32fd469d3bfebf3a677a7beb71b454dd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/32fd469d3bfebf3a677a7beb71b454dd.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:49+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:20+00:00","filename":"32fd469d3bfebf3a677a7beb71b454dd.jpg","authentication":"624ee095a0abd1a639598f736d00f768","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00043_o2.jpg","size":653828,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2207,"compression_ratio":0.054861467720551997107047981216965126805007457733154296875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052551+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052551+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052551+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"32fd469d3bfebf3a677a7beb71b454dd.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423934,"FileSize":653828,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2207\"","Height":2207,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2207,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6057},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:25:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:25:51","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":56,"SubSecTimeDigitized":56,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2207,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Dress ? 19 The Ancient dress of kings at their inauguration was as follows First, a shirt of white leather, extending to the hips, second, breeches, rather a petticote, of white leather, extending down to the knees.

Then a narrow strip of soft, pliable bark, as long as the blanket was to be wide, was put down and feathers placed on it from end to end. Then a similar strip of bark was laid on the top, and there two strips of bark were sewed together with bard thread. Then another strip was put under, and another tier of feathers and strip of bark over, and so on, till one, or more blankets were finished. This, with Turkey feathers & dress hair it is said, they made the covering for the tabernacle in the wilderness.\nDomestic concerns\nFormerly the women got their own wood for cooking, unless as they might be assisted by very old men. They also carried all the water for family use. It was considered disgraceful for men or boys to be seen carrying water. The women pounded all the corn, and prepared food for the family. They also performed the washing. Women, not only performed the labours of the kitchen, but they also assisted in the field. Formerly, it was the custom for a whole town to inclose one large field in which each family had its particular share. In this, all the town men and women worked together, first in one part, and then in another, avowing to the direction of one whom they had selected to manage the business, and whom therefore, in this respect, they called their head man. Individual fields were separated from each by a ridge thrown up, or by stones, or unclear up.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70442,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70442","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/47b6ed23706de19349e67519fa46285e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/47b6ed23706de19349e67519fa46285e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/47b6ed23706de19349e67519fa46285e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/47b6ed23706de19349e67519fa46285e.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:51+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:20+00:00","filename":"47b6ed23706de19349e67519fa46285e.jpg","authentication":"f009416043183f3315509d261c16aadc","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00046_o2 copy.jpg","size":612695,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2213,"compression_ratio":0.051270690030291998784406359845888800919055938720703125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052632+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052632+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052632+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"47b6ed23706de19349e67519fa46285e.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423934,"FileSize":612695,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2213\"","Height":2213,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2213,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6239},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:26:32","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:26:32","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":20,"SubSecTimeDigitized":20,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2213,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"P.RR. Anciently, Cherokee women had various methods of baking their bread. Sometimes they made it in thin cakes, and put it on the hot clay or stone, and covered it with hot ashes & coals; and sometimes they covered it first with a shallow earthen pan, and then with ashes and coals. sometimes they put the shallow earthen pan on coals, and baked thin cakes on that. Again they mixed their bread in a large shallow basket. This would be perhaps two feet in diameter. The bottom of this being covered with dough two or three inches thick, the upper side of the dough was smoothed, and covered with cucumber leaves. Then the basket was turned bottom upwards on the hot clay or stone hearth, and taken off, leaving the loaf lying on the leaves. The loaf was then covered with the same kind of leaves, and then with ashes and coals. In this manner they would make loaves as large as they pleased. And that manner of baking gave the bread a most excellent flavour.\nAs they had many ways of baking bread, so they had many kinds of bread to bake in consequence of mixing with their meal, chestnuts, potatoes, beans, pumpkin, etc.etc. They also made excellent bread by boiling the dough, having it first wrapped in corn leaves.\nThey also prepare a most excellent kins of food by boiling corn grits & thickening the soup. Sometimes they put in beans with the grits, and sometimes the meat of hickory or black walnuts. These ingredients render this kind of food a real luxury.\nFormerly they made great use of parched corn meal. They parched this corn by putting it into a pot with clean, sifted ashes, and setting it on the fire, stirring it constantly while over the fire. When it was sufficiently parched, they sifted out the ashes, leaving the pure corn. Meal made of this they considered not only a luxury but also a great support to nature, and used it on journies and war expeditions etc. They prepared a most delicious dish of parched cornmeal & grapes. They first boiled the grapes, and then thickened the soup with this meal, sometimes to the consistency of honey, and then ate it with wooden or Buffalo horn spoons. The ancient old Indians would not eat the sinew that shrank, because if they did, it was said, that sinew would cramp & prevent their running. They would not eat blood or any creature which died without bleeding. Some now will not eat eels or eat fish. Hawks, owls, Ravens, crows, wood cocks, Red birds etc they must not eat . They considered the Buffalo, the elk, the deer and turkey as the proper meat. \nConsidering their means, the Indian women are evidently among the best cooks in the world.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70443,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70443","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3f84038275e8564503e0fcf3f96f1877.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3f84038275e8564503e0fcf3f96f1877.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3f84038275e8564503e0fcf3f96f1877.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3f84038275e8564503e0fcf3f96f1877.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:52+00:00","modified":"2020-10-25T18:55:29+00:00","filename":"3f84038275e8564503e0fcf3f96f1877.jpg","authentication":"928ddf9578839a0a9b9b94685738818c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00047_o2.jpg","size":686524,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2215,"compression_ratio":0.057396873171139999036949319588529760949313640594482421875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052648+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052648+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052648+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3f84038275e8564503e0fcf3f96f1877.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423934,"FileSize":686524,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2215\"","Height":2215,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2215,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:35","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6716},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:26:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:26:48","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":36,"SubSecTimeDigitized":36,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2215,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Death, &c.                                        98  P.R.?

Just previous to the death of any one in a house, all the children were sent away, and none suffered to remain, generally, but the doctor & the adult relatives.\n\nIn the death of any one, the male seldom made much ado in weeping, but the females were excessive, and immediately commenced a most doleful lamentation, expressing the relative name of the deceased, as for instance, if it was a child the lamentation would be 'A que tsi, hi hi hi, i.e. my child, o, o, o, or alas alas - this was sung rather than spoken, with a very mournful tone of voice. The expressions of grief were greater or less, according to circumstances. Sometimes the mourners seemed entirely inconsolable, determined to go to the grave weeping. In each town there was a man appointed to bury the dead. This man, therefore, at a proper time, came to the house where the corpse was, and buried it. The most ancient custom was to bury the corpse in the house, directly under where the person died, except in the case of a distinguished chief, and then he was buried under the seat he had usually occupied in the council house. But when not buried in the house, the man took the corpse and carried it himself to the place of interment, followed by the adult relatives. sometimes the corpse was laid by the side of a large rock, - a wall about eighteen inches high, was then built on one side, and a covering of wood, or an arch of stones, made over, and then stones were heaped up over the body. Sometimes the corpse was laid between two junctions, - covered over and then stones heaped on: and sometimes it was buried in a grave, dug in the earth. Frequently a part, or the whole of the clothing etc of the deceased, was buried with the corpse ^ or burned at his buryal. The buryal being completed the funeral procession returned. The man who buried the corpse, entered the house alone, took out the goards & whatever furniture happened to be in the house when the person died, and carrying them away, either burnt or buried them. He then took out all the old fire, ashes & wood from the fire place, and made new fire for future use. He then took the family (after they had taken emetics) to a stream, where all plunged entirely seven times. Then putting on clean clothes, they remained in a state of separation, in some camp, being unclean four days.

She did not wash, nor seem to pay any attention to herself, but wore her clothes thrown carelessly over her.\nAmong the Creeks when a husband dies, the widow, while mourning, neither combs her hair nor anoints it, and neither? washes her face or apparel. But at the end of four months her former husbands brother, or nearest kinsman, may marry her, but no other. See farther on a future sheet.\nWith regard to ceremonial uncleanlinesses and defilements, both of males and females, we may learn there from the Bible but the manner of cleansing was, as might well be expected, in some respects different. See another sheet hereafter. \nThe ancient Cherokees, on going to bed, sung, or chanted, the following prayer, viz., Let my soul be in the first heaven, let my soul be in the second heaven, and so on , to the seventh heaven. The first heaven was supposed to be as high as the tops of the trees. The second, as high as the clouds, and so on to the seventh, which was supposed to be the place where God resides. In each of these heavens angels were supposed to be stationed, attending to the various duties assigned to them. Some doubtless repeated other kinds of prayers.\nDuring the night, even when sleeping alone they were supposed to contract, or be in danger of contracting, certain defilements, therefore the most religious , as priests &c. used to observe the following ceremonies in the morning, for their cleansing. On awakening sometimes before day, they turned onto their ?, and sung four times the following words, viz. Ki na tu hu yi, ko lu lac ti, ha tla su gu ti. They then devoted sometime to meditation, and then sung the same again and so on, till day light. Just as day light appeared, they arose and went to a stream, and standing on the bank, sang again the same words, and then plunged into the stream, and continued under water as long as they could hold their breath.

In that, the seats of the common counsellors were plain, round behind the three sacred seats, whereas behind those was holy ground, & no common person nor common counsellor could ever go.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70448,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70448","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/829dbdf086b6515fed15aa07eaf62d0b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/829dbdf086b6515fed15aa07eaf62d0b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/829dbdf086b6515fed15aa07eaf62d0b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/829dbdf086b6515fed15aa07eaf62d0b.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:56+00:00","modified":"2020-10-25T20:33:08+00:00","filename":"829dbdf086b6515fed15aa07eaf62d0b.jpg","authentication":"9bd305436a75a2ee30b9ffbd5d50196f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00052_o2.jpg","size":586331,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2212,"compression_ratio":0.04908671555823500287640825945345568470656871795654296875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052835+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052835+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052835+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"829dbdf086b6515fed15aa07eaf62d0b.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423935,"FileSize":586331,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2212\"","Height":2212,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2212,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:39","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4883},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:28:35","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:28:35","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":73,"SubSecTimeDigitized":73,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2212,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Warfare  Fourth sheet P.25   104\nOffensive wars were declared by the great war chief, or Captain of the host, and his second. These two great men, having agreed, dictated war against their enemies. The chief captain then taking a rattling gourd, walked, with his second, to the council house yard, shaking his gourd and singing with a loud voice the following word four times, viz., O gi who ne. This was a song of mourning for himself and his warriors, who were to be exposed to such iminent danger. Having done this, he raised the war whoop four times, to see if he could find any friends, (warriors) to come to his assistance. He then laid down his gourd, and took his seat. His second, or right hand man, then arose, took the gourd, and went through the same ceremonies, and sat down. All the warriors, who heard the war whoop, & were prepared for war, immediately started for the place of rendevous.\nThe second, or right hand man, requested certain warriors to select seven men to order the war. This being done, there were? selected a priest to accompany them, and immediately dispatched a messenger to give him notice of his appointment. The messenger, on his return, came into the midst of the seven counsellors, above mentioned, with instruction from the priest how to proceed in besieging a town, etc. The warriors, now enlisted, and others on enlisting, came under the special direction of the priest, selected as above. None must have any farther intercourse with their wives, or other females until their purification after the close of the war.\nThe priest made new fire (by rubbing two pieces of dry Basswood together, with a dry weed called golden rod, between them, till the weed, then the wood took fire) to be their guide and helper in the war. He called himself second to this fire, that is, the fire was the principal priest, and he was his assistant, or right hand man.  This fire he put in the sacred ark for the war &? these + arks, they had two, one kept always in the council house, and the other used for war. This for war was about a foot long, shaped some like a canoe, having a lid fitted to the upper side. All was made of clay, burnt in the same manner as Indian earthen ware. No one must touch this, but the priest for the war, or his right hand man. Next to the holy fire, the priest valued his diamond (crystalline quartz) which he called the man eater, and used only in case of war. When an enemy was killed, some of the blood of the scalp was rubbed on this stone. A little previous to commencing their march, the priest called all the warriors into the council house. Here it may be well to give a description of a council house. seven posts were set, I call these arks because, with regard to their sacredness & use, they so easily resembled the jewish ark.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70449,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70449","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/241e8933fdf52a7bb440821f2408a28f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/241e8933fdf52a7bb440821f2408a28f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/241e8933fdf52a7bb440821f2408a28f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/241e8933fdf52a7bb440821f2408a28f.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:56+00:00","modified":"2020-10-29T22:10:32+00:00","filename":"241e8933fdf52a7bb440821f2408a28f.jpg","authentication":"7eaee8eb7db3ca76e85ae22095778378","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00053_o2 copy.jpg","size":549530,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2201,"compression_ratio":0.046235717771383001706286819398883380927145481109619140625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052850+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052850+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052850+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"241e8933fdf52a7bb440821f2408a28f.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423935,"FileSize":549530,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2201\"","Height":2201,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2201,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:40","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5445},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:28:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:28:50","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":25,"SubSecTimeDigitized":25,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2201,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Deep in the ground, equi distant from each other, so as to form seven equal sides, though generally the roof, where it touches the ground is entirely round.

His mother, or sister, as the case may be, takes a new suit of clothes, goes to the widow, combs her hair, washes her, changes her dress, and take her to the Town house, and delivers her to the man who is to be her husband.

Blind savannah clan, -- the Paint clan, -- the Long hair clan, -- the Bird clan, -- the Deer clan, and the Molly clan. All of the same clan, are considered as near relations, and therefore not allowed to intermarry.\nunclear, it is said, the Cherokees seldom married a second time, as second marriages were not honorable, (unless in the case of a brothers widow, as among the Creeks)\nA priest was not allowed to marry a widow, nor a woman who had been put away by her husband, nor any other woman of a bad character.\nPolygamy, it is said, was not anciently tolerated, but one man must have only one wife.\nWhen a young man desired a virgin in marriage, he consulted her parents, whose consent was deemed absolutely essential. -- All parties being agreed, ie. the parents of the young man & young woman both, the time was appointed for the marriage, and the priest who was to officiate, was notified of their wishes. Accordingly, on the day appointed for the marriage, early in the morning, the priest got two roots, of a certain kind, and laid them on his hand, a little distance from each other. He then, with his face toward the East, prayed to be informed whether those two young persons were designed for each other; and whether, if married they would live long and happily together. If the persons were not for each other, and would not, if married, live well together, the roots would not move. If in case of marriage, they would live well together a short time, & then one die, the roots would move together, but one would quickly wilt away. In either case, the priest forbade their marriage, and nothing more was said about it. But if the roots came together, and continued so for some time, or till the priest put them down, then the marriage was to be consummated. All parties then assembled, and the priest commended the couple to god, praying that they might be enabled to live long and happily together. He then told them that if either should prove unfaithful to the other, that one especially, must go to the bad place. They supposed that nothing could break the marriage covenant, but adultery.\nIn case the bride had a brother, he and the bridegroom exchanged, clothes, & whatever else they had, and considered themselves, as of one family.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70460,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70460","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/03ba724b062b684d53adb3664b78f949.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/03ba724b062b684d53adb3664b78f949.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/03ba724b062b684d53adb3664b78f949.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/03ba724b062b684d53adb3664b78f949.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:33:05+00:00","modified":"2021-08-29T23:53:42+00:00","filename":"03ba724b062b684d53adb3664b78f949.jpg","authentication":"771041440bc6b97183e0d08517117745","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00063_o2 copy.jpg","size":516941,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2222,"compression_ratio":0.04308272493916100176480910022291936911642551422119140625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["053454+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["053454+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["053454+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"03ba724b062b684d53adb3664b78f949.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423935,"FileSize":516941,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2222\"","Height":2222,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2222,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:48","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4880},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:34:54","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:34:54","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":15,"SubSecTimeDigitized":15,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2222,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"unclear 121\nAmong the Creeks, a young woman, in the first change of circumstances, immediately separated from the rest of the family, and retired to a camp, at some distance, where she continued seven days. During this time no person might touch her, and she was particular not to touch even her food. At the end of seven days, she washed herself -- her unclear and whatever she had touched during her uncleanness, and then returned to the family: she was then, & not before, considered marriageable. If a young man fell in love with a girl before that period, he spake for her, and if her parents were willing he should have her, he then supplied her with venison &c, and she could not marry any other person, yet he could not take her as his wife till after this first separation. They then took each other for life, and if either forsook the other, that one was liable to be whipped and unclear by the women of the town.\nChildren\nCherokee women, generally, have but little difficulty in bringing forth their children. A mother, or grandmother, in unclear cases, affords all needed assistance. The presence of men is disgusting on such occasions. A priest, however, in some instances, prayed for a speedy and safe delivery. If the child at birth, happened to fall on its breast, the omen was bad, and it was wrapped up immediately, and thrown into a creek. When the cloth about it was disengaged, or unwrapped, and began to float, the child was caught up and carried back while the cloth, supposed to have taken the ill fortune, was suffered to float away. But if the child at birth fell on its back the event was ominous of good. Sometimes soon after birth the child was waved over the fire, or held before it, while a prayer was addressed to that element in its behalf.\nEither on the fourth or seventh, sometimes on one, sometimes on the other, the priest took the child to a creek or river, and commending it to its creator, prayed that it might enjoy a long and happy life and then plunged it seven times in the water, and returned it to its parents.\nParents generally, are excessively fond of their children, and indulge them to a degree which often proves their ruin, especially at the present day. Children and young people, however, used to manifest great respect for their parents and the aged generally.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70461,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70461","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3b66430226ade39e46871faecdbc5ec2.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3b66430226ade39e46871faecdbc5ec2.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3b66430226ade39e46871faecdbc5ec2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3b66430226ade39e46871faecdbc5ec2.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:33:06+00:00","modified":"2022-02-14T16:06:59+00:00","filename":"3b66430226ade39e46871faecdbc5ec2.jpg","authentication":"7ab0d8df1ca8a2cf6c211cf16fbb4960","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00064_o2.jpg","size":552778,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2215,"compression_ratio":0.04621503218794399681090823150952928699553012847900390625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["053508+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["053508+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["053508+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3b66430226ade39e46871faecdbc5ec2.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423935,"FileSize":552778,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2215\"","Height":2215,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2215,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:49","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4798},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:35:08","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:35:08","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":4,"SubSecTimeDigitized":4,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2215,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Feasts, dances, &c. 124 Unclear 126 Anciently the Cherokees commenced this year with the first new moon of spring i e. in March, but with regard to their moons, the first moon in autumn, was called, and is still, the great moon, or first moon in the year as to New moon feasts, ceremonies &c. This according to some was the September, & according to others, the October November, they reckoned their days from sun set till sun set the next day. Thus when they fasted they ate just before sun set, and abstained from food till sun set the next day; except when their eating the next day was a religious feast, preceded by a sacrifice, and in that case the sacrifice, and the commencement of eating, must be just before sunset, in order that their devotions might be paid to that planet before it disappears. The first business in the spring was to prepare their fields and plant their corn, beans &c. The time for doing this, was determined by the U ka and his privy council, in order that the fruits of the field in all parts of the nation might all crossed out come forward at the same time, & be in readiness for the feast of first fruits. But about the time of planting, or immediately after, they hold a national feast. This, in most respects was similar to the feast of first fruits, except the use of old corn instead of new. A description of that feast, therefore, will be sufficient to give a general view of both. Anciently the Cherokees lived in large towns, contiguous to each other, so that the whole nation could easily be convened. \n\n  The fruits of the field becoming fit for use, the seven counsellors of the Uka, or high priest, appointed the time for the green corn dance, or feast of first fruits, and dispatched a messenger through the nation to notify the people, and to gather seven ears of corn, from seven fields, of the seven clans, one ear from a field of each clan. This man, on his return, delivered the seven ears of corn to the seven counsellors. \n These counsellors then make all necessary arrangements, and seven days provisions to the feast, sent the men of the town on a hunting expedition, to provide meat for the feast, these continued in the woods six days, and on the evening of the sixth day returned, and the meat sent round & cooked for the feast. During the six days, the  hunters were out, the seven counsellors, (& probably their wives) kept a strict fast, eating only once in twenty-four hours i.e. about sun set.

His assistant now swept this room peculiarly clean, and then brought new fresh earth, and made an altar of earth in the middle of the room. He fixed the top of this very seriously, drew a circle around it, in which he made a fire of small pieces of bark, taken unclear from the east side of the following trees, viz, white oak, Basswood, Chestnut, Black oak, Water oak, and white pine. The fire being prepared, the priest put on it the end of the deer tongue reserved by the hunters. He also threw in the fire seven kernels of corn. These were taken from seven different ears, plucked from seven fields, the fields belonging to the seven different clans. Thus one kernel was sacrificed for each clan. While these were burning, the priest sprinkled a powder into the fire. This was made of old tobacco leaves, old tobacco, so called because used in old times. It is a weed supposed to resemble in some respects tobacco and prayed at this same time that God would bless the priests of the year, and cause them to prove healthy to the people. \n This being done, and the seats & food having been made ready and the people seated, all were directed to eat, and all commenced simultaneously, except the priest and the seven men and seven women selected to fast previous to the feast. Then continued at the town house seven days longer, eating food made of old provisions. The whole town assembled again, had another feast and dance, when all partook together of the green fruit, and closed the ceremony. Families which could not attend a general meeting, as above, before tasting their first fruits, sent for a priest, to visit them. He took tome of their new fruit, provided, in the palm of his hand, and some grains of the same on his fingers.

This being done the women and children might partake of the new fruits. The women, not being permitted to enter the sacred square, sent boys to get the new fire, and take to them. The women stood at a distance, received the new fire, and were then admonished by the priest to take the new fire to their house, and feed it with sound wood of seven kinds of trees (the same with which it was first kindled) and to keep it burning with those kinds of wood four days, not suffering it to go out. He also gave them various other instructions. After four days, they might burn any kind of wood they pleased. This direction was strictly obeyed..., But women, being in any of their uncleanness could not cook nor warm by the new fire, nor partake of the green fruit, but used their old fire & old food out in the woods or in a tent for their purpose till the time of their separation was evident.

These carried each in her hand a fan made of swan's feathers, and had a certain picture fastened on her head. The women danced in a place by themselves, and the two men appointed to sing for them, were seated on a bench near them. The men danced in their sacred square, where no woman nor child must come. Each man carried in his right hand a birch or stick with swan's feathers tied to the end. This he held up when dancing thus giving the whole company a beautiful appearance. These switches were doubtless designed for the same purpose as the white pine boughs among the Cherokees, (and many will not suppose they had the same origin as the lulebs* among other Jews.)

The men then repaired to a river and washed. They then returned and ate of old fruit, having fasted all day, except as they drank of the water above mentioned or the Black drink, which was more of the Button snake root. They then spent the night in dancing. This fast they continued thus four days. During this time they must not go to their houses, nor have any intercourse with their wives. Each day was spent in dancing, and drinking the purifying water and Black drink, till near night, when they repaired to the water, - washed, - returned & partook of food of old corn, and again spent the night in dancing. Thus, they not only denied themselves of food during the day, but also of sleep during the night, for four nights successively. On the morning of the fourth night of the fast and the fifth of the festival, the women brought new corn & cooked, and went down near the sacred square. The men then, for the last time repaired to the water and washed. Being now considered clean from all past impurities, they partook of new fruit, and the feast closed.\n\n  The Natchez Indians used to observe the feast of first fruits as follows. Anciently they had no corn, but a certain kind of rye,  which got ripe in June. In that month therefore they celebrated this feast. The official name of their priest signified one who prays. He appointed the time for the feast, and sent a messenger to notify the people and direct them to bring their first fruits on the morning of the seventh day. At the time appointed all assembled at the council house. The rye was put into six large wooden vessels provided for the purpose, and these were filled with water. Cane leaves were also put in with the rye. The priest then prayed; and as he ceased all the people gave thanks to God. He again prayed, and again the people gave thanks.

This has latterly  been observed at different seasons of the year, though it was anciently kept it is said at a stated season sometime during the first moon of autumn. In this dance , the men and women unite, two men abreast  followed by two women, then two men &c, till all are arranged. The two forward men carry in their right hands something like a hoop, with two sticks put through it, crossing each other at right angles in the center. On the ends of these sticks are fastened white feathers. Two men in the middle, and two in the rear carry the unknown, while all the others men and women hold in their right hands green, white pine boughs, or branches. On the three first nights they dance till about midnight, and at the close of the dance each night they put away their boughs till the next morning, and retire to their homes as they choose.\n\n  But on the fourth night a little after dark, victuals having been prepared, is brought to the town house, or place of the dance, and all partake together in a joyful feast and then commence the same dance as on the three preceding nights, and continue it till nearly or quite day. \n  On the three first nights, previous to dancing, a certain man appointed for the purpose, holds a  box, and commences singing, when each person present throws a piece of tobacco into the box. On the fourth night, near the close of the dance, this man carries the box round the inside, singing in hu ni tu tu, a ne hu le ya. This he sings four times, and each person takes out of the box a piece of tobacco, and then takes some of the pine leaves from the bough, and mashing them in the hand puts them with the tobacco. This being done, all standing in a circle round the fire, each one, singly, walks toward, the fire, reaching forth his or her hand, as if to throw the tobacco into the fire, singing u, u, u (as long as) and then suddenly starts back as if reluctant to part with the tobacco, but on approaching the fire the third time throws the tobacco and pine leaves together into the fire, and retires.  And thus the feast closes.\n  Cherokees are not addicted to covetousness. They are trained up to hospitality, strangers and visitors must share the best they have; and those of their own people who are poor and have no home, must find a home in every house where they may chance to be, having a claim not merely on their pity, but the position of those unable to relieve them, and use imperative made with as much kindness as those credited when calling for his just due.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70468,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70468","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/16ae3e490bd415028da122a29b8d57f7.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/16ae3e490bd415028da122a29b8d57f7.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/16ae3e490bd415028da122a29b8d57f7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/16ae3e490bd415028da122a29b8d57f7.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:33:11+00:00","modified":"2022-02-15T15:56:00+00:00","filename":"16ae3e490bd415028da122a29b8d57f7.jpg","authentication":"3957e42f6549131298aed15737618f78","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00071_o2 copy.jpg","size":553008,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2211,"compression_ratio":0.046317905422383003066766349320459994487464427947998046875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["053721+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["053721+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["053721+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"16ae3e490bd415028da122a29b8d57f7.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423935,"FileSize":553008,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2211\"","Height":2211,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2211,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:55","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5631},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:37:21","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:37:21","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":87,"SubSecTimeDigitized":87,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2211,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"135  p. 42  137                    New Moons.\nto respected new moons, the Cherokee women end their year with the first autumnal Moon.

At the first appearance of that moon, the people of each Town assembled at the house of the priest, who was on this occasion attended by two right hand men, subject to his orders. One of these assistants selected seven men sing for the women, who soon commenced their dance. The first singer, taking his seat, and commencing his music, The women began Their dance, which consisted of a slow walk around the fire. The foremost had a tarapin shell,  filled with pebles tied to her leg. The calf of her leg, (This has probably been introduced in modern times instead of the small bells women anciently, about The ankles.) \nThe first singer continued his music about there quarters of a hour, and then retired, and the women took their seats, and rested a short, till the second musician commanded. This dance continued till the seven singers had performed each his part, and then all retired to nest. \nIn the morning before sun rise, the priest collected all, men women and children into a house for the purpose and seated them in rows with their faces toward the east. He then opened a crack in the east side of the house, and set his diamond Crystalline quartz in the crack so that the sun when it rose would shine upon it, He then stood back about four feet, looking at the stone, with his face toward the sun, to which he addressed a prayer.

Now, if there was one in assembly to die before The return of another quarterly new moon, i.e. within three months, this light would pass without touching them. My informant says he has seen this himself, and has known several instanced, when this brightens did not touch particular persons, and those persons all died in less than three months from this time They were thus pointed out as the victims of death. During the time the priest did not touch the diamond, but simply stood repeating his prayers, The priest then put away his diamond, and all the people went out, The women to cooking, and the men to

During the time this was going on, the priest retired alone to a mountain to sing and pray. On his return, as soon as he could determine that it was a little past noon, (which he did by means of a perpendicular stake) he again collected the people into the house, placing them, standing in rows, with their faces toward the east. He then prayed with them, but in so low a tone as not to be word scratched out understood. Two deer skins, one of a buck, and the other of a doe, were then spread on the table, with the flesh side up. The priest then took a piece of new cloth, such as had been given for the occasion, and unclear, put it on the deer skins. He then laid on the buck skin seven strands of beads, about six inches long, one for each clan. Then all the women in the house, having each a string about six inches long with three beads on it, one red, one white, & one black, wet the beads with spittle and put them on the doe skin. Lined out: The skins were then folded, so that the hair only would be seen. The males also did the same, putting theirs on the buck skin. The skins were then folded, so that the hair only would be seen. The two right hand men then took the deer skins, then the people all left the house, going directly to the stream. No one must look behind or to the right or left, just his eyes directly forward, till being out of the house, then the right hand men followed with the deer skins, while the priest made up the rear.\n\n On arriving at the river (or creek) the people must not look about them, as usual, but still keep their eyes on the water. \n The two right hand men went to the table prepared for the purpose, unfolded and spread their deer skins on it, as they had been spread at the house. They also unfolded the cloth, exposing the beads to full view. The strings with three beads each were then placed according age, i.e. a cloth being spread on each deer skin, string for the oldest man, or men, first, on the buckskin, then for the next aged etc. and so for the females on the doe skin. The right hand men then got a great number of sticks, about six inches long, -- put one end to the edge of the water -- measured the length back, and then stuck them in the sand, short distances from each other, along the shore or bank, as far as word scratched out was occupied by the people, when seated near each other.

Now if at any time the ground became dry and parched, or when the people began to desire right hand men, appointed seven men to hunt seven days and also seven men and seven women to fast the same length of time, as before the feast of first fruits. At the expiration of those days, when the hunters returned, the people again assembled, and a man was selected to take the deer skins the hunters had brought, and the end of the tongue of a deer for sacrifice to the priest\nrequesting him to obtain rain?. This man was to continue with the priest during the process. Sacrifice offered, prayers &c addressed to all who were supposed to have any\nagency in causing rain? &c.   The seven men and women appointed to fast, continued in the town house (having victuals brought to them, after the expiration of the seven\nfast days). Then the town assembled and held an all night dance, as words crossed out expression of gratitude.\n\nWhen the weather was supposed to be too cold, the people assembled at the town house. The two right hand men of the priest, then selected seven men to gather seven large\n\nbundles of sticks, one of peach, one of plum, one of mulberry, one of Locust, one of Black jack, one of grape vine and one of whortleberry (a large kind)  The sticks being brought, the priest made a fire of them, and offered, as a burnt offering a tarapin shell, filled with tobacco, praying at the same time for warm weather.\n\nBut in case the weather was too warm a burnt offering of spanish oak, & ivy leaves was made.

The practice of medicine\nbecomes intimately connected with the office of priests or conjurers. Consequently we find that administering medecine, either to cure, or prevent diseases, is always\nconnected with charms, incantations &c. or with sacrifices, prayers, various acts of devotion. The charms sung, or whispered by the doctor in case of common diseases\nI will omit to repeat. They are all directed to different objects or creatures, or supposed spiritual beings under the names of creatures with which they were acquainted.  But\nin case of snake bite, the doctor seats the patient on a log if in the wilderness, - puts a certain root in his mouth, - prepares his other remedy, and then walks round him singing\na prayer to the following effect, \"Now I begin. Thou white man above hast promised to hear. Thou hast made this snakes teeth, which have bitten this man. Let them be vain in \nthis case, and let him get well. What thou hast done (made) and the remedy I administer agree. Therefore let the man speedily recover.

He then raised them high, but slowly, praying (as for himself when going to sleep) that the Lord would take this man's spirit to the first - second - third - fourth - fifth - sixth & seventh heaven; and then, letting his hand fall he prayed that the mans spirit might be let down to the sixth, - fifth - fourth - third - second - first heaven to  him, that thus he might live long on the earth. Then, in  case the man was to live long, the priest said to him, \"Your life is good.\" and ordered him to go to a stream and dip himself all over, seven times.     But in case the priest could not for the present assure him of long life, he ordered him to get something for sacrifice.

On touching any person therefore she occasioned those find pimples which first appeared in that disease. The male was s aid to be the colour of poke\nberries when ripe, and by giving the person another touch occasioned that black eye appearance of the pustiles when about to mortify.   These people, it was said never slept except for a short time about midnight. Therefore when any would flee from them they must start at that time, and afterward should they want ?hrovision?, or anything from their houses, they must return at that time of night, observing the most profound stillness. And as these people always walked in the large, plain paths, the Cherokees, in avoiding them walked out of the road in the woods.  None, however, must talk against them, nor seem to be afraid of them. When these strange beings were supposed to be in the vicinity, the people of the town assembled, and selected seven men, one out of each clan to make arrangements for the necessary ceremonies to keep them away.\n\nThese men first chose a priest to officiate on the occasion, sent one of their number to give him notice.   The priest then commenced gathering his medicine, which must consist of at least seven kinds of herbs & roots. He prayed as he got them that they might be blessed so as to effect what was desired.\n On the fourth night, a little before sunset the priest took his medicinal herbs and roots to the town house. New fire had already been made. This was done as follows, viz. \n\nThen who had been appointed, got two pieces of dry Basswood, put goldenrod seed between them, and two commenced rubbing these sticks together, and continued till fatigued. They were then relieved by two others, and so on till the wood caught fire.    They then got dry pieces of wood from the east side of Basswood trees, examined to see that there were no worms in it, took off what might be rotten, and then kindled the fire with the remainder, being pure & free from rot.

The hymn, yo wa, is not now understood by any of the Cherokees. It is probably expressed in what is termed the old language. Many now living remember the last of their people who spake that language.

But respecting the old language I have never been able to obtain much information more than to know a few individual words. \n\nThere is one word in the above song worthey of notice viz. Ani tsu si, in the 5th line or verse. The old man who only had this hymn, knew nothing of the meaning of it, nor of the jews: and the young man who translated the word jews as found in the Bible, knew nothing of this word in the above hymn, yet in translating they rendered jews into Cherokee by the word Ani tsu si, exactly the same word found in the above hymn. \n\nNote. 3. In reading to Maj. Lowrey certain traditions respecting the journey through the wilderness &c. he was ready to suspect that our good friends, had received from certain Quakers, (long ago in the nation) indirectly, and without knowing whence it came, some of the information they had communicated. yet his findings did not lessen, to any considerable degree, my confidence in the traditions. Because in the first place, Maj. Lowrey began, evidently, to be a little suspicious that any evidence of their being jews, would militate against their continuance in this country. And second, I cannot suspect the veracity of the men who gave me those traditions, as having been certainly handed down from their fathers.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70482,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70482","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/772920c3f4f584d3c34d0c40995b4143.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/772920c3f4f584d3c34d0c40995b4143.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/772920c3f4f584d3c34d0c40995b4143.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/772920c3f4f584d3c34d0c40995b4143.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:33:22+00:00","modified":"2022-02-22T19:18:11+00:00","filename":"772920c3f4f584d3c34d0c40995b4143.jpg","authentication":"0ae0f620e7af8d078083b8c5de80f4f8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00085_o2 copy.jpg","size":461045,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2188,"compression_ratio":0.039021345385604998268203047473434708081185817718505859375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["231018+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["231018+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["231018+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"772920c3f4f584d3c34d0c40995b4143.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423936,"FileSize":461045,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2188\"","Height":2188,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2188,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:09:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4113},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 23:10:18","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 23:10:18","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":74,"SubSecTimeDigitized":74,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2188,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"163      165\nBrainerd  Jan 21 1837\nMr John Howard Payne, New York\n\n Dear Sir, Permit me with fraternal confidence to submit the preceeding communications for your personal perusal.

What I have communicated, is what I have received from the Cherokees, and what, I believe, they communicated sincerely. But should we examine the whole again, we should doubtless find many errors, and imperfections. Having had no written language, it may well be supposed that many of their antiquities are lost, and many are handed down connected with some degree of error. Some of the old men remember some things, and others again delight to retain, and ruminate on other parts of their history. It is therefore with much difficulty that we can illicit anything like a connected history of their antiquities. And notwithstanding all this difficulty, yet we must expect to find the first edition of any work on Indian antiquities, in many respects incorrect, and imperfect. But by means of an imperfect edition, we might prepare one more complete, if the public mind would allow. But in the United states, with regard to Indians, and Indian affairs, the public mind is inexorable. Let a work, therefore, be ever so correct & complete, yet if it is impartial, treating the Indians with strict justice, it will not be popular. How then would we hope for forgiveness in publishing what must of necessity be more or less incorrect. On learning lately from a press in N. York City that the Indians \"are characterized by war, revenge and blood, without natural affection\", &c.  I at once concluded that all further attempts to give an impartial view of the Indians to citizens of the U. States, would be vain. Enough has been said to convince such as will be convinced. But the great mass of the people, evidently, will not be enlightened. When the Indian character is held up impartially for a moment, they will instantly dip their arrows in gall, and pierce the hand which holds it, and blacken the picture with the venom of asps, and there prevent it as exactly representing the Blood thirsty savage.

The company were then engaged in dancing till near night, when they again\npartook of their new food, as before.\n\nSoon after dark all fell prostrate and continued silent while the priest offered up a prayer. This being closed, all slept till day break, when the seven directors called them all to rise & pray. Each one called those of his own clan. Each clan now, kept separate.

This difficulty arises partly, at least, from the following circumstances.\nFirst, they are known to but few among themselves. The mass of the people are entirely ignorant of them, not only of the youth & middle aged but even among the aged but few can be found instructed in the learning of the ancients. \nSecond, those who have the knowledge requisite have received this knowledge as a sacred deposit and would rather die than betray their trust, by making known this sacred knowledge in an improper manner or to persons not worthy to receive it.\nThird, some of their ancient customs were not to be made known to any except sons designed for, and trained up for sacred offices, on pain of death, to be inflicted by the invisible powers above.

The Indians are almost unbounded in their desire to please their fellows, and their own people generally. They study and practice among themselves the rules of native politeness to an unexampled degree. Therefore you cannot by any means persuade an Indian, not influenced by the christian religion, to say anything which will tend to render him unpopular among his people.\n\nAnd suppose he commences conversation on most important subjects, yet on perceiving a sneer or look of contempt, his mouth is perfectly closed, and all attempts afterwards to open it are vain.\nFifth. Indians not only hate white men in contempt but consider them irreligious, unprincipled & cruel; and therefore all intimate connection with them is interdicted by common consent, and is unpopular.   Of course a white man must be clothed with extraordinary credentials indeed, who would not be himself a a reproach among the Indians, and a disgrace to such as he might gain over to his friendship.  True Indians of dissipated habits, will associate with white men of the same character in order to obtain a portion of the\n\ninebriating cup, yet in their sober moments hold them in contempt.\n\nSixth.  There is yet another difficulty arising not only from the disposition of Indians to tantalize but also from the principle that they are not bound always to tell the truth to white men. Of course the narrator may invent his own story as he proceeds, offering it to his inquisitive white guest, as among their important antiquities.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70495,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70495","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e873e9820190b861b0813e873be221a8.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e873e9820190b861b0813e873be221a8.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e873e9820190b861b0813e873be221a8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e873e9820190b861b0813e873be221a8.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:33:33+00:00","modified":"2022-02-26T21:00:08+00:00","filename":"e873e9820190b861b0813e873be221a8.jpg","authentication":"4c79f27023740763a5f421337e0064f5","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL003_00003_o2.jpg","size":1607032,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2847,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.052265282493593002988152562693358049727976322174072265625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["114722+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["114722+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["114722+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e873e9820190b861b0813e873be221a8.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423936,"FileSize":1607032,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2847\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2847,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Windows","DateTime":"2013:01:14 08:23:03","Exif_IFD_Pointer":150},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 11:47:22","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 11:47:22","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":41,"SubSecTimeDigitized":41,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2302,"ExifImageLength":2910,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"There is yet another reason why no important information is ever obtained by white men from Indians relative to their antiquities. It is this, people are slow to believe what they do not wish to be true. Now almost all United States citizens, missionaries as well as others, have a most degraded opinion of the Indians: and when they solicit information concerning them, it is to establish this opinion. Thus, for instance, one enquires of some ignoramus what the [unknown] Indians used to say about Noah's flood. The reply, perhaps is that on a certain occasion when all the people were assembled at an all night dance, a dog commenced howling in a most astonishing manner, and when his master commanded silence, this dog spoke and told him the cause of his distress, viz. that the world was to be drowned. Now, on hearing this the inquisitive mind is satisfied, and ever after when the subject of Indian antiquities is introduced, the above story is brought forward with a sarcastic laugh, in order to put to the blush every one who would speak honorably of the ancient Indians. I need not say that such persons may spend all their days among the Indians and yet die as ignorant of their true character, almost as if they had never been born. There are others who live among the Indians too indifferent to make enquiries; and, to excuse this indifference, will readily assert that there is nothing relative to Indian antiquities worthy of investigation, when the fact is, if there had been ten thousand diamonds, shaded by the least possible obscurity their sluggish minds would never have discovered them. Of course should such persons intrude their remarks on any subject of Indian antiquities\n\n Now, Sir, with regard to the character of the information I may have given relative to the Cherokees I must have you to judge. It was obtained after a residence of about twenty years in the nation, and a general acquaintance with the people. In order to allay any suspicions that might arise, I sometimes need a confirmation from W Hicks one of their beloved chiefs. Finding the aged antiquarians still rather retired, I requested a letter from Mr Ross one of their most beloved chiefs, eliciting such information as I requested. This letter, together with that of Hon. Charles R. Hicks, I submit to your perusal & direction through the written and verbal [advice?] of those chiefs I have doubtless enabled to obtain much information which otherwise must have remained a secret with themselves.

Cherokee of good character, is willing to be considered your informant with regard to the traditions which Mr. Butrick has sent you. And among those already forwarded to you, he would have you insert the three following viz. \n1st There existed from eternity, three beings, above, who were always one in mind, and in all their works. They created all things, are allways present with all their works, know all things, and direct when & how all are to die. -\n2nd The most Sacred Name of God is yi ho wa, a name which no common person was ever allowed to speak, nor any one only on certain occasions. The hymn called yowa, is sung to yi ho wa --. \n3rd The world was created with the fruit ripe, at the commencement of the first autumnal New Moon, which is therefore called the great moon, and begins the year as far as respects all the feasts of New Moon. But with the first new moon in the Spring the fruits begin to come forward, therefore that moon begins the year with regard to the feast of first fruits. Mr Sanders has interpreted for Mr. Butrick so that through him all these traditions have been communicated. And he fully believed they have not been received from whitemen for the following reasons. viz. 1st. The Antiquarians who relate them are men of integrity, and universally declare that they were handed down from their fathers. 2ed. The persons familiar with the above & other traditions & antiquities, are generally such as have been from their childhood, most entirely secluded from the whites, having no direct communication with them. 3rd.

Brainerd July 11 1807\nN. York\nDear Sir.\nIt was my intention to have submitted the result of my enquiries on Cherokee antiquities to Messrs. Ross and Lowrey for their examination, that they might have gone out with the attestation of [unknown]. But the Political labours of Mr. Ross, and the [unknown] state of the nation, have prevented. Whether you will, sir, even be disposed to make any use of these sheets I have sent you, or whether they are worthy of notice, is not for me to say. Yet is has occurred to me, that information of this kind, would not appear well, as coming from a white man, not personally acquainted with the antiquities of the nation. As your humble servant, behind the curtain, I rejoice to serve you, in eliciting all the information possible respecting the Indians, and by forwarding this to you, with the names of such Cherokees as give me the information, and are willing to take the place of informants.  \n\n Andrew Sanders, whom the Cherokees call, snake, is half Indian, his mother being a full Cherokee. His moral character is good. He has long been a member of the Presbyterian church. As he has been my interpreter for two or three years past, he has himself become quite an antiquarian. Thomas Smith, is, I believe, one quarter white. His great grandfather, a full Indian, of great age, was a very noted antiquarian, and his knowledge has been preserved in the family. blurred - Smith's Indian name is shield eater (shields were some Smith blurred of the thick skin from a Buffalo's forehead.)\n\nsnake?, or Noo cha wi, is a full Cherokee. He was once a right hand man of one of the old priests. On hearing the gospel, a few years ago, he became a convert to the christian religion, and has since been an uncommonly exemplary christian.\nJohnson Pridget, is, I think, about one eighth white, though he is unknown shows any white blood.\nThe above men I have consulted on the subject, and they are willing to be considered your authors, and that reference should be made to their names, as stated in the foregoing communications of Mssrs. Ross & Blunt.\nThere is also another Indian by the name of Noo cha wi, supposed to be near a hundred years old, a very intelligent, and most upright man in all his deportment; yet one who has generally secluded himself from all intercourse with the whites. As soon as I can see him again, by his consent, I shall be pleased in favouring you with his name, and information respecting his particular communications. By leave of Divine Providence, I will forward to you, sir, one communication more, and cease, leaving it for you to make any further enquiries, or command any other assistance","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70507,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70507","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d3099b7e2569a28879fc2a6be1b8b734.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d3099b7e2569a28879fc2a6be1b8b734.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d3099b7e2569a28879fc2a6be1b8b734.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d3099b7e2569a28879fc2a6be1b8b734.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:33:45+00:00","modified":"2022-02-16T21:05:48+00:00","filename":"d3099b7e2569a28879fc2a6be1b8b734.jpg","authentication":"04361212f3bd9e1e57ea1366d5839d86","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL006_00004_o2 copy.jpg","size":538250,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2660,"compression_ratio":0.037472152603731996578506624473448027856647968292236328125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["072259+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["072259+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["072259+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120621"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d3099b7e2569a28879fc2a6be1b8b734.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423936,"FileSize":538250,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2660\"","Height":2660,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2660,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:09:20","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":2898},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:21 07:22:59","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:21 07:22:59","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":86,"SubSecTimeDigitized":86,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2660,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"necessary for the accomplishment of your work.

It appears that some parents devoted their infant sons to the life of hunters, or rather to the service of priests with hunters. But generally young men devoted themselves to a hunters life. In this case they made their purpose known to a priest for hunters, whose business it was to train young men for hunting. Suppose this was between March and September, then on the first appearance of the new moon in September the priest gave his pupil a purifying drink, which cleansed them internally by puking them, and externally by being washed with it. He then ordered them to a river, where after praying with them he bid them plunge s even times as in common cases of purifying. He then gave them directions to hunt and the first buck they killed was for sacrifice, i.e. the tongue. This being taken and preserved as usual was taken to the priest, who then offered a sacrifice for them. The same ceremonies were gone through also at the first appearance of the new moon in March. \n Having thus initiated the pupils must keep entirely separate from women four years, and at the first appearance of the new moon in September and March, they went through the same ceremonies as mentioned above.\nAt the end of the four years the priest prepared a place for sweating them. This was made by bending sticks and putting both ends in the ground and covering them with skins or blankets, making a tent so as to resemble an umbrella set open on the ground.   This had the same name as a hot house, crowded his pupils into this tent, put hot stones in the midst, and poured water on them, and by means of the steam sweat his pupils very profusely. This tent being on the beach of a river, when the young men were in a profuse sweat, the priest ordered them into the river, where they plunged in the usual form seven times.   On coming out of the river, the priest after consulting his U lu sa ta or Divining Stone,\n\ngave them permission to marry if they saw fit, only on all hunting expeditions they were not to intercours with women.

He gave them the same kind of purifying drink, as is mentioned above. With this they washed their bodies and cleaned stomachs. This water they used for three days, and fasted each day till after noon. The priest then prepared a place for sweating as mentioned above and when in a profuse sweat, ordered them to plunge as above, seven times. Then on coming out of the water he sometimes consulted his U lu sa ta, sometimes, however, the company was at first ordered to fast one whole day, and toward night take the above purifying drink. They were then put into the warm bath, or hot house, and sweat, and then ordered to plunge suddenly into the river. On coming out of the water, they might if they chose sleep, but must have no more intercourse with women to the close of the expedition in March, even in case their families should accompany. At daybreak the next morning, the priest took them all to the river again, where they plunged as before seven times.\nThe priest then fixed a stool on the bank of the river, folded seven deer skins (dressed) and put on it and then set his U la sa ta or Divining Stone on them and prayed.  Now if they were to be successful in hunting, a great multitude of deer horns would appear in the stone; but if not, only a few or none would be seen.\nThen all started, and for seven days, every morning and evening, all must bathe as before, plunging seven times.  On commencing the hunt new fire was made, and that fire only must be used till they return, and during the whole time, at every appearance of a new moon, all must bathe as before plunging seven times.

That in these views they resemble the doctrines of the jews we need not say.\n\nThe Cherokees agree with Josephus in saying that before the flood, there was a prediction that the world should be destroyed by water and by fire.   The Indians also agree with jews, or at least with Divines generally, that the water gushed out of the ground, at the time of the flood, as well as some down from the clouds.  The Indians agree with the jews in saying that the world was created with the fruits all ripe, and that therefore the first new moon in the fall begins the year. And yet that one kind of year, by which the time for the \n\nfeast of green fruits is determined begins in March.\n\nThe Cherokees and jewish antiquarians agree in saying that in passing through the wilderness, not only the tribes, but also the clans kept distinct in their marches and encampments.   There is also the same agreement with regard to the reason why the law given in the wilderness was written on stone viz. because the first commandment being left to be handed orally had been lost.    The jews say that God on the mountain commanded them to repeat their phylactery sentences at day light & at night, and the Indians say that when on the mountain, soon after giving the land, God directed them to repeat at day break and at night the prayer they sing at those seasons.  Josephus says that Aaron was made priest on amount of his virtue; and the Cherokees say that their first great priest was chosen of God for his piety & for that reason the priesthood was to continue in his\n\nfamily.   The jewish and Indian priests had both the yellow and the white dress. They must bathe all over before putting on their priestly garments, and must wash their hands before offering a sacrifice - Their wives in both nations must be not only virgins, but women of unblemished character.\n\nWhat we render a witch, according to our ideas of witchcraft, Josephus and the Indians understand of a poisoner, or one who attempts by secret and unlawful drugs

continued the same.\n\nAccording to Maimonedes all the forty eight cities of the priests and Levites were cities of refuge: so among the Indians the habitation of every priest was a refuge to the\n\nmain? slayer;\n\n Both among the Indians & jews, if I mistake not, cities of refuge were free for strangers, and captives as well as for any of the tribe who should visit them.\nAmong the jews, I think, the winter months were holy, and so, with the Cherokees are December and January\nWith the jews espousals were considered a sufficient foundation for affinity  Josephus vol. 1. p. 497.  So also among the Creek Indians when a father has promised his\n\ndaughter in marriage, the promisee becomes to all intents his son in law.\n\nIn a comparison of Indian with jewish customs respecting warfare, mourning, religious feasts &c. we find a very astonishing resemblance, and cannot well believe that they\n\nhave been taught any of these things by the whites.\n\nAmong the Creek Indians when a person dies, the eyes are closed as among the jews by the nearest relative, the body is washed all over with water of purification; and after the burial, a priest cleanses the house, taking out everything, making new fire - sprinkling it with the water of purification, and then cleansing it with the smoke of cedar boughs.\nAll the relatives who were in the house being unclean, are purified by drinking and washing with the above water, bathing, i.e. plunging seven times, putting on entirely clean clothes &c &c. and still continue in their uncleanness seven days, purifying themselves, if pr?llent? nightly?, on the third day & on the seventh day.\nAll the Indians, as far as I know, almost exactly imitate the jews in mourning, - speaking the relative name of the deceased, adding a note of sorrow & repeating it as long as they can hold their breath, & then after a moments pause go through the name again & again. Also in their appearance they can s?ly be distinguished from the jews. They dishevel their hea?, & sometimes tear their flesh, let their clothes go unnoticed, neglect all care of their hands, face &c & if widows bereaved of husbands, remain single for four months & then the deceased husbands brother may take her &c otherwise she remains being single &c.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70514,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70514","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b7dbb3830f2140a3eba0e2166cb3f329.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b7dbb3830f2140a3eba0e2166cb3f329.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b7dbb3830f2140a3eba0e2166cb3f329.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b7dbb3830f2140a3eba0e2166cb3f329.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:33:50+00:00","modified":"2022-02-16T22:17:42+00:00","filename":"b7dbb3830f2140a3eba0e2166cb3f329.jpg","authentication":"d85573af5d873a2ec0dcf4c90cd9a7a3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL008_00009_o2 copy.jpg","size":621039,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2205,"compression_ratio":0.052157470395566001009068912708244170062243938446044921875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["233137+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["233137+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["233137+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b7dbb3830f2140a3eba0e2166cb3f329.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423937,"FileSize":621039,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2205\"","Height":2205,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2205,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:09:26","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":814,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6467},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 23:31:37","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 23:31:37","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":72,"SubSecTimeDigitized":72,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2205,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"145\n\nAnciently there was a custom of cementing perpetual friendship. Suppose two young men conceived a peculiar fondness for each other, and desired to enter into the strongest bonds of perpetual friendship, they mutually agreed to unite their hearts at the next medicine feast or feast of purification, when the Yowa was sung, sometime during that feast, at a convenient time, when all were seated solemnly in the council house, these two young friends arose, walked into the middle of the house, and commenced dancing the friendship dance round the fire, each having on his best suit of clothes, while thus dancing in the presence of all the people, they gave each other one garment after another, till each had given the other his entire dress, even legings, mocasins &c, and thus each of them publicly received, The other as himself, and became pledged to regard and trust him as himself, which he ?lind?\n\nsometimes a young man and young woman contracted this friendship.

They also commenced, as far as I can determine, the practice of pulling out their hair ^at the age of unclear^ about the same period. That is, a ring round the head about two inches wide, leaving a tuft on the crown, and some also below the ring. This they pulled so constantly that at length it refused to grow and the shave on the head appeared as if no hair had ever been on it. In the same way they made themselves appear beardless.\n\nBut the Indians, or red people of this continent are evidently one race of people. This, I presume, no one will doubt, who is in the least acquainted with them. Therefore it is evident, I think, that the Indians are as far from being beardless, as any other race of men whatever.\nP.S  Mr A Sanders Mr Butricks interpreter whose mother is a full Cherokee, says the above statements are correct & though between 40 & 50 years old says he never found a Cherokee without a beard unless he had pulled it out\n                A.E. Blunt\n\nThe Indians say that red is the most perfect and complete colour, and glory in it as distinguishing them from other people, and showing them to be the direct and unadulterated descendants from the the first man, who, they say was red, made of red earth. This is correct. And if the Indians are the only red people, then it is a fact that they are the only people resembling, in complexion, our first parents. But the jews claim to be the direct descendents from Adam, which claim is substantiated by scripture genealogy. But just as far as they resemble Adam, in complexion they are red. The question then arises why the jews are not red? The reason why Judah & Benjamin are not red is obvious. They have to a great extent, amalgamated with other nations. \"one hundred and twenty nine years before Christ John Hyreanus having conquered the Edomites, or Idumeans, reduced them to this necessity, either to embrace the jewish religion, or else leave their country, whereon choosing rather to leave their idolatry than their country, they all became proselytes to the jewish religion; and hereon living incorporated into the jewish nation, as well as into the jewish church, they thenceforth became reputed as one and the same","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70519,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70519","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/923c40ece67f2e90ade729f6fcf211c9.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/923c40ece67f2e90ade729f6fcf211c9.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/923c40ece67f2e90ade729f6fcf211c9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/923c40ece67f2e90ade729f6fcf211c9.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:33:54+00:00","modified":"2022-02-17T16:06:28+00:00","filename":"923c40ece67f2e90ade729f6fcf211c9.jpg","authentication":"5c1ece040a7f81d6de22d7e9ccd38770","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL008_00015_o2.jpg","size":649292,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2137,"compression_ratio":0.056265446541535001079292754866401082836091518402099609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["233319+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["233319+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["233319+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"923c40ece67f2e90ade729f6fcf211c9.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423937,"FileSize":649292,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2137\"","Height":2137,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2137,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:09:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":814,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6930},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 23:33:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 23:33:19","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":90,"SubSecTimeDigitized":90,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2137,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"207?\npeople. and although the name of Edomites, or Idumeans, being swallowed up in that of jews, it became wholly lost, and no more heard of. This abolition of their name happened about the end of the first century after Christ.\" (Prideaux's connexion)\n\"One hundred and six years before Christ, Aristobulus, making war upon the Itumeans [sic: Idumeans], subdued the greatest part of them, and forced them to become proselytes to the jewish religion, as Hyreanus had the Idumeans.\" (Prideaux's Connexion Vol. unclear.S.B.)\nThus we find two whole nations amalgamated with those two tribes, beside all the individual proselytes whom the Pharisees, in their zeal,  gathered into their nation. The complexion, therefore, and featurs of European jews can form no nitesion? by which to decide whether the Indians are Israelites or not. But it will be considered that though the Indians all claim to be red, yet their complexion, in different climates, and under different circumstances, appears very differently. In the South, some are so dark, that if they did not class themselves among the red people, we should not. Some again have a yellow complexion, discovering to the view of others, nothing of the red. Among Northern tribes, many are too light to be classed among red men, were it not for their determination to be so.\n\n But after all that may be said of the difference between European jews & Indians, yet, if I mistake not, William Penn when surrounded by Indians in Pennsylvania, seemed to imagine himself in the midst of a company of jews, the resemblance was so great. (Please examine. I have not his works) \nWith regard to the sabbath it was a sign between God & his people. When they revered his name, they kept his sabbaths, but when they apostatized from him, they disregarded the sabbath. As a nation, the ten tribes were apostates from the commencement of Jeroboam's reign. And their disregarding the sabbath was it appears one great reason why they were driven from their own country. From worshiping the calves of Jeroboam, they turned to worshiping the sun and moon, and when scattered among the medes and Persians would naturally imbibe their ideas respecting fire. All this idolatry, with individual exceptions, the Indians evidently still retain. And while they continue in the same apostasy which first caused them to disregard the sabbath, we cannot suppose they will return to their former observance of that day.\nYet, would it not seem that the seventh day has been a peculiar day to the Indians? Their feasts on almost all important occasions are continued seven days; and at their national festivals how many of the most important transactions occur the seventh day? That is the general day for their most important and sacred duties.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70520,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70520","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ef29acae5b3feced68a356bdb586216f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ef29acae5b3feced68a356bdb586216f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ef29acae5b3feced68a356bdb586216f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ef29acae5b3feced68a356bdb586216f.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:33:55+00:00","modified":"2022-04-03T17:42:13+00:00","filename":"ef29acae5b3feced68a356bdb586216f.jpg","authentication":"41edea5e1ef1ebb58667e84b88b72c17","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL008_00016_o2 copy.jpg","size":566531,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2213,"compression_ratio":0.047407658449230997976808765770329046063125133514404296875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["233334+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["233334+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["233334+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ef29acae5b3feced68a356bdb586216f.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423937,"FileSize":566531,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2213\"","Height":2213,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2213,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:09:32","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":814,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5230},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 23:33:34","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 23:33:34","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":34,"SubSecTimeDigitized":34,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2213,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The Cherokees, as far back as this history can be traced, have been divided into, at least two [\u2026]ts.

Its [\u2026] say that certain beings, more than two, (being connected with [the?] [\u2026] [\u2026] [\u2026] the [\u2026] [\u2026])came down and formed, [the?] world. They then created the sun and moon, and [constitution?] then [lords?] of all this [\u2026] creation.

Sir,\n\n    Supposing that a continual reference to one another would appear unpleasant, I requested some of our Cherokee friends from or by whom I obtained my information, to become themselves directly your informants, and permit you to refer to them as your authors. This they readily agreed to, and accordingly we made This fact known to you last year in a letter by Mr. Ross, and a note perhaps, by Mr. Blunt. If there communications were received, you will feel authorized to refer to Andrew Sanders, a Cherokee, whose Indian name is Snake, as your author with regard to all the ancient traditions relative to God, -- The creation, the history of mankind before the flood, -- the flood, the confusion of languages -- Gods love to the Indians --. Their journey through the wilderness -- entering the promised land. -- their fighting, sun standing still, -- their two great kings, greatest before the flood & , and whatever was said of ancient traditions, he is willing to be your author. He was my interpreter,\n  With regard to the whole process of of war, from first to last three Cherokees from whom I received my information authorized me to say to you that you might refer to them as your authors. Their names are Thomas Smith (Cherokee name Shield eater) Thomas Nie tsa wi, and Thomas Pridget. \n    All information respecting the septenial feast, or U Ki dance ceremonies for keeping of the small pox. -- As for keeping off fevers, etc you may refer to Thomas Smith & Shield eater. All information respecting the Divining Stone and the manner of educating, & training up priests to use it, and the manner of using it please refer to Thomas Nu - tsa wi. In this case you will have occasion to refer to me but seldom, as one among a number of authors.\n  And I can see no unfairness in this method as it has been explained to and approved by the above Cherokees. I have to lament, however that the shield eater, Thomas Smith, is no longer an inhabitant & of this vale of tears. He died about 3 weeks ago.\n   Respecting what was said of their having had two great kings the greatest before the flood, and the second after they went to the land given their fathers. Permit me to add what I have since learned, viz.  Their second great King being as preacher taught them many things; especially he instructed them respecting the nature and use of all herbs and roots  trees and shrubs.\n  And the manner of using them for medical purposes.

Their autumn commenced not much before the unclear of our October, it could not have consisted of more than two months, because December  and January were thus winter months, deemed more sacred than any others, But to return, from the Corn Tassel I learned that the physic dance, anciently, was held annually about the corn merriment of autumn. The priest who directed and officiated at these feasts, was called M li stu li (one who has his head covered always wearing his cap or bonnet while officiating) and also U na hwi sa nu hi, (one who renews heart and body, i.e. cleanses from bodily and spiritual defilements.) He was also the great preacher, & instructor of moral duties. As the priest who officiated at this feast was called the renewer of heart and body, and as the people were supposed to be more pure immediately after this feast than at any other period, we may infer the general design of the feast, viz, to make expiation for all the error and defilements of the past year, so as to commence the new year fully in the Divine favours and defilements of the past year, so as to commence the new year fully in the Divine favour, that you might defend them from all sickness and unforeseen evils. This is agreeable to the statements of Corn Tassel. But here it may be enquired, Why is it not then called \"the feast of Expiation or cleansing. Why is it called the physical dance, or feast? My reply is this in the Cherokee language, the word rendered physic (no we ti) signifies both what heals diseases, expiates guilt, and cleanses from moral pollution. Thus suppose one is defiled by a dead body, the purifying water by which he is cleansed is called no wo ti, physic. Suppose a house is defiled, and Cedar boughs & are brought to cleanse it, these are called also nu wa ti or physic. Therefore the feast might with equal propriety be called the feast of expiation, or if atonement, as the medicine or physic feast. And the more so, because the ancient Cherokees supposed that fatal diseases generally were unclear directly by God, for some offence in some of them, of course when they feared such diseases, they resorted, not so much to what we call medicine, as to what would atone for their faults, and cleanse from all defilements as these, and not bodily indisposition, were the cause of fatal diseases. I fear I have not given you a full description of this feast. The mort clear explanation you will find under the head of \"Ceremonies for keeping of fever & other fatal diseases.\" That is correct, as far as it goes.

Respecting that treaty, as a political thing, I am not even to deceive, yet enforcing it, unless present circumstances, would display a disposition, not calculate to cherish researchers after Indians greatness.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70553,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70553","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5deaacc2251b30d2f29bc35d2c227cb7.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5deaacc2251b30d2f29bc35d2c227cb7.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5deaacc2251b30d2f29bc35d2c227cb7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5deaacc2251b30d2f29bc35d2c227cb7.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:34:20+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:21+00:00","filename":"5deaacc2251b30d2f29bc35d2c227cb7.jpg","authentication":"90d04ba2bb137dfc3d275e1ea73084ff","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL009_00004_o2.jpg","size":615821,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2313,"compression_ratio":0.049304334598324998928386975194371188990771770477294921875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["000704+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["000704+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["000704+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5deaacc2251b30d2f29bc35d2c227cb7.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423938,"FileSize":615821,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2313\"","Height":2313,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2313,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:10:06","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6749},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 00:07:04","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 00:07:04","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":59,"SubSecTimeOriginal":59,"SubSecTimeDigitized":59,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2313,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Cherokee Feasts                 297\n\nThe National feasts, anciently, were as follows, viz the first, at the appearance of the first new Moon in Spring, about the time grass began to grow, The Second was the Green corn feast, when green corn became fit to eat. The Third, or second green corn feast, was kept forty or fifty days after the first. The fourth was at the first appearance of the first autumnal new moon. The fifth about ten days after the last mentioned tied the sixth some later. Aside from the above annual feasts the ancient Cherokees held a feast every seventh year about the time of the appearance scratched out: of the appearance of the first autumnal new moon. They had also occasional feasts, observed as circumstances dictated.\n\n  The above feasts are often called Dances, on account of the dancing which accompanied them. This dance was a religious ceremony the performers always moved in a circle, or circles, with the left hand toward the centre of the circle. Anciently they had but one kind of dance at all their feasts, which was called A ta hu na (u in the 2nd syllable nasal) In this dance, each company i.e. all who moved in the same circle, followed a leader, whom they had selected, whose step they imitated. This leader sometimes led the music, but generally the women when dancing alone, had a musician appointed for them. Special attention, it seems, was paid to purity of manners at these feasts. Wives were obliged to follow their own husbands, and single women their own brothers, or persons of their own clan, whom they could no sooner marry than their own brothers.

The old men, however, knowing that the year did not commence, and that their first great feast should not be kept previous to the springing of vegetation, would never yield to the above innovation to the Cherokee formerly lived in regions Northward of this country, it is probable that grass generally, did not grow till about the middle or latter part of March, and, of course, that this year did not commence till that period. This is farther evident from the following circumstances, viz, The Cherokees divided their year into two equal parts, summer and winter. In this division the winter embraced the whole period from the commencement of Autumn to the commencement of spring But their first autumnal new moon, called the great moon, made its appearance about the time of the first frosts, when leaves began to fall, which must be towards the latter part of September. Six months from this time would carry us towards the latter part of March when, of course, this spring, and year, for calculating their religious feasts, commenced.\n\n   Some time previous to the first spring new moon, the seven prime counsellors appointed a dance, to be performed by certain honorable women, The above counsellors counted the nights from the last new moon and also consulted the Divining stone, or \"Word of Moses\"* to determine when the first spring new moon would appear, and their appointed the feast, to be celebrated at that time, immediately after the women had concluded the dance. \n\nThe Divining stone or re ly sa ta was also called by the ancient Cherokees, \"The word of Moses.\" Why, they do not know. word scratched out (Deer in the water)","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}]

Payne   Charleston S.C.    Carmel   Dec. 15 1834  \n\nDear Sir  Yesterday I had the pleasure of receiving yours of the 8th Inst. and should rejoice to comply fully with your request, were it in my power but my information relative to Indian antiquities is not sufficient to justify me in attempting to give any thing like a connected view of them. And though I have written many things from the lips of the old men which were to me interesting, yet these sketches are imperfect and detached, and could not, without some time, be prepared for inspection. The most therefore that I can do at the present is to furnish you with a few out lines of the antiquities of the Cherokees. \nThey consider themselves, and the other Indians in North America as the real, or peculiar people, and the people especially beloved of God.  They say they came from beyond the sea; but concerning their history previous to their coming to this continent I have obtained no information, except they say their fathers had sacred fire which God handed down to them from above.  They speak of passing through a wilderness long ago, when they carried a certain building which they set up whenever they halted, and in, or about which, the priests sat. (on this continent.)  They say they kept their holy fire till their enemies came upon them, destroyed their building in which it was kept, & drove them away. After this, to supply the place of the holy fire, they made new fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together till they took fire. This new fire they used in their hunting, and war expeditions, and on some other occasions.  The Cherokees appear to have commenced their year with the blooming of peach trees, or about that time, that is, in March; yet their annual New moons commenced with the new moon in September. The Inuks, however, in order to unite all their religious festivals in one, make their newmoons commence with the feast of first fruits.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70399,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70399","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/07fedc1fbae9a5ef392e86628fb40e27.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/07fedc1fbae9a5ef392e86628fb40e27.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/07fedc1fbae9a5ef392e86628fb40e27.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/07fedc1fbae9a5ef392e86628fb40e27.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:19+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:21+00:00","filename":"07fedc1fbae9a5ef392e86628fb40e27.jpg","authentication":"2665187c7163140c31215efea028ff55","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00005_o2 copy.jpg","size":490046,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2167,"compression_ratio":0.041877830761079},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["050646+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["050646+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["050646+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"07fedc1fbae9a5ef392e86628fb40e27.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423933,"FileSize":490046,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2167\"","Height":2167,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2167,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:07:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4345},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:06:46","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:06:46","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":48,"SubSecTimeDigitized":48,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2167,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The ancient government of the Cherokees was a theocracy.  It is said the god at first, or at the commencement of their government, appointed a certain man to be at the head of all their civil & religious affairs strikeout & instructed him in all things relative to his duty, and declared that the office should be hereditary in his family.  This chief priest, or supreme ruler, had seven counsellors who were also priests.  The first of these was his right hand man, and next to him in authority.  He had also a messenger always at his call.  Priests of a lower order reside in all the important towns, each having his seven counsellors, right hand man, & messenger, and were at the head of all civil & religious affairs in their respective towns.  The offices of all were hereditary to a certain extent.  9. The above mentioned persons, as far as I can learn, constituted the National council.  The council however, supported by seven parts, equa distant from each other, near a septagram.  Towards the back part of this were three white seats.  That in the middle was\noccupied by the chief priest.  No other human must touch it. One of the others by his right hand man; but who occupied the third sacred seat, I cannot now determine.  The other members of course sat on the right & left, so as to form a semicircle.  Back of the three sacred seats, was a holy place where no person must ever go but the priests.  There was kept the holy ark, &c. &c.  Anciently the Cherokees had four towns of refuge, to which any one who killed another might flee, and where the avenger of blood, that is, the nighest male relative will not touch him. The door yard of any priest was also a refuge, and it was said that if the slayer could get in sight of the chief priest, the avenger must not touch him.  The refugees, however, if guilty of willful murder, were not safe; for although the avenger of blood gave them up, and tho the priests, to whom they fled, did not publicly decide against them, yet they placed them in such circumstances, either in battle, or otherwise, as would assure their death.  Public criminals were sometimes stoned and\nsometimes were thrown from a precipice, & sometimes otherwise killed. n  With regard to bodily wounds &c. the Mosaic law of retaliation was very strictly observed.

This I believe is the case with the other tribes also. The individuals in these families were supposed to be too nearly related to admit of intermarriages, and therefore such marriages were punished with death.  All the members of one family, i.e. one clan, associated together as parents and children, or as brother & sister, or near relatives.  Thomas Smith  It is said that anciently young people could not marry without the consent of the parents of both parties, and also the approbation of the priest who was to officiate. They were married for life. The marriage of a priest was attended with peculiar ceremonies. His wife must be a person approved by his seven counsellors, she must be a virgin, who had never had a husband, and of unblemished character. Great honour was attached to her character, and in some respects she filled the place of her husband on his disease, till the consecration of his successor, though, in that case, his official duties, generally, were performed by his right hand man.  J Pridget  T Smith  On the death of the high priest, his assistant, or right hand man, appointed the time for the consecration of his successor, and dispatched his messenger to notify the priest through the nation, giving him a string of wild hemp, braided, and having as many knots tied in it as there were nights previous to the meeting. This messenger went personally to all the towns lying in a direct course?, leaving other towns to be notified at his request.  He cut a knot from his string every morning, till the priests being assembled at the time appointed, sent each his messenger to the candidate for office, requesting him to accept the appointment, supposing he would need encouragement and persuasion to bring him forward.

These had small bells fastened to them about their ankles.  Finger rings were common to both men & women.  Anciently it was common for a whole town to enclose a large field, in which each family had its particular share, separated by some known marker.  In this all the town, men & women worked together, first in one part and then in another, according to the direction of one? whom they had selected to manage the business, and in this respect, they called their leader.  But at other times, when not employed at the common field, the men did but little except hum.  strikeout  The women got their wood for cooking, unless as they might be assisted by very old men.  They also carried all the water for family use, pounded the corn, prepared the food for the family, performed all the washing up &c.  But though custom attached the heaviest part of the labour to the women, yet they were cheerful and voluntary in performing it.  What others may have discovered among the Indians I cannot tell, but though I have been about nineteen years among the Cherokees strikeout: yet I have perceived nothing of the slavish, servile fear, on the part of women, so often spoken of.  The women had various methods of baking their bread.  Sometimes they made it in thin cakes, & put it on the hot clay or stone hearth & covered it with hot coals and ashes & sometime put a loaf on the hot hearth & covered it with a shallow earthen pan & then put on coals; sometimes they set the shallow pan on coals and baked the cakes on it.  Again, they mixed their bread in a shallow basket, round, and perhaps 18 inches to two feet in diameter.  The dough was spread over the bottom of this basket, as thick as the loaf was desired made smooth on top, and covered with the large leaves of the cucumber tree.  The basket was then turned bottom upwards on the hot hearth, and taken off, leaving the loaf lying on the leaves.  This was then covered with the same kind of leaves and afterwards with ashes & coals.  In this manner they made loaves as large as they pleased.  They made great use of parched corn meal.  They parched their corn by putting it in a pot with sifted ashes, stirring it constantly while over the fire.  When sufficiently parched, they sifted out the ashes, leaving the pure corn.

The diamond emitted a sparkling lustre, but on those who would not return, if they went, it shone not.  These of course were dismissed & sent home.  New fires was then made, and put into the ark for the wars.  (This was made of clay, like other Indian earthen ware, having a cover or lid; & was about one foot in length.  That ark which was\nalways kept in the holy place, was some larger. --) This ark, together with the Diamond & some other sacred things, were put into a deer skin and carried by the priest or his assistant priest, and must be touched by no other.  The red part and the fawn skin were also taken.  This new fire in the ark was used during the whole expedition.  The first day of this's mant they fasted, as they did also, more or less during the seven first days, and on the seventh night they kept a vigil, when, by various ceremonies, they were fully purified & equipped for the war.  Some were selected to attend to the camps, get water &c.  Those shared equally in the spoils, though they did not go to the battles..  When they encamped, the priest & head warriors slept in the centre, & the common soldiers in a circle about them.  Their weapons were a battle axe, and bows & arrows.  [strikeout: The]] On the end of the arrow was fastened a sharp flint stone, which was sometimes poisoned.  Thuis shields were made of a very tough kind of wood, of an oval form, & their breast plate, or armour was of the thickest part of buffalo hide.  With regard of the manner and time of attacking the enemy, the priest gave direction.  In order to this, he placed the ark, the red post covered with the fawn skin on which lay the diamond before him, as in the council house, and during his prayer fixed his eyes on the ark.  Having approached near the enemy, all halted.

After this, all who retain the position in the army were supposed to be bold,  unharrassed, and efficient warriors, and therefore they generally engaged with great confidence and fierceness in the fight.  During the contest, the priest stood back unless he saw some of the warriors giving back, and in that case, he went forward with great fury, and either conquered or died.  The conflict being ended, they set their faces towards home, but not hastily, or disorderly. before arriving at the town from whence they started, a messenger was sent forward to give notice of their approach, and of their intention to be at a certain place at a given time. To that place, therefore, the people repaired at the specified time.  As the warriors approached, two men, followed by the women, advanced toward them commencing a hymn, or song, in honour of their valiant & warlike deeds.  But though the two men commenced this song, yet the women immediately caught it, and went forward chanting the praises of the warriors.  Each warrior delivered his spoil to his wife, or nearest female relative, who took it home, while the warriors continued their march to the council house. There they were met by the resident priests and the people to express their joy in a dance, which continued during the night. After this was over, and the soldiers had returned home, they could associate with their wives as usual, but not before. Therefore no female prisoners are ever defiled by Indian warriors. The priest for the wars had a peculiar dress.  His cape was red, as was also his seat in council. signature: Silversmith Nettle  What musical instruments were used in war (if any) I have not understood. It is said that the priests anciently had trumpets made of long necked gourds, for their own use exclusively. The people used at dances, a kettle drum and a pipe, made of cane, three or four inches long. They had also a flute made of cane, perhaps  a foot long, blown, as the pipe, at the end.  Dear Sir, I would now gladly proceed to give you some account of the feast of first fruits and other religious festivals, but in that case, the mail would pass, & I fear, I could have no opportunity to forward my communication in time to meet you in Charleston.

May 10 -- 1836,  Dear Sir, Yours of Feb Feb 24th was duly received, though various hindrances have prevented my answering it till now. This letter, sir, gave me peculiar joy, as affording an opportunity of making some remarks concerning my former communications, and of giving you the assurance that whatever I can do to unclear your enquiries relative to the Indians generally, and especially the Cherokees, I shall consider no burthen, but a part of my delightful employment, which calls for no other reward than the hope of pleasing one, devoted to the cause of humanity and virtue. But were it possible for me to oblige you, sir, by any means, so as to justify me in asking a reward, my request would only be, that the Indians of this continent might share a place in the affections of your heart. I say, \"the Indians,\" because I have been somewhat acquainted with several tribes, and find them all the same kind of people, and to me, peculiarly lovely, when not despoiled of their national character by the oppression of others, as by foreign views introduced among them.  With regard to my former communications, please indulge me in a few remarks.  First, In writing by mail, if much time is devoted to apologies, reasons, explanations viz but little room is left for the subject matter of the communication.  On this account I did not state to you the reason why I withheld some information which you requested, and forwarded and some, perhaps, which you did not request.  Most of the ancient customs are confirmed by many of the old people, which others are remembered but by few.  For instance, the use of the war trumpets, made of a certain bone, and Buffalo horns, may be learned doubtless from many, but from one man only, have I learned the use of a trumpet made of longnecked gourds.  These are said to have been used only by the priests. Anciently they lived in towns, contiguous to each other.

Second, another remark I would make, is the following By being handed down through successive generations, their traditions have become burthened with much rubbish. When this seems to affect the traditions, so as to render them apparently fabulous, I either say nothing about those traditions, or comment with them the rubbish by which they are materially affected. But the traditions, communicated in my last letter, are not, as I can perceive, injured at all, in this manner. The character and circumstances of the old men who related them to me, -- other traditions and customs, connected with these, especially some not mentioned in the Bible, and which can be discovered only by a careful examination of the ancient history of the Jews, and their entire ignorance of these antiquarians respecting every other part of the Bible, prove to my mind that their traditions above refered to have been handed down from present to children, entirely independent of any information derived from white men on this continent. Though, when they started to go to the land promised their fathers, they were fleeing from their enemies, yet not one can tell who those enemies were, nor where they they lived, though their leader ascended the mountain, received the land &c. yet no one can tell the name of that leader. Though their greatest prophet, who appointed their priests, religious festivals was by the name of Moses (Cherokee Wa si) yet no one now knows this man to be the same as their leader through the wilderness. The Indians state the reason why the land was marked, and handed down verbally, had been forgotten, this though very probably correct, could not have been from from the Bible. The Indians affirm that God (or rather the Son of God) when He gave the law on a mountain, commanded them to sing, or repeat certain prayers, early in the morning & at evening. The Jews also affirm that God at the time He gave the law, commanded them to repeat, morning & evening, their phylactory sentences, yet this command is not contained in the Bible, so that the Indian could learn it from there. Jewish historians say that, not only the tribes, but the families, or clans, in each tribe, kept distinct from each other in all their marches and encampments which in the wilderness the Indians affirm the same with regard to their tribes &","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70412,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70412","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/93b676da82522464c9158ba894bd4423.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/93b676da82522464c9158ba894bd4423.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/93b676da82522464c9158ba894bd4423.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/93b676da82522464c9158ba894bd4423.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:28+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:20+00:00","filename":"93b676da82522464c9158ba894bd4423.jpg","authentication":"ae5cc713e864b9b5bb58a7c625d5366f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00018_o2.jpg","size":531722,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2169,"compression_ratio":0.045397435240681},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["051219+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["051219+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["051219+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"93b676da82522464c9158ba894bd4423.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423933,"FileSize":531722,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2169\"","Height":2169,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2169,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5100},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:12:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:12:19","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":22,"SubSecTimeDigitized":22,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2169,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"clans under the same circumstances, and say their clans were distinguished from each other by means of feathers of different colours.

Dear Sir, as soon as convenient, after the return of Mr. Ross from Washington City, I hope to lay the result of my enquiries before him. His intention I believe, is to call together some of the most noted antiquarians to assist him in examining the correctness of my writings. Should they pronounce them correct, I could then, with confidence, transmit them to you, and should rejoice to do so. In that case, sir, you might revise them as coming directly from Mr. Ross, and such antiquarians as might sanction them, without any notice of their having passed through the hands of a missionary. This might add to their influence. Should you therefore consider it possible for me to serve you, in the manner above stated, please give me notice where to direct my communications directing to Brainerd Cher.

The old? Cherokees taught that God created man of red earth, and made the woman of one of man's ribs. God soon taught mankind to build high places, on which to erect places of worship, and alters?, and offer sacrifices. There the priests called the people together, and on some occasions continued their preaching the whole day; while the audience? remained perfectly silent. The priest enjoined perfect obedience to God, and forbid all idle & foolish talk, all lewdness, and polygamy. He taught children to be industrious and obedient to their parents. He enjoined obedience to God in secret, as well as in public, because God always saw them & was with them. He also delivered predictions of future events. He forewarned the people that if they did not serve? God, He would bring a flood to drown them all. But the earth would not be destroyed by water but once, the second destruction would be by fire. About sun set the priest offered sacrifice on an alter of stone or a hant? two feet high. The people in process of time becoming more more wicked, would not obey what was told them but pursued their own wicked course. God then sent a messenger to a certain man, commanding him to warn the people to turn from their sins, or he would bring a flood to destroy them. This man obeyed, but to no effect. The messenger was sent again & again, but the people would not hear. Then God directed this man to build a house sufficiently large to accommodate his own family, and some of all the different kinds of animals. This being done the animals came to him & he took them in and shut the doors. The rain then commenced and continued forty days and forty nights. At the same time the water gushed out of the ground, as fast as it came down from the clouds.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70415,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70415","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/f21771e6910e27dca4aa26be22718f3e.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/f21771e6910e27dca4aa26be22718f3e.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/f21771e6910e27dca4aa26be22718f3e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f21771e6910e27dca4aa26be22718f3e.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:30+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:20+00:00","filename":"f21771e6910e27dca4aa26be22718f3e.jpg","authentication":"683ef337e3c5bc35092c3e5bd567dc22","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00021_o2 copy.jpg","size":516974,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2177,"compression_ratio":0.043976079892479},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["051317+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["051317+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["051317+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f21771e6910e27dca4aa26be22718f3e.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423934,"FileSize":516974,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2177\"","Height":2177,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2177,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:12","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5009},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:13:17","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:13:17","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":88,"SubSecTimeDigitized":88,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2177,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"At the end of forty days the rain ceased, and sometime after the man opened a window, and sent out a raven to find dry land, but the raven returned, finding no rest.

While there in the wilderness they were directed to erect a certain building. This had four posts, held together by joists?, & was covered with a cloth made of deers hair & turkey feathers. This was taken down when they travelled & set up when they stopped. The wilderness they had to pass through was very dreadful. At one time they came where there were many very poisonous serpents, and many of the people died of their bite. At another time they came to a place where was no water, they searched in all the low places & dug with their staves? but could find none. At length their leader found a beautiful spring issuing out of a rock. At another time while in that wilderness, some of the people were walking along in single file, and the ground split open under them, so that they fell in & the ground then closed upon them and shut them in. In short the old men said the wilderness was so dreadful they never could have got through if the Lord had not led them.

When all were over, the water above flowed down as before. They then settled down, and called the town where they first stopped Tah mi too?

With regard to the seven clans or families in each tribe, they suppose that there were the posterity of seven families, and of course the individuals of each, are considered as members of the same family still, and not allowed to intermarry with each other, being blood connexions.\nWhen they came to this continent, a certain tribe Delawares, took the lead. These were the grand fathers of all the other Indians, while the Cherokees were uncles to the Creeks, Choctaws, Chicasaws & some other tribes, again, were brothers to the Cherokees. Thus all the red people on this continent are one people, the descendants of the same family.

Sometimes we should suppose it to have been a pure theocracy, in the hands of priests and prophets, who were considered as acting under the immediate direction of God. Again perceiving the sceptre in the hands of one man, who did not offer sacrifice, & of course was not a priest, we should conclude the government monarchical. And again, on perceiving the power of the elders, or old men, we should be ready to suppose the government to have been an aristocracy. It is probable therefore that they did not adhere to the same form of government at all times. Yet, notwithstanding all the variations to which their government was subject, one characteristic continued the unclear. It must always be administered avowing to the command of God.\nThe high priest was evidently their first national officer in the order of time. The first man who filled this office, was chosen by God, on amount of his virtue, and the office was made hereditary in his family.

On the death of the high priest, his right hand man, consulting the seven prime counsellors, appointed the time for the consecration of his successor, and dispatched his messenger to notify the priests through the nation, giving him a string of wild hemp braided, having as many knots tied in it as there were nights previous to the time of meeting. This messenger went personally to all the towns situated in a direct course, and the other towns were notified at his request. He cut a knot from his string every morning, till the priests being assembled at the time appointed, sent their messengers to the candidate, urging him to accept the office, supposing that his modesty would render persuasion necessary in order to bring him forward to so distinguished an office.

And besides these four towns, every priests' door yard was a refuge; and if the man slayer only came in sight of the High priest, the avenger of blood could not touch him. \nWhen a man slayer fled to a priest, the priest either blew his trumpet or directed his messenger to call the town together, and then in their presence declared the man acquitted. When, on farther examination, it appeared that the man was really guilty, he was not publicly condemned, but was privately exposed to the shafts of death either in battle or some other way, so as, generally, to be soon taken away. Public criminals were sometimes stoned, or killed with some weapon, but more generally were taken to the top of a high precipice, where, having their elbows tied behind them, and their feet drawn up, & tied under them, were cast headlong and dashed to pieces on the rocks below.\nIn punishing more trifling offences the law of retaliation was strictly observed, \"an eye for an eye\" unclear (Johnson Pridget).

They then proceeded with him to the council house in the following order. One walked before him carrying a war club, painted red. Another walked at his right hand, carrying a handful of ointment. One went at his left hand, with an Eagle feather, and the fourth was behind. On arriving at the council house, they marched round it once, and then entered, and placed the candidate on the red seat prepared for this purpose. On this occasion the seats were arranged as follows, unclear the white seats for the civil and religious authorities, as usual in the form of a semicircle, in the back part of the house. Within these, placed in the same order & made in the same manner, were the seats of the war chiefs. The only difference was these, instead of being white, were painted red. The candidate being seated, the four attendants marched round him, singing a certain song of four verses. While singing this, they marched round him four times. It was said to be dangerous for common people to sing this song, and therefore but few learned it. This ceremony being ended, the person appointed to undress the candidate did so, leaving only his breeches (flap). The man who had the ointment went to him and made seven streaks across each side of his face, red and black, alternately. Then with his finger made a mark from the top of his head down along his nose to his breast, and then two marks from his forehead to the back part of his head, leaving the tuft in the middle. Then putting his finger on the thumb nail of his right hand, drew it up his arm to his breast? and thence to the great toe nail. All these marks were red, except the alternate black streaks across the face. The man who carried the Eagle feather, then fastened it on his head. This was done as follows unclear. The quill end of the feather was inserted into a short piece of cane, and then the cane tied to the tuft of hair on the top of the head, so as to cause the feather to stand erect. The feather had as many red stripes across it, as the candidate had killed enemies. The other attendant then put on him his official dress. This was of deer skin painted deep red.

None sung, but moved their feet at the sound of the drum, and frequently raised the war whoop. The drum was a pot made as common Indian earthern ware, having the top covered with a coon skin. Small bells were fastened round the rim, which rattled as the drum was beat. This dance being ended, all bathed, or washed all over before they slept. Here it may be well to observe that no warrior must have any intercourse either with his wife or any other woman, from the time of enlisting till the expedition was entirely, completed. This amounts for the fact that female captives are never polluted by Indian warriors. Soon after commencing their march, They sang another war song, consisting of seven verses, and at the end of each verse, raised the war whoop four times. Their fastings, vigils & various other religious ceremonies, especially their manner of making, carrying & using new fire, as well as the order of their marches and encampments are all interesting, but too lengthy to be full described here. Their encampments for the night were ordered with peculiar propriety; all the distinguished officers sleeping in the centre, and the common warriors in a circle about them. See on another sheet. On drawing near the enemy, if an open, fair battle was intended, they halted at a place most convenient for making the unclear. Here, after the usual speeches & ceremonies, all being ready for the engagement, the war trumpet was blown, by a selected person. This was made of bone, from a foot to a foot & half long, and made a very shrill, low noise, which could be heard a great distance. The warriors then instantly raised the war whoop, i.e. shouted for the battle and sprang forward. They ran so as to form two wings, as if to enclose the enemy, which the chief officer &suit? went directly forward, meeting those of the same order in the enemies ranks. The chief officer never retreated, but conquered or died, unless, as was sometimes the case, his warriors, perceiving his danger, seized him by force & snatched him from the power of the enemy. But the more general method of the Cherokees was to set an ambush for their enemies, so as to form an acute angle, & by various artifices draw them in & surround them. Many strategems were used to decoy the enemy and draw them into danger. On engaging in an offensive war, their attention was turned to different ceremonies and in some respects they pursued a different course, yet leaning, apparently on God.

This was carried by a person selected for the purpose, and was raised when they encamped, and especially at the place of rendezvous just before battle. A certain priest & his right hand man took charge of the ark, the holy fire, the diamond or crystalline quartz, and other holy things, by which to unclear advice and protection from above. (More full hereafter) The armour of a warrior was as follows, vir. First, His shield. This was made sometimes of hickory or other tough wood, and sometimes of Buffalo hide taken from the forehead, which was very thick. It was in the share of ancient shields, and used in the same manner, being held in the hand which bent the bow, to keep the arrow of the enemy from the face. In travelling, it was carried by a string going round the neck and under the left arm, yet so as to hang over the left shoulder, and above whenever load might be on the back. If a warrior lost his shield he was disgraced by being set to cooking for the others. Second, His breastplate. This was made of the thickest part of the Buffalo hide, and so placed as to cover the forepart of the body. Third, His helmet. This consisted of a band of the thickest part of a Buffalo hide, ornamented with red feathers. Fourth, a defense for the left arm, of the same kind of skin to defend it from the bow string. Fifth, His quiver. This was made of hard Buffalo skin, large at the top and small at the bottom, and hung down their back in such a manner that he could readily draw the arrows with his right hand. This had a lid attached to it, to keep out the water in rainy weather. Sixth, His bow & arrow. The arrow was armed with a flint, & sometimes poisoned, and the feathers, now tied, were anciently glued to the arrow.

Tenth, His Battle axe, or tomahawk. This has been made differently at different times, unclear as it was made of stone or iron, and was of great service. Eleventh, His knife or short sword. This, like his battle axe has been made differently at different times. It was carried in a sheath fastened to the girdle. A war expedition being ended the warriors set their faces towards home, observing however the most perfect order, & implicit obedience to their officers. Before arriving at the town from whence they started, a messenger was sent forward to give notice of their approach, and of their intention to be at a certain place at a given time. To that place, therefore, the people repaired at the specified time. As the warriors approached, two men followed by the women advanced toward them, commencing a hymn in honour of their valour & warlike deeds. Though the two men commenced singing, yet the women immediately caught the tune and went forward chanting the praise of the beloved defenders of their country. The warriors advanced with a steady, & dignified step, and each delivering to his wife, - his mother, sister, or unclear female relative, the spoils he had taken from the enemy, continued his march to the council house, where all the civil authorities, & the people generally were waiting to receive them. Here it may be said that this apparent indifference in the warriors on meeting their dearest friends, after such as separation, manifested a stoical stupidity quite unbecoming. But let us consider that the warriors having slain persons in battle, touched dead bodies & otherwise contracting uncleanness, could not, without violating their consciences, touch even the hand of any clean person, till they had been purified. Of course, if they had not kept their feelings completely bound, they would have been in the greatest possible danger of violating the commands of God. On arriving at the council house they were received with peculiar joy & respect, yet no one, could touch them and they could have no particular intercourse with their families, till the time for their purification had expired. This according to some was four days, according to others twelve & according to others twenty four. Probably the time for purifying the soldiers was longer or shorter according to the bloodiness of the war in which they had been engaged.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70432,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70432","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/36ea1abd978a7805bd1a17d508d07400.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/36ea1abd978a7805bd1a17d508d07400.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/36ea1abd978a7805bd1a17d508d07400.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/36ea1abd978a7805bd1a17d508d07400.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:43+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:20+00:00","filename":"36ea1abd978a7805bd1a17d508d07400.jpg","authentication":"c1f7eab5e6165f4a66ce95fb23176d76","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00036_o2 copy.jpg","size":572309,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2201,"compression_ratio":0.048152270853316},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052242+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052242+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052242+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"36ea1abd978a7805bd1a17d508d07400.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423934,"FileSize":572309,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2201\"","Height":2201,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2201,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:25","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5885},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:22:42","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:22:42","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":44,"SubSecTimeDigitized":44,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2201,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"or perhaps the time for purifying warriors, differed in different periods of their history. The same priest & counselors who sanctified the warriors for the war, now purified them from the pollution contracted by it. Warriors were polluted by killing any one, - by touching a dead person, or the bone, or the grave of one dead. Various ceremonies were observed in purification, but the most important seem to be puking to cleanse the body inwardly and waiting? to cleanse it outwardly. Having spent the set time at the council house, the last night was observed as a vigil. Two dances in particular engaged their attention. In the morning, just at sun rise a sacrifice was offered, - burnt with the same fire they had taken to war. The warriors then all repaired to a stream of water, in which they plunge entirely seven times, four times with their heads to the east, and three times towards the west. This being done all repair to their homes, and associate with their wives & friends as usual. But such as had been wounded must continue at the council house a long time in a state of? separation. They might dance with others, yet they must always carry a certain kind of staff by which they would be distinguished, and must not associate with their wives till the time for their purification had expired.

In each town of any note was a respectable man, having been selected to attend to ball plays. The ancient priests had nothing to do in ball plays. They were therefore never considered as being connected with their religious ceremonies. But when any young men desired to bring forward a ball play, they consulted their head man (with respect to ball plays) and resolved to send a challenge to a certain town or district, and selected one or two young men to carry the challenge. These messengers went directly to the ball play chief in their town or district challenged  and spent some time with him before telling their business. They then notified him of the challenge, and he immediately gave notice to some of the players, and enquired his bounds, that is, how far he might go for players. This man, with seven others, as counsellors, were competent to act. In accepting the challenge, they appointed the time and place for playing. Anciently ball players must be men of good character, who would play honourably, without fraud or deception. They were famous, - men of renown. Each party then selected an elderly man to direct the dance, another person to sing for the players, another to whoop - a musician for the seven women, on the seventh night. They also elected a conjurer, and seven (players) to wait on him, and seven women to provide food for them, and to dance on the seventh night. An open place in the woods, having been selected, and a fire prepared, the party assembled about dark, and seated themselves some distance from the fire. In sue time, the director of the dance, calling the players, they came forward, with their ball sticks in their hands, the whooper then raised a war whoop, or one nearly resembling it, to which all the players answered, Wah. The singer then commenced Wa hi ie (or more lately hye ko ku ni) wa hi ie &. The players then commenced dancing, responding to the musician, hah, hah, hah, at every repetition of the word wa hi ie, and making motions with their ball sticks, while dancing around the fire, as if actually engaged in play.

It is by this native politeness alone, and not by the chains of tyrants, that the chiefs bind the hearts of their subjects, and carry them wherever they will.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70439,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70439","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/32fd469d3bfebf3a677a7beb71b454dd.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/32fd469d3bfebf3a677a7beb71b454dd.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/32fd469d3bfebf3a677a7beb71b454dd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/32fd469d3bfebf3a677a7beb71b454dd.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:49+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:20+00:00","filename":"32fd469d3bfebf3a677a7beb71b454dd.jpg","authentication":"624ee095a0abd1a639598f736d00f768","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00043_o2.jpg","size":653828,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2207,"compression_ratio":0.054861467720552},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052551+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052551+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052551+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"32fd469d3bfebf3a677a7beb71b454dd.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423934,"FileSize":653828,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2207\"","Height":2207,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2207,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6057},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:25:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:25:51","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":56,"SubSecTimeDigitized":56,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2207,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Dress ? 19 The Ancient dress of kings at their inauguration was as follows First, a shirt of white leather, extending to the hips, second, breeches, rather a petticote, of white leather, extending down to the knees.

These were afterwards exchanged  for horns of silver?, worn on the top of the head; by putting a braid of hair through them, as they were hollow. They left a tuft of hair on? the crown, as large as the palm of the hand, and shaved ring round it about two inches wide, and then painted the hair with a kind of paste made of red & yellow dust. They wear? a head band about two inches wide, made of otter skins, and tied behind. There were afterwards exchanged for head bands of silver. Their caps were of a conical shape, made of otter skins, and having the forehead piece curiously wrought with white hair dyed red. The rim of the cap was often cut near round, and rings of led? some like a goose quill in three pieces, so put on as to set close to the rim which they surrounded. Sometimes other ornaments were hung in the ear. They also had more jewels, sometimes in the middle & sometimes in the right or left nostril.

Ornaments for the neck. The men wore a band of pai...ess? skin, with the hair on, and having small bells fastened  to it. They had also strings put over their necks to which were attached various ornaments, exchanged more rusty for pieces of silver ^ (full moons, half moons, etc). These hung down to the breast.The women had beads made of horn or turkey bone, strung on a long thread, so as to go many times round the neck, each folding hanging lower than the other, so that the breast was nearly covered with beads. 3. Dress for the body. The men wore a leather shirt, with sleeves. This came down to the hips. Their coats, of skins, came to the knees; and their blankets, as now, only made of skins. These were belted round the waiste, & when hunting, were brought over the left shoulder & under the right arm. Their breeches were like those of the priests, already dressing?only of a different colour, some however had those aprons simply fastened at each side, so as to form a short petticoat.

The men wore bands round their wrists, and about the arm below the elbow. These had little bells attached to them. On becoming able to obtain silver, they had those ornaments made of it.The legings, mocasins & garters of the men, nearly as at present, only the garter frequently had bells fastened to them. The women wore petticoats made of wild hemp, and wove, or knit close, down as low as the knees, and then a fringe extended to the ankles. Some had feathers curiously wrought into this fringe. They wore no legings, first? their mocasins made some like half boots, extended half way up the leg, having small bells fastened to them about the ankles. Rings for the fingers were common to both sexes.\nBlankets were made not only of skins, but also of Turkey feathers. The feathers being plucked off, were nubbed, and made as soft as possible. Then a narrow strip of soft, pliable bark, as long as the blanket was to be wide, was put down and feathers placed on it from end to end. Then a similar strip of bark was laid on the top, and there two strips of bark were sewed together with bard thread. Then another strip was put under, and another tier of feathers and strip of bark over, and so on, till one, or more blankets were finished. This, with Turkey feathers & dress hair it is said, they made the covering for the tabernacle in the wilderness.\nDomestic concerns\nFormerly the women got their own wood for cooking, unless as they might be assisted by very old men. They also carried all the water for family use. It was considered disgraceful for men or boys to be seen carrying water. The women pounded all the corn, and prepared food for the family. They also performed the washing. Women, not only performed the labours of the kitchen, but they also assisted in the field. Formerly, it was the custom for a whole town to inclose one large field in which each family had its particular share. In this, all the town men and women worked together, first in one part, and then in another, avowing to the direction of one whom they had selected to manage the business, and whom therefore, in this respect, they called their head man. Individual fields were separated from each by a ridge thrown up, or by stones, or unclear up.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70442,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70442","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/47b6ed23706de19349e67519fa46285e.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/47b6ed23706de19349e67519fa46285e.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/47b6ed23706de19349e67519fa46285e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/47b6ed23706de19349e67519fa46285e.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:51+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:20+00:00","filename":"47b6ed23706de19349e67519fa46285e.jpg","authentication":"f009416043183f3315509d261c16aadc","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00046_o2 copy.jpg","size":612695,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2213,"compression_ratio":0.051270690030292},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052632+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052632+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052632+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"47b6ed23706de19349e67519fa46285e.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423934,"FileSize":612695,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2213\"","Height":2213,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2213,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6239},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:26:32","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:26:32","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":20,"SubSecTimeDigitized":20,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2213,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"P.RR. Anciently, Cherokee women had various methods of baking their bread. Sometimes they made it in thin cakes, and put it on the hot clay or stone, and covered it with hot ashes & coals; and sometimes they covered it first with a shallow earthen pan, and then with ashes and coals. sometimes they put the shallow earthen pan on coals, and baked thin cakes on that. Again they mixed their bread in a large shallow basket. This would be perhaps two feet in diameter. The bottom of this being covered with dough two or three inches thick, the upper side of the dough was smoothed, and covered with cucumber leaves. Then the basket was turned bottom upwards on the hot clay or stone hearth, and taken off, leaving the loaf lying on the leaves. The loaf was then covered with the same kind of leaves, and then with ashes and coals. In this manner they would make loaves as large as they pleased. And that manner of baking gave the bread a most excellent flavour.\nAs they had many ways of baking bread, so they had many kinds of bread to bake in consequence of mixing with their meal, chestnuts, potatoes, beans, pumpkin, etc.etc. They also made excellent bread by boiling the dough, having it first wrapped in corn leaves.\nThey also prepare a most excellent kins of food by boiling corn grits & thickening the soup. Sometimes they put in beans with the grits, and sometimes the meat of hickory or black walnuts. These ingredients render this kind of food a real luxury.\nFormerly they made great use of parched corn meal. They parched this corn by putting it into a pot with clean, sifted ashes, and setting it on the fire, stirring it constantly while over the fire. When it was sufficiently parched, they sifted out the ashes, leaving the pure corn. Meal made of this they considered not only a luxury but also a great support to nature, and used it on journies and war expeditions etc. They prepared a most delicious dish of parched cornmeal & grapes. They first boiled the grapes, and then thickened the soup with this meal, sometimes to the consistency of honey, and then ate it with wooden or Buffalo horn spoons. The ancient old Indians would not eat the sinew that shrank, because if they did, it was said, that sinew would cramp & prevent their running. They would not eat blood or any creature which died without bleeding. Some now will not eat eels or eat fish. Hawks, owls, Ravens, crows, wood cocks, Red birds etc they must not eat . They considered the Buffalo, the elk, the deer and turkey as the proper meat. \nConsidering their means, the Indian women are evidently among the best cooks in the world.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70443,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70443","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/3f84038275e8564503e0fcf3f96f1877.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/3f84038275e8564503e0fcf3f96f1877.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/3f84038275e8564503e0fcf3f96f1877.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3f84038275e8564503e0fcf3f96f1877.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:52+00:00","modified":"2020-10-25T18:55:29+00:00","filename":"3f84038275e8564503e0fcf3f96f1877.jpg","authentication":"928ddf9578839a0a9b9b94685738818c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00047_o2.jpg","size":686524,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2215,"compression_ratio":0.05739687317114},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052648+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052648+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052648+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3f84038275e8564503e0fcf3f96f1877.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423934,"FileSize":686524,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2215\"","Height":2215,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2215,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:35","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6716},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:26:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:26:48","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":36,"SubSecTimeDigitized":36,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2215,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Death, &c.                                        98  P.R.?

Just previous to the death of any one in a house, all the children were sent away, and none suffered to remain, generally, but the doctor & the adult relatives.\n\nIn the death of any one, the male seldom made much ado in weeping, but the females were excessive, and immediately commenced a most doleful lamentation, expressing the relative name of the deceased, as for instance, if it was a child the lamentation would be 'A que tsi, hi hi hi, i.e. my child, o, o, o, or alas alas - this was sung rather than spoken, with a very mournful tone of voice. The expressions of grief were greater or less, according to circumstances. Sometimes the mourners seemed entirely inconsolable, determined to go to the grave weeping. In each town there was a man appointed to bury the dead. This man, therefore, at a proper time, came to the house where the corpse was, and buried it. The most ancient custom was to bury the corpse in the house, directly under where the person died, except in the case of a distinguished chief, and then he was buried under the seat he had usually occupied in the council house. But when not buried in the house, the man took the corpse and carried it himself to the place of interment, followed by the adult relatives. sometimes the corpse was laid by the side of a large rock, - a wall about eighteen inches high, was then built on one side, and a covering of wood, or an arch of stones, made over, and then stones were heaped up over the body. Sometimes the corpse was laid between two junctions, - covered over and then stones heaped on: and sometimes it was buried in a grave, dug in the earth. Frequently a part, or the whole of the clothing etc of the deceased, was buried with the corpse ^ or burned at his buryal. The buryal being completed the funeral procession returned. The man who buried the corpse, entered the house alone, took out the goards & whatever furniture happened to be in the house when the person died, and carrying them away, either burnt or buried them. He then took out all the old fire, ashes & wood from the fire place, and made new fire for future use. He then took the family (after they had taken emetics) to a stream, where all plunged entirely seven times. Then putting on clean clothes, they remained in a state of separation, in some camp, being unclean four days.

The afflicted family, accepting the kind invitation repaired to the council house, where all the town met them and took them by the hand. After this token of affection, the mourners might return home, if they chose, while the others continued the dance.\n\nIn case the deceased was a husband, the widow continued unclear in a single state; and for ten months let her hair go loose without dressing, or taking any particular care of it. She did not wash, nor seem to pay any attention to herself, but wore her clothes thrown carelessly over her.\nAmong the Creeks when a husband dies, the widow, while mourning, neither combs her hair nor anoints it, and neither? washes her face or apparel. But at the end of four months her former husbands brother, or nearest kinsman, may marry her, but no other. See farther on a future sheet.\nWith regard to ceremonial uncleanlinesses and defilements, both of males and females, we may learn there from the Bible but the manner of cleansing was, as might well be expected, in some respects different. See another sheet hereafter. \nThe ancient Cherokees, on going to bed, sung, or chanted, the following prayer, viz., Let my soul be in the first heaven, let my soul be in the second heaven, and so on , to the seventh heaven. The first heaven was supposed to be as high as the tops of the trees. The second, as high as the clouds, and so on to the seventh, which was supposed to be the place where God resides. In each of these heavens angels were supposed to be stationed, attending to the various duties assigned to them. Some doubtless repeated other kinds of prayers.\nDuring the night, even when sleeping alone they were supposed to contract, or be in danger of contracting, certain defilements, therefore the most religious , as priests &c. used to observe the following ceremonies in the morning, for their cleansing. On awakening sometimes before day, they turned onto their ?, and sung four times the following words, viz. Ki na tu hu yi, ko lu lac ti, ha tla su gu ti. They then devoted sometime to meditation, and then sung the same again and so on, till day light. Just as day light appeared, they arose and went to a stream, and standing on the bank, sang again the same words, and then plunged into the stream, and continued under water as long as they could hold their breath.

These two great men, having agreed, dictated war against their enemies. The chief captain then taking a rattling gourd, walked, with his second, to the council house yard, shaking his gourd and singing with a loud voice the following word four times, viz., O gi who ne. This was a song of mourning for himself and his warriors, who were to be exposed to such iminent danger. Having done this, he raised the war whoop four times, to see if he could find any friends, (warriors) to come to his assistance. He then laid down his gourd, and took his seat. His second, or right hand man, then arose, took the gourd, and went through the same ceremonies, and sat down. All the warriors, who heard the war whoop, & were prepared for war, immediately started for the place of rendevous.\nThe second, or right hand man, requested certain warriors to select seven men to order the war. This being done, there were? selected a priest to accompany them, and immediately dispatched a messenger to give him notice of his appointment. The messenger, on his return, came into the midst of the seven counsellors, above mentioned, with instruction from the priest how to proceed in besieging a town, etc. The warriors, now enlisted, and others on enlisting, came under the special direction of the priest, selected as above. None must have any farther intercourse with their wives, or other females until their purification after the close of the war.\nThe priest made new fire (by rubbing two pieces of dry Basswood together, with a dry weed called golden rod, between them, till the weed, then the wood took fire) to be their guide and helper in the war. He called himself second to this fire, that is, the fire was the principal priest, and he was his assistant, or right hand man.  This fire he put in the sacred ark for the war &? these + arks, they had two, one kept always in the council house, and the other used for war. This for war was about a foot long, shaped some like a canoe, having a lid fitted to the upper side. All was made of clay, burnt in the same manner as Indian earthen ware. No one must touch this, but the priest for the war, or his right hand man. Next to the holy fire, the priest valued his diamond (crystalline quartz) which he called the man eater, and used only in case of war. When an enemy was killed, some of the blood of the scalp was rubbed on this stone. A little previous to commencing their march, the priest called all the warriors into the council house. Here it may be well to give a description of a council house. seven posts were set, I call these arks because, with regard to their sacredness & use, they so easily resembled the jewish ark.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70449,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70449","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/241e8933fdf52a7bb440821f2408a28f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/241e8933fdf52a7bb440821f2408a28f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/241e8933fdf52a7bb440821f2408a28f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/241e8933fdf52a7bb440821f2408a28f.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:32:56+00:00","modified":"2020-10-29T22:10:32+00:00","filename":"241e8933fdf52a7bb440821f2408a28f.jpg","authentication":"7eaee8eb7db3ca76e85ae22095778378","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00053_o2 copy.jpg","size":549530,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2201,"compression_ratio":0.046235717771383},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052850+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052850+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["052850+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"241e8933fdf52a7bb440821f2408a28f.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423935,"FileSize":549530,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2201\"","Height":2201,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2201,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:40","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5445},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:28:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:28:50","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":25,"SubSecTimeDigitized":25,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2201,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Deep in the ground, equi distant from each other, so as to form seven equal sides, though generally the roof, where it touches the ground is entirely round.

sheet\nMarriage\nAmong the Cherokees, as among other Indian tribes, are seven clans, or families, designated as follows, viz. the Wolf clan -- the Blind savannah clan, -- the Paint clan, -- the Long hair clan, -- the Bird clan, -- the Deer clan, and the Molly clan. All of the same clan, are considered as near relations, and therefore not allowed to intermarry.\nunclear, it is said, the Cherokees seldom married a second time, as second marriages were not honorable, (unless in the case of a brothers widow, as among the Creeks)\nA priest was not allowed to marry a widow, nor a woman who had been put away by her husband, nor any other woman of a bad character.\nPolygamy, it is said, was not anciently tolerated, but one man must have only one wife.\nWhen a young man desired a virgin in marriage, he consulted her parents, whose consent was deemed absolutely essential. -- All parties being agreed, ie. the parents of the young man & young woman both, the time was appointed for the marriage, and the priest who was to officiate, was notified of their wishes. Accordingly, on the day appointed for the marriage, early in the morning, the priest got two roots, of a certain kind, and laid them on his hand, a little distance from each other. He then, with his face toward the East, prayed to be informed whether those two young persons were designed for each other; and whether, if married they would live long and happily together. If the persons were not for each other, and would not, if married, live well together, the roots would not move. If in case of marriage, they would live well together a short time, & then one die, the roots would move together, but one would quickly wilt away. In either case, the priest forbade their marriage, and nothing more was said about it. But if the roots came together, and continued so for some time, or till the priest put them down, then the marriage was to be consummated. All parties then assembled, and the priest commended the couple to god, praying that they might be enabled to live long and happily together. He then told them that if either should prove unfaithful to the other, that one especially, must go to the bad place. They supposed that nothing could break the marriage covenant, but adultery.\nIn case the bride had a brother, he and the bridegroom exchanged, clothes, & whatever else they had, and considered themselves, as of one family.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70460,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70460","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/03ba724b062b684d53adb3664b78f949.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/03ba724b062b684d53adb3664b78f949.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/03ba724b062b684d53adb3664b78f949.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/03ba724b062b684d53adb3664b78f949.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:33:05+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:20+00:00","filename":"03ba724b062b684d53adb3664b78f949.jpg","authentication":"771041440bc6b97183e0d08517117745","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL002_00063_o2 copy.jpg","size":516941,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2222,"compression_ratio":0.043082724939161},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["053454+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["053454+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["053454+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"03ba724b062b684d53adb3664b78f949.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423935,"FileSize":516941,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2222\"","Height":2222,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2222,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:08:48","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4880},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 05:34:54","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 05:34:54","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":15,"SubSecTimeDigitized":15,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2222,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1052,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1052","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"unclear 121\nAmong the Creeks, a young woman, in the first change of circumstances, immediately separated from the rest of the family, and retired to a camp, at some distance, where she continued seven days. During this time no person might touch her, and she was particular not to touch even her foot. At the end of seven days, she washed herself -- her unclear and whatever she had touched during her uncleanness, and then returned to the family: she was then, & not before, considered marriageable. If a young man fell in love with a girl before that period, he spake for her, and if her parents were willing he should have her, he then supplied her with venison unclear, and she could not marry any other person, yet he could not take her as his wife till after this first separation.

A mother, or grandmother, in unclear cases, affords all needed assistance. The presence of men is disgusting on such occasions. A priest, however, in some instances, prayed for a speedy and safe delivery. If the child at birth, happened to fall on its breast, the omen was bad, and it was wrapped up immediately, and thrown into a creek. When the cloth about it was disengaged, or unwrapped, and began to float, the child was caught up and carried back while the cloth, supposed to have taken the ill fortune, was suffered to float away. But if the child at birth fell on its back the event was ominous of good. Sometimes soon after birth the child was waved over the fire, or held before it, while a prayer was addressed to that element in its behalf.\nEither on the fourth or seventh, sometimes on one, sometimes on the other, the priest took the child to a creek or river, and commending it to its creator, prayed that it might enjoy a long and happy life and then plunged it seven times in the water, and returned it to its parents.\nParents generally, are unclear fond of their children, and indulge them to a degree which often proves their ruin, especially at the present day.

What I have communicated, is what I have received from the Cherokees, and what, I believe, they communicated sincerely. But should we examine the whole again, we should doubtless find many errors, and imperfections. Having had no written language, it may well be supposed that many of their antiquities are lost, and many are handed down connected with some degree of error. Some of the old men remember some things, and others again delight to retain, and ruminate on other parts of their history. It is therefore with much difficulty that we can illicit anything like a connected history of their antiquities. And notwithstanding all this difficulty, yet we must emprt to find the first edition of any work on Indian antiquities, in many respects incorrect, and imperfect. But by means of an imperfect edition, we might prepare one more complete, if the public mind would allow. But in the United states, with regard to Indians, and Indian affairs, the public mind is inexorable. Let a work, therefore, be ever so correct & complete, yet if it is impartial, treating the Indians with strict justice, it will not be popular. How then would we hope for forgiveness in publishing what must of necessity be more or less incorrect. On learning lately from a press in N. York City that the Indians \"are unclear by war, revenge and blood, without natural affection\", & c.  I at once concluded that all further attempts to give an impartial view of the Indians to citizens of the U. States, would be vain. Enough has been said to convince such as will be convinced. But the great mass of the people, evidently, will not be enlightened. When the Indian unclear is held up impartially for a moment, they will instantly dip their arrows in gall, and pierce the hand which holds it, and blacken the picture with the venom of asps, and there prevent it as exactly representing the Blood thirsty savage.

. 29th 1840\nDear Sir,\nYou are doubtless aware of the difficulty of eliciting from Indians any correct information regarding their ancient religious customs and traditions. This difficulty arises partly, at least, from the following circumstances.\nFirst, they are known to trust few among themselves. unclear are entirely ignorant of them, not only of the youth + middle aged but even among the aged but few can be found instructed in the learning of the ancients. \nSecond, those who have the knowledge requisite have received this knowledge as a sacred unclear and

This they readily agreed to, and accordingly we made This fact known to you last year in a letter by Mr. Ross, and a note perhaps, by Mr. Blunt. If there communications were received, you will feel authorized to refer to Andrew Sanders, a Cherokee, whose Indian name is Snake, as your author with regard to all the ancient traditions relative to God, -- The creation, the history of mankind before the flood, -- the flood, the confusion of languages -- Gods love to the Indians --. Their journey through the wilderness -- entering the promised land. -- their fighting, sun standing still, -- their two great kings, greatest before the flood & , and whatever was said of ancient traditions, he is willing to be your author. He was my interpreter,\n  With regard to the whole process of of war, from first to last three Cherokees from whom I received my information authorized me to say to you that you might refer to them as your authors. Their names are Thomas Smith (Cherokee name Shield eater) Thomas Nie tsa wi, and Thomas Pridget. \n    All information respecting the septenial feast, or U Ki dance ceremonies for keeping of the small pox. -- As for keeping off fevers, etc you may refer to Thomas Smith & Shield eater.

In this case you will have occasion to refer to me but seldom, as one among a number of authors.\n  And I can see no unfairness in this method as it has been explained to and approved by the above Cherokees. I have to lament, however that the shield eater, Thomas Smith, is no longer an inhabitant & of this vale of tears. He died about 3 weeks ago.\n   Respecting what was said of their having had two great kings the greatest before the flood, and the second after they went to the land given their fathers. Permit me to add what I have since learned, viz.  Their second great King being as preacher taught them many things; especially he instructed them respecting the nature and use of all herbs and roots  trees and shrubs.\n  And the manner of using them for medical purposes. He taught them what to say in doctoring, and what charms to sing. In his day the Indians were all wise. He taught them how to use poison, poisoned (bewitched) by evil spirits & how to drive the spirit away.

Their autumn commenced not much before the unclear of our October, it could not have consisted of more than two months, because December  and January were thus winter months, deemed more sacred than any others, But to return, from the Corn Tassel I learned that the physic dance, anciently, was held annually about the corn merriment of autumn. The priest who directed and officiated at these feasts, was called M li stu li (one who has his head covered always wearing his cap or bonnet while officiating) and also U na hwi sa nu hi, (one who renews heart and body, i.e. cleanses from bodily and spiritual defilements.) He was also the great preacher, & instructor of moral duties. As the priest who officiated at this feast was called the renewer of heart and body, and as the people were supposed to be more pure immediately after this feast than at any other period, we may infer the general design of the feast, viz, to make expiation for all the error and defilements of the past year, so as to commence the new year fully in the Divine favours and defilements of the past year, so as to commence the new year fully in the Divine favour, that you might defend them from all sickness and unforeseen evils. This is agreeable to the statements of Corn Tassel. But here it may be enquired, Why is it not then called \"the feast of Expiation or cleansing. Why is it called the physical dance, or feast? My reply is this in the Cherokee language, the word rendered physic (no we ti) signifies both what heals diseases, expiates guilt, and cleanses from moral pollution. Thus suppose one is defiled by a dead body, the purifying water by which he is cleansed is called no wo ti, physic. Suppose a house is defiled, and Cedar boughs & are brought to cleanse it, these are called also nu wa ti or physic. Therefore the feast might with equal propriety be called the feast of expiation, or if atonement, as the medicine or physic feast. And the more so, because the ancient Cherokees supposed that fatal diseases generally were unclear directly by God, for some offence in some of them, of course when they feared such diseases, they resorted, not so much to what we call medicine, as to what would atone for their faults, and cleanse from all defilements as these, and not bodily indisposition, were the cause of fatal diseases.

The Third, or second green corn feast, was kept forty or fifty days after the first. The fourth was at the first appearance of the first autumnal new moon.

They had also occasional feasts, observed as circumstances dictated.\n\n  The above feasts are often called Dances, on account of the dancing which accompanied them. This dance was a religious ceremony the performers always moved in a circle, or circles, with the left hand toward the centre of the circle. Anciently they had but one kind of dance at all their feasts, which was called A ta hu na (u in the 2nd syllable nasal) In this dance, each company i.e. all who moved in the same circle, followed a leader, whom they had selected, whose step they imitated. This leader sometimes led the music, but generally the women when dancing alone, had a musician appointed for them. Special attention, it seems, was paid to purity of manners at these feasts. Wives were obliged to follow their own husbands, and single women their own brothers, or persons of their own clan, whom they could no sooner marry than their own brothers.

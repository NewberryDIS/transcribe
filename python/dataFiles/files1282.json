I shall probably come home sometime the first or middle of next week.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102840,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102840","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T00:37:30+00:00","modified":"2020-09-14T17:19:14+00:00","filename":"17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg","authentication":"611d128ace857e86b6c4c2d2a7e56635","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_184_015_002_o2.jpg","size":1292181,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2415,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049543018173453},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["032613"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["032613"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["032613"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg","FileDateTime":1595810207,"FileSize":1292181,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2415\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2415,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:30:18","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:01 03:26:13","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:01 03:26:13","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2079,"ExifImageLength":3098,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1282,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1282","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Beautiful weather exceedingly, and I enjoy it all the more for getting a nice letter from you today.\nSunday & Monday, After a week of very fine weather, was a great rain.

Monday Night 7th it clouded up at night and rained on the night. And it has not cleared off yet! There has been little rain till today, but constant mild warm cloudy weather. Very comfortable weather, here you know we do not have much mud - have dirt instead - the sheets are made of coal slack, all sidewalks are of this material, which is perhaps as good as any gravel. But there is a blackness to it, and an imperceptible shade thereof will follow the feet on to the carpets &c.\nThis forenoon at the Presbyterian Church Old Mr Stafford preached to about 15 persons. If it does not clear off I do not know what the audience will be this evening.

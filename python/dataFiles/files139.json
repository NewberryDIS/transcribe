Please excuse this long rambling epistile I will try and do better next time.\nWith much love from one and all.\nElla Everett.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":32747,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/32747","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/104c31194523f033684eda37379c527a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/104c31194523f033684eda37379c527a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/104c31194523f033684eda37379c527a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/104c31194523f033684eda37379c527a.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-10T14:55:22+00:00","modified":"2020-04-30T16:06:52+00:00","filename":"104c31194523f033684eda37379c527a.jpg","authentication":"8bedc9b584a11934c22d932e34763ae2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_14_fl_532_004_001_o2.jpg","size":945641,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3600,"resolution_y":2135,"compression_ratio":0.041011406019603},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160901"],"TimeCreated":["233800+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160901"],"TimeCreated":["233800+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20160901"],"TimeCreated":["233800+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"104c31194523f033684eda37379c527a.jpg","FileDateTime":1507647252,"FileSize":945641,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3600\" height=\"2135\"","Height":2135,"Width":3600,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:09:07 13:43:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:09:01 23:38:00","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:09:01 23:38:00","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTime":0,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"SubSecTimeDigitized":0,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2409,"ExifImageLength":1429,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":139,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/139","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"After 5 days, return to box 64, Kiowa, Kansas\nKIOWA KANS. ? 15 2 PM 1897--postal cancellation stamp\nhole where postage stamp has been collected\nMiss.

I can give you no excuse for so doing and so I shall not try. I hope that you will forgive me, and I shall endeavor to be more punctual in future. \"New Years\" we had a Welsh Meeting in Remsen Village. In the morning at the Baptist Church, in the afternoon the stone Church on the hill, and in the evening at Morris Robert's Church. There were nine different speakers, each had a different subject given to him to speak upon. Father's subject was \"Adolygiad at y fluoydyn 1849, ac vended Efengulaid.\"?  I think that he made as good a speech then as any time that I ever heard him. The rest spoke very--crossed out very good indeed. We made some molasses candy New Years eve, we boiled a galon but had the misfortune to burn it a little. Robert is in Utica now, but intends to come to Remsen in about a week. Didymus Thomas is there now in the same room that Robert was last winter. Robert is going to have the twoword crossed out front rooms on the same floor. I hope that they will not quarrel. (the ones which were occupied by the Watchmaker and the Sailors last winter).

As I was studying this afternoon, the thought came to me that I had not written to you. It seemed as though it had been but a little while since yours came. I remember walking down from the P.O. reading it as though it were yesterday. It was a good letter,--It did me good to read it,--I thank you for it. Mary, we might to write oftener, but perhaps you have not the time. Your time is somewhat more marked out--crossed out out with allotted duties than mine is.\nIt has been quite cold for the past two days. I have just lit a fire in my stove. It is unusually cold for this time of the year. The month of June has almost passed. Our term here will soon close. I look forward to the last day with feelings of joy and sadness. With joy I shall go to spend the vacation at home. With sorrow I shall part with friends formed here, some of them never to meet again until eternity shall with us commence. I would that I could hope to meet them all in heaven. Can it be that some will be missing? O, has my duty been done to them? What use a person's feelings who knows that an opportunity to do good for eternity has been unimproved? Can I not line as a christian? I have tried; but not in earnest. Remember me, Mary, when you pray to him who alone can aid. There is a great deal for us to do before going to heaven, if God leaves us here any length of time. There is enough work to be done, though every christian upon earth should employ his hands diligently through life. And how many christians we have who are idle.\nletter continues alongside upper left edge of paper\nMary, This letter is a great deal longer than I meant to have it. You need not read it all at one time. I will not write so long a one next time.

In one part of your letter you have let fall some faint hints about my being at home, and some faint shadow of a suspicion as to the cause; either that I had voluntarily left, or had been suspended or had been expelled. Now what to say about it I hardly know. You have evidently alluded to it with extreme delicacy,--showing a sisterly regard for my feelings. Justice to myself demands that the truth of the matter should be made known. Understand, therefore, that I voluntarily went on a visit to see my friends; first having obtained leave of abscence according to law. I made no remark to either of my sisters relative to keeping any part of the truth from you. This explanation, I hope, is satisfactory.\nWe have had some showers to day and it is now quite pleasant.

I hope that you will now be enabled to finish your course of study without interruption. You will then be prepared to act in life to good advantage I hope. I believe that Jane gets along very well with teaching on Utica?. She has now the ability to accomplish, and if she is diligent she will do it.She and Robert appear to enjoy themselves very well together. Robert has lately bought himself a carriage, and Mr. Richards one of his workmen has a horse, so that when either of them wish to take a ride they can do so. Jane and Robert very frequently come up this way; that is: they have been up here three or four times during the past month. You ask me in your letter why I had not told you that I had entered this department of the school. I had no particular reason for not telling you. I that-crossed out? thought however that if it was of any importance that you should know immediately, some one of our family would probably tell you. You may wish to know why I have taken such a step. I will tell you. It was because I felt it to be my duty. A reason for not doing it sooner I cannot give. Before I became a christian I was convinced that God wished me to become a chris-crossed out? minister. It was a great obstacle to my conversion. I tried to persuade myself that it was not so, and reasoned to myself against it but all to no purpose. It seemed singular that God should call me when others, far more tallented were all around. But the most gifted are not always the best laborers for Christ. The best christian unclear the most gifted has have-partially crossed out and written over? the most success. I knew this and finally yielded, and recieved forgiveness. I am now at this school for the purpose of preparing? myself for the gospel ministry. I have before me some-crossed out a great long period of study. I shall probably be preparing for college the next two years, and shall then enter some one of the eastern? colleges, remain there four years, then three years more in a theological seminary. A long time. I hope soon to see you and talk with you. Please excuse for writing so long a letter. With much love, Your bro.

I cough a little yet--raise some phleme.--I am situated very comfortably indeed. Have not moved yet. I have had two or three rides since coming here on ice on the Lake--enjoyed them much--the skaters drew us in a cutter. This morning we rode nearly two miles--we had a horse--the ice is over a foot thick. Mrs. Jackson is very kind to me indeed, and so is Miss Austin. Through their influence I get my rides. My diet consists mostly of Graham pudding, water crackers and toast.\nI received a note from you in Lizzie's letter Saturday eve. Should not probably eat any wedding cake if you should offer it.

I have now been studying thirteen weeks in Whitestown Seminary. I do not know as I have improved my time as well as I ought to have done. But I do know that I have learned something, which I hope will be of benefit to me in days yet to come. In Algebra we have gone nearly to Quadratics, and reviewed considerable.\nO how I long to be home once more, it seems as though I could not wait for the time to come when I shall be one amongst you.

Since the recent merger, a number of changes have been made, one of which has affected my activities considerably. Since we started our publication six years ago, the tractor industry has undergone a number of changes, changes which for the most part have been occasioned by agricultural depression. The production of the old manufacturers has been decreasing for four years, while the production of the Ford Motor Co. has increased until it is about 80 per cent of the total. The old manufacturers have resented Ford's invasion of the tractor field, which made it impossible to cover the entire field. The old manufacturers would not support a publication devoted to the industry unless we kept the Ford out of it, and in view of the fact that Ford is producing such a majority of all tractors, and is increasing his production about 50 per cent every year, we finally decided to make it a Fordson publication.\nNaturally a change so radical has made it necessary to do a lot of hard work. The Ford Motor Co. is making its tractor quite a factor in industries other than agriculture, and since this change was made, I have had to dig up a lot of industrial articles on the use of the Fordson. Since the first of March for instance, I have watched tractors pull submarine cables from the bottom of the Delaware River; pulls cables through underground conduits; raise material in constructing buildings; load White Star lines in New York City; do excavating work in Brooklyn; build and maintain roads in Virginia; do logging work in the Dismal Swap in North Carolina; haul materials in the Studebaker factory in South Bend; hauling lumber in Chicago, and several other things. In the next few weeks I expect to be in Bradford, Pa., Louisville, Ky. and Greensboro, N.C. In addition I get to New York about twice a month at least. It means about two weeks traveling every month, and two weeks work in the office.\nThree weeks ago tomorrow I left for Detroit by way of New York, having a short visit with Margaret while in New York. I spent three days in Detroit, the next three in Chicago, Sunday in Waukegan with some friends, driving to Zion City 6 miles away in the afternoon, and hearing Voliva and his choir of 500 voices; Monday in Joliet and Ottawa, Ill.; Tuesday in Michigan City and South Bend; Wednesday in Cleveland, Youngstown and Akron, and Thursday in Canton and North Canton, getting home Friday morning.

Margaret also was here visiting with Dorothy and Junior a couple of days while I was gone, and Junior had to celebrate his eighth birthday without paternal assistance. He got theorugh the ordeal, all right however. He has been meaning to write you and thank you for the coin you sent him, which we found to be a British penny of 1806 with George III on it. The oldest modern coin he has is a Spanish one made in 1712, but he also has acquired a couple of old Roman ones, one of which has an image of Constantine, which would make it about 300 A.D., and the other which he is unable to identify as to any particular period or reign. Outside of being a bug on stamps and coins, his main activity is music and he is now playing such pieces as Schubert's Serenade and Mendelssohn's Spring Song.\nWhile in Chicago I saw Everett, who looks more like a boy than Junior, because he dresses more like one and has his hair closely shingled. He is somewhat stockier than Junior and I thoughtperhaps somewhat taller, as he came to my top vest button, but Junior goes about an inch above the same button on the same suit. Everett knows a lot about history and seems greatly interested in it. Rachel was asleep.\nI am inclosing a little booklet which I received a few days ago and which I am sending for Edward's benefit. I think it expresses the thought that Bob and I both have regarding what he should do, that there is a greater demand for brains and ideas in the business world than in the professions. Through my experiences with the Chilton Company and contact with manufacturing institutions I am led to believe that the field of merchandising presents greater opportunities than any other. It is now on a higher plane than ever before and involves the human element more than any profession almost. Business nowadays contemplates the habits of the human race, their psychology, analaysis of buying habits, how to reach the people even though it may involve changing their habits, advertising and a lot of things which must precede selling campaigns and keep buyers satisfied after sales are made. The business world is full of romance. Five years ago everybody was satisfied with a wooden pencil with a piece of graphite in the center. Now the Eversharp business runs into millions every year. Back of this was business brains which made an Eversharp a necessity instead of a luxury. The talking machine people doubtless would be willing to pay a million dollars to some one who could devise some idea which would enable them to maintain their former volume of business in the face of radio competition. A friend of mine in Kansas City, who is an advertising man, was recently given $25,000 worth of stock in a company manufacturing a product for Ford cars and trucks, because he was able to devise a plan for advertising it and enabling dealers to sell it. I believe that Edward with his banking business as a background could fit admirably into some business organization. He might have to start in what might seem to","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":32790,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/32790","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/30dc47643ece4be7fdd48a781e350d85.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/30dc47643ece4be7fdd48a781e350d85.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/30dc47643ece4be7fdd48a781e350d85.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/30dc47643ece4be7fdd48a781e350d85.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-10T14:57:31+00:00","modified":"2020-01-21T16:28:27+00:00","filename":"30dc47643ece4be7fdd48a781e350d85.jpg","authentication":"4b4196aa80f61859aeffb305ccdbe45e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_14_fl_538_003_001_o2.jpg","size":1758815,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3059,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053237411160752},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160901"],"TimeCreated":["234312+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160901"],"TimeCreated":["234312+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20160901"],"TimeCreated":["234312+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"30dc47643ece4be7fdd48a781e350d85.jpg","FileDateTime":1507647254,"FileSize":1758815,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3059\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3059,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:09:07 13:45:59","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:09:01 23:43:12","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:09:01 23:43:12","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTime":0,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"SubSecTimeDigitized":0,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3202,"ExifImageLength":3768,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":139,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/139","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"CHILTON COMPANY\nC.A.

But there are so many thing sin the business world. Motor buses are competing with railroads and electric lines for passenger business, and motor trucks are cutting into freight business of the railroads. Motor lines are seeking ways to increase business and railroads are trying to counteract them. Even the millers in Minneapolis would like to find some way to market 200,000,000 more bushels of wheat made into flour, or other products. Farmers are trying to find ways of marketing their products as did the fruit growers of California, who are now selling nearly ten times as many oranges as they did ten years ago. There are big oppotunities in almost every business. Their commodities may differ but their problems are much thesame. Sales managers are making thousands where college professors and presidents are making hundreds.

You will find Walter a very affable and congenial person, willing to assist you if he possibly can, although perhaps you may obtain the impression that he is somewhat proud of himself. If he does seem a little overbearing, and I don't think it will be very noticeable, just remember that he has pretty good reason to be. His success has been due largely to his own efforts. I have known his father a great many years. He is a man of just fair ability, who had a large family, and Walter was compelled to educate himself at Baker University and has made his own way ever since he was in high school.

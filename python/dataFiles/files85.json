Father and Mother came home last night just as we were going to bed safe and well. They have gone to pen. I do not know as she wishes to send any word. I must close now, as I want to go with Ellen to prayer meeting. \n\n Be a good girl, and write soon. Good bye, Your Sister Cynthia \n P.S.

June 18.\n\nDear Sister Anna,\n\n  After I read Jennie's letter, I was almost sorry that I had left you so soon. I hope you were not quite sorry, and that you get along nicely. Awhile after I entered the cars, I decided that if the train stopped in Whitesboro I would get out and stay till the next day with Annie, but they went whirling by, although they did stop at Oriskany. Miss and Mrs. Dowd were on the cars, on their way to Turin. I was quietly talking with Miss Dowd, and waiting for 5 o=clock to come, when I spied Jennie and Jim Powel in the other end of the depot. Mr. Powel had charge of a basket containing our sewing machine. Jennie fell in with them on board the B.R. cars and they were both looking out for me, so I was glad I had not stopped with Annie Ellis.

By the time I got through it had grown dark, and was very stormy, so Miss Williams persuaded me to stay with her. About as I have described to-day are all my school days. Sometimes I am lazier in the morning, and am so interupted in the afternoon that I am obliged to study a little in the evening. I frequently go out evenings with Annie Ellis, or some one reads aloud at home, so that it is not easy to study or write. If it were not for letters I would not wish to.

I think I promised to write two letters in return for that scrap-book, and only one has yet been written.

I guess I shall have to go out every night and weed a little to see if I can get the garden \"thined out\" a little. Henry, do you rise as early as you spoke of doing before you left and take a walk? If you do, where do you go, and what do you see? Have you found any plant that you had not seen before? We found one flower in the woods adjoining yours. The flower somewhat resembles the flower of the wild mignionette, and the leaf looks a considerable like those leaves Jane had when her thumb was swore, to put on it.

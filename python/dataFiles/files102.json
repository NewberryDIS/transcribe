But, as in your case, it was my \ndeep seated horror of the system which is a disgrace to our country, \nand a sin in the sight of our nation's Preserver.  I shrunk \nfrom the idea of living among the poor slaves, without the power \nof aiding them in any way.  The power of adding one item to their \nscanty measure of happiness.  Whether you and I have \nbeen doing right in this matter, eternity will show -\nIt remains for us, now, to leave the result of our decision to \nthat Providence which directeth all things aright.\nIn second once with my good father's advice, I have returned to \nour pleasant \"Holyoke home\", probably to remain two years.

 Copy as far as mark === on page 3  \/annotation \n  South Hadley. Oct. 6th 1852 \n\nMy dear friend \n\n  Do pardon me for delaying so long to reply to your good letter of August 14th.    I am not among the Choctaws! On reaching home, I found that it was a very reluctant consent which my father gave to my proposal, and so many weight objecttions did I find, among other friends, that, after seriously reconsidering the subject, I decided to break my promise to the Byington, and relinquish the plan I had formed. If I could but see you, my dear girl, I would tell you all. I would tell you what was said to me, upon the question that has so perplexed wiser heads than mine, the Slavery question _ It was not fear of the climate, or fear of homesickness, which kept me among my early friends. But, as in your case, it was my deep seated horror of the system which is a disgrace to our country, and a sin in the sight of our nation's Preserver. I shrunk from the idea of living among the poor slaves, without the power of aiding them in any way. The power of adding one item to their scanty measure of happiness.    Whether you and I have been doing right in this matter, eternity will show - It remains for us, now, to leave the result of our decision to that Providence which directeth all things aright. In second once with my good father's advice, I have returned to our pleasant \"Holyoke home\", probably to remain two years.

Is not Mary coming back this year? I supposed she was and have often heard the inquiry \"Where is Mary Everett?\" The Seminary is full - so full, that there are no vacant beds, rooms, or seats at table. The number of pupils exceeds 270, and all have not yet arrived - More than one hundred old scholars have returned, some who were not here last year - the remainder, are strangers to the duties and enjoyment of Holyoke life - Miss Johnson has left her post here and gone to teach the young ladies among the Cherokees. For teachers, we have Miss Chapin, Miss Scott, Miss Jessup, Miss Tolman, Miss Gilbert, Miss Emily Scott, Miss Adelia Walker, Miss Phinney, Miss Sarah Start, Miss Spofford (pardon my naming her, after the rest,) and Miss Shattock - The Latin and French teachers have not arrived - I forgot to mention Miss Elizabeth Titcomb - I must not omit to say, that a great improvement has been made during vacation - under the management of Dea Safford, Mr Hawks and Miss Chapin. By means of a large water wheel, and other machinery, water is forced from a well near the brook, into pipes which carry it, not only into, but all over the Seminary building - The old cisterns are taken away, and, in their stead, are convenient water closets, with bathing rooms &c, &c - By means of a large furnace in the \"Dom Hall\", part of this vast quantity of soft water, is heated, and we can obtain water, cold or hot, in any story, without descending any stairs - You cannot think how great these improvements appear, to us, who have carried water from the \"boiling room\" to the \"fourth story\" so many times - Would you like to know that \"106\" is occupied by two new scholars, and your friend Nellie Partridge? I like my tenement very much.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":25507,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/25507","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/2ef212ed3029b6d7c13690265c90673e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/2ef212ed3029b6d7c13690265c90673e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/2ef212ed3029b6d7c13690265c90673e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2ef212ed3029b6d7c13690265c90673e.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-05T15:47:02+00:00","modified":"2021-01-13T15:54:13+00:00","filename":"2ef212ed3029b6d7c13690265c90673e.jpg","authentication":"89d5f503bad1f35a357b669bfde57bd4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_05_fl_176_004_03_o2.jpg","size":1060790,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2772,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.035433368072256998804192562602111138403415679931640625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["043140"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["043140"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["043140"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["043140"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["043140"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["043140"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"2ef212ed3029b6d7c13690265c90673e.jpg","FileDateTime":1507218151,"FileSize":1060790,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2772\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2772,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:19 10:23:57","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 04:31:40","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 04:31:40","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":6,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":102,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/102","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"My \"Domestic work\" is to take care of the fire in the new furnace and to succeed Jennie Smith in \"waiting upon the milk man\" - Of course I like my work, though it is impossible.

Before this you have doubtless heard from your brother. We called sometime ago and a day was set to have our daguerreotype taken. When the day came Abbie did not feel able to go and the next day we were both thrown from a sleigh and my face was so much disfigured that I did not care to send such a picture. So passed sevel? days & in the meantime we learned that your brother was quite sick and had gone home. The last time we saw him he looked very tired and I thought low spirited. We cannot hear how he is and I hope he is already well. . . . . . My classes get along nicely. I have one that is real good. Miller Cobb + those boys who study latin unclear in Miss Becker's class in Geography so I have them about 17 of these in my class. I hear them alone. We use now Carlee's Geography. I like it a great deal better than I did our old one. How I would like if it were best to pry into the future just a little way. We will try to write more next time at least I will. Lately there is little material for a diary and I am sorry to say I have neglected it. Did you hear the alarm of fire which early one evening not long since was given? Somebody had placed a small quantity of pitch &c on two of the desks in our school room and lighted them. Some men passing discovered the fire before it had done more than to scorch 2 desks & burn a few books. By tracks in the snow it was plain they had got in at the window. \n  A barn on Cornhill was set one of the coldest nights we have had wind burned? down together with 2 dwellings a store and another barn. These & other fires have been the work of an incendiary.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":25603,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/25603","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/54740aaeae648a8cfe64bd3ce2f8198f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/54740aaeae648a8cfe64bd3ce2f8198f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/54740aaeae648a8cfe64bd3ce2f8198f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/54740aaeae648a8cfe64bd3ce2f8198f.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-05T15:51:34+00:00","modified":"2020-05-21T04:43:30+00:00","filename":"54740aaeae648a8cfe64bd3ce2f8198f.jpg","authentication":"e2934783dde6fe55d24c8488ab670976","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_05_fl_184_003_01_o2.jpg","size":958656,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2306,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.038492820661077002675209968174385721795260906219482421875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["044225"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["044225"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["044225"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["044225"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["044225"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["044225"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"54740aaeae648a8cfe64bd3ce2f8198f.jpg","FileDateTime":1507218155,"FileSize":958656,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2306\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2306,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:19 11:18:17","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 04:42:25","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 04:42:25","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":102,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/102","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"College Hill July 26\/57\nVery dear Jennie\nI have delayed answering your welcome letter hoping that I might have a suitable situation to offer you.

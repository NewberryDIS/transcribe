I could not find the mate to your mitten, so I put in a pair of striped ones that Mother knit last Winter. They are rather small, - I am afraid too small for you, but I guess you can wear them. Charles says yours is dangerous business about cutting hands, and getting them torn to pieces by the machines. You must be wonderful careful. I will put in some finger rags as you requested, but I hope you will not have occasion to use them. Issac went back to Foxcroft last Monday.

Charles took them in, gave them a breakfast and set them to work.  They both worked the remainder of the week for two dollars in money, digging well, making mortar etc., which when they recieved, they went off to Bangor to redeem their clothes which they had pawned there for their board.

I do think it is well for a young man as soon he can conveniently to dress himself fashionably and like a gentleman however your dress except the head is very proper and decent for the present.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95731,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/95731","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/2b4f5109351c13109aedefecdebaa384.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/2b4f5109351c13109aedefecdebaa384.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/2b4f5109351c13109aedefecdebaa384.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2b4f5109351c13109aedefecdebaa384.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:42:47+00:00","modified":"2020-06-29T18:31:13+00:00","filename":"2b4f5109351c13109aedefecdebaa384.jpg","authentication":"945759f6d1a4d13ffc9b43878632a950","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_43_004_003_o2.jpg","size":1649639,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2904,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.052597917304357},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["030537"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["030537"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["030537"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"2b4f5109351c13109aedefecdebaa384.jpg","FileDateTime":1586655655,"FileSize":1649639,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2904\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2904,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 16:12:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:11 03:05:37","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:11 03:05:37","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":30,"SubSecTimeOriginal":7,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3064,"ExifImageLength":3798,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1219,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1219","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I hope you won't spend your money foolish;y or needlessly but by no means, hold it so tight as to appear as mean or too selfish.

I wrote to Isaac last week, and sent a letter home by Jo Sargent yesterday. Have you know that Hiram Thompson from Milo was drowned the other day at Bruce's mills, I believe. A man got his foot badly jammed in this mill yesterday. Had to have one or more of his toes taken off, I believe. Have you heard from home lately; if you have, pray tell me the news.

I wish you could come home with Eliab, though there is nothing peculiarly interesting here except that 'tis home - where Mother lives. Milo is a miserable place, especially the Village. May well be named Sodom.\n       Folks are going to work on the new road to finish it next week. Charles work is very backward indeed on account of his being sick & his man's leaving him. It has been almost impossible to get any help. Eliab will report the state of affairs.\n      Mother says you don't know how much she wants to see you. You must run away a week as soon as you can possibly make them spare you.\n     Eliab says you sent a Message for some books, but he can remember now only Barton's Poems, which I will send. I conclude Guthrie's Geography was another, wasn't it? However, I won't send it till I recieve further orders.\n     Recieve much love from us all, & Mother says be a good boy yourself & watch over Eliab with a brother's care. Write often, especially to Mother for she will be very lonely if we are all away this winter, & I fear low-spirited too. Very affec'y\n                                                                                  Sister Lucy.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95752,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/95752","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/606013a2cbccc00bfc3fac6f0f1e183e.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/606013a2cbccc00bfc3fac6f0f1e183e.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/606013a2cbccc00bfc3fac6f0f1e183e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/606013a2cbccc00bfc3fac6f0f1e183e.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:43:15+00:00","modified":"2020-07-01T02:30:30+00:00","filename":"606013a2cbccc00bfc3fac6f0f1e183e.jpg","authentication":"a993cfbec7db474881f8abefebd27c48","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_43_011_004_o2.jpg","size":1061130,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2934,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.033487654320988},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["030755"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["030755"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["030755"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"606013a2cbccc00bfc3fac6f0f1e183e.jpg","FileDateTime":1586655656,"FileSize":1061130,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2934\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2934,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 16:13:20","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:11 03:07:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:11 03:07:55","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":30,"SubSecTimeOriginal":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3145,"ExifImageLength":3858,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1219,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1219","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Very much obliged for your brotherly care about getting my money etc. Good boy.

He has improved much since I heard him three years ago, and there still is room! Quite a full meeting today. I am glad if any preacher can call people out. Col.

I feel sorry we are not going to live in Bangor next summer on your account. I wanted you to live with us. However, the summer will soon pass away. I suppose the present arrangement is best. You do not write about your boarding place, much, whether you like it or not. Tell Ann and Eliab to wait for their letters & I'll deliver them in person - or by word of mouth. Good bye Aff. sister Lucy.\n[upside down at bottom] Lucy. deprivation of sleep. The heart knoweth its own bitterness.

I had so little time, and so many things to think of that it seems as if I did'nt see you and Eliab any when I was at Bangor. By the way, the slip of paper you handed me just as I came away, I lost. Won't you write it again in your next? I put it in my pocket as I thought, but when I got home it was not therein.\n                You have not written whether your bosoms suit you. Am afraid they did not. Tell me in your next, and if not, just where they fail, will you? Seems to me you don't write me so many good nice letters as you used to. Why? Don't you have time? Isaac says 'tis not wicked to perform such acts of mercy as writing to absent brothers and sisters, sabbath day! We rec'd a letter from him last week. Seems in very good spirits as usual. One thing I forgot to mention in Eliab's letter - Uncle Nathan Steve's oldest son - a bright lad of 12 or 14 years died recently. What do you think of Mother's going to Mass. with Isaac when he come home in the Spring? Fine thing on many accounts I think. I am sorry we had not time to call at your boarding place when I was there, but you must percieve I had so little time, I was very much hurried. Ann can call just as well. \n                                                                                                                                                                                 Do write soon, won't you? good bye.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Affectionate sister Lucy.\n\nDon't you think it a nonsense plan they've got about my going to Mass. to be sure I could enjoy it very much & especially if I could have Isaac with me - But wont it be right to spend so much money as it would cost.

I understood that Severence hauled down a load of Sargent & Holman's shingles for one Mr. Bunkers and sold for 60. dollars at fifty dolls. for Mdl? but that is only hear say they have hauled in about 40 ? of Pine logs and the expected to sell them to the Iron Works - cost of dolls. per ? the shingles that are not hauled now will not probably be hauled till the ground settles I expected they would have sent them right down to Bangor what if I see then is quite a pile of them at Bunkers store. I think likely they have contracted debt for hay, Provinder etc, about here to the amount perhaps of $50, but it is only guess work they ow me $97 1\/2 Dolls and gave me an order on you to be paid in cash when","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95786,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/95786","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/bcfab0f4f323c963c67055253b1a5f56.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/bcfab0f4f323c963c67055253b1a5f56.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/bcfab0f4f323c963c67055253b1a5f56.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/bcfab0f4f323c963c67055253b1a5f56.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:44:02+00:00","modified":"2020-07-02T19:00:06+00:00","filename":"bcfab0f4f323c963c67055253b1a5f56.jpg","authentication":"196b41657bcee45e9a514d835bde154d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_44_011_002_o2.jpg","size":1545970,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2877,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049755081811043},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["225935"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["225935"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["225935"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"bcfab0f4f323c963c67055253b1a5f56.jpg","FileDateTime":1586655658,"FileSize":1545970,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2877\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2877,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:12 14:46:39","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:11 22:59:35","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:11 22:59:35","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2948,"ExifImageLength":3688,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1219,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1219","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"you received shingles enough to pay what they owe you and enough to pay me.

The story is he has been waiting to get his money of Hector to pay his taxes - Last week Mr. Drake (Collector & Constable) threatened to do so, and yesterday morning actually came, with horse and waggon to carry him to Bangor! At first Charles declared he would go, and was stuffy as Drake, since he would not wait till next week, when Charles and Hector both guarantied him the money at that time.

Had received no help for that when he last wrote, but his general health was much improved - felt invigorated and was in fine spirits. They packed him in wet sheets several times a day - said it was very disagreeable at first - took him some time to get accustomed to it. He wrote about a very bad case of spinal complaint perfectly cured. So near as I can learn they have been more successful in their treatment of spinal diseases than anything else.  Yours was occasioned by an injury of the spine, and it seems as though their treatment might be beneficial to you, but I don't know what to advise you, I am sure. I wish if you do conclude to try it, Mother could go too, to be with and take care of you. I feel as if you will get better there at home, if you are careful - as the cool weather come on, you will feel stronger - but perhaps in some other way you might get well quicker. I wish you would write to me often and particularly, just how you get along, and all about everything. I want to see little Charlie dreffully. The little boy that lives with Mr. Cutts, his nephew I believe, broke his leg badly in five or six places last week. A log rolled on it. Pres.

Thatcher has pd him $12.50 and I have paid him $20. ballance about $60.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95813,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/95813","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/5669cbcfa12ae60409b892844a925056.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/5669cbcfa12ae60409b892844a925056.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/5669cbcfa12ae60409b892844a925056.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5669cbcfa12ae60409b892844a925056.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:44:38+00:00","modified":"2020-07-03T03:19:47+00:00","filename":"5669cbcfa12ae60409b892844a925056.jpg","authentication":"0c3f216f42c5e2d4eadb0e4f99ad218a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_45_007_003_o2.jpg","size":1422966,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2832,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046524050533584},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["230351"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["230351"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["230351"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5669cbcfa12ae60409b892844a925056.jpg","FileDateTime":1586655659,"FileSize":1422966,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2832\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2832,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:12 14:48:03","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:11 23:03:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:11 23:03:51","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":94,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2962,"ExifImageLength":3764,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1219,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1219","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Tuesday 14th - Isaac would not stay here all night - did not go until Friday.

I do hope you will think best to wait a few days if you go, and come to our house and get nicely rested before you go farther. Mother ought he not to be well supplied with good warm flannel drawers & undershirts.

How we do like Prof. Shepherd! and how he does preach - especially sometimes! Next Sabbath on Peter's fall & recovery. I am very anxious to hear it, but fear it will rain, as it does today. I wish Mr. Crosby could go to Water Cure. He is a wretched man as he is nowadays. I should hardly be surprised if he should commit suicide some day, though people say he has not courage to do it. I don't know how many times he has said he was in hopes the Cholera would have carried him off. One trouble is, he has always been in the habit of eating luncheons at all times and seasons - drinking tea & coffee etc. You do not say what is the matter with your friend Dole - nor whether he has received benefit. I am very sorry you are to lose such a good society. I know it is difficult for you to find one whose society you really enjoy, as you seem to his. With regard to my own health, I call it very good now. I do not doubt that I have some spinal disease about me very slight however- but if I have plenty of exercise & not too much sedentary employment, presume it will not grow upon me, in which case I shall call myself well. I don't see why you don't writ something about yourself - what we most want to know, you do not even mention.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95828,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/95828","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/a4fd7ffdb69624510a383c2dcd2f227f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/a4fd7ffdb69624510a383c2dcd2f227f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/a4fd7ffdb69624510a383c2dcd2f227f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a4fd7ffdb69624510a383c2dcd2f227f.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:44:59+00:00","modified":"2020-07-03T21:30:11+00:00","filename":"a4fd7ffdb69624510a383c2dcd2f227f.jpg","authentication":"3db27f6902b45b92c74b7533c86a461d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_45_011_004_o2.jpg","size":1342176,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2773,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044816284008495},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["230531"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["230531"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["230531"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a4fd7ffdb69624510a383c2dcd2f227f.jpg","FileDateTime":1586655660,"FileSize":1342176,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2773\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2773,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:12 14:48:50","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:11 23:05:31","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:11 23:05:31","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":96,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2854,"ExifImageLength":3704,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1219,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1219","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Do you feel as well as before you left home?

About this time I feel like talking with you a little, for I suppose that you of all other can best sympathize with me; if indeed I deserve sympathy after having left my quiet and happy home & entered voluntarily on this scene of vexation. I had made up my mind to spend the rest of the Summer at home, but I d not deny that the \"Almighty dollar\" (or \"filthy lucre\" as some would have it) possesses some influence over me as well as other people. I suppose I, as most others, teach for the pay; and one thing I am sure of, we school - ma'ams earn all we get!  Well to proceed to business. Here I am in La Grange, snugly ensconced at one Mr. Kenney's, who, I believe, is an acquaintance of your father's from 'Old Hampshire State.' As good luck would have it, I went not to Mr. Trott's board. I believe friend Libbey thought it not good that I should live on beans this summer, or be lived upon by B. b's. Do you understand? eh?\n            Some people conclude that you did not recieve the best of treatment last Summer, but Mr. Libbey said you kept your own counsel. I told hm I should have my case in his hands, but if he did'nt provide a good boarding place, I should forthwith rebel, and go straight home.

the bank near a beautiful spring on Charles' upper lot, where were twenty head of cattle struck with wonderment at our operations, and strongly inclined to dispute our right to invade their territories.\n\n               My school is not the worst in the world by any means, but I think it the most wearisome one I ever had charge of.\n      Have about 40 scholars, the oldest only 13 years old. Such an array of little ones I never before saw together. Sixteen Abecidarians! H. Tolman kept here three weeks before she was turned away, so I shall probably have no more than eight weeks or thereabouts to keep. We seldom find ourselves so badly situated that there are no pleasant things to counterbalance the disagreeables - and I usually find it the happiest way to \"look on the bright side,\" enjoy what there is to be enjoyed, & as much as possible forget the rest. Contentment is in the state of our mind, not in our condition. I am too selfish for a school -teacher. The school-ma'am is expected to take an interest in every thing pertaining to everybody's \"little dears,\" be they never so ugly or disagreeable.\n She must hear with patience, & interest if possible al the long yarns which garrulous old women are pleased to spin for her, nod assent to this, and \"shake the negative\" to that, when her wearied spirit would fain wander away to seek repose in a more congenial atmosphere. As I said before I love myself & mine too much to bestow so much care and thought on strangers. Yet I ought to think some of doing good, and hope I do. If you have patience to read this through, you are a wonderful child.I did'nt know 'twas in my power to make such an awful looking letter; but I beg you'll excuse it.

I never knew there could be so much beauty in a child's countenance apart from forehead & eyes.\n\n             What a pity he is so injured! His mother seems to love him more than any of the others. I conclude these folks are pretty clever. I staid at Mr. Libbey's the first night. Mrs. L. is in very truth a notable great good natured sociable soul, isn't she? They say \"Mehitable is a real nice girl - yes Mehitable is the first rate of a girl, but she's drefful bashful.\" However that does not lessen her any in my esteem.

The ride would do you good & the visit would do me more good than I can tell you. Why won't you? I had no thought of leaving Milo in such haste when I last saw you. Mr. Libbey came after me Mond. morn. and found me at (not in) the wash tub. Mother had just returned from Exeter, and I could hardly make up my mind to come at any rate, but he over persuaded me. By the way let me tell you what a fine time I had while Mother was gone. Sat. P.M. after being alone till I wanted to see somebody, Mr. Greenlead came & invited me to a boat ride and Pic Nic.

Mr. Crosby's Mother, a very feeble old lady lives with them. We have the large Parlor chamber, where I now am sitting by a comfortable fire all alone to myself. Wish you and Jos. were here with me just now. Sitting in the sun by the window is the sweet little Primrose with eleven beautiful blossoms, (much larger than last year) besides buds too numerous to mention. By its side the tall Cactus, with some thirty buds, some of which are nearly blown. It is truly a beautiful thing. Very much obliged to you Joseph. I don't feel very bright this morning. Was pretty tired last night. The road was not muddy scarcely at all, but very rough, full of holes. I advise Joseph not to come down unless absolutely necessary, until we go to keeping house, as by that time the roads will probably be better, so it will not tire him so much.\n     May 7th Thought when I commenced this I should finish and send it last week, but here it is yet.

Ellen had commenced her school so she will not be with us any more at present, but Oliver Furber has come home & is going to join it. I hope there will be some good done. It is thought that there is considerable feeling among the people here and oh may it result in a great revival. My side warns me that it is time for me to stop writing for this time. I wrote thus far Sat. yesterday. I went to the mill to a society meeting. Mr. Boyd had been expected but his Father (at Berwick) was sick & sent for him, he write to Mr. H. that he should be here soon as he returned. We had an interesting B. class, but for thou - Your brother C. is talking of going to B. soon and I should like he have another letter from you. Give my love to Ann, tell her I should be happy to receive a letter from her by him. I have not heard C.

I want to see you very much indeed. When you answer this letter I want you to tell me how you got home & send me all the news you can. I have not much to say in this letter. I did not know that Mrs. Searles was going so soon or else I should have written a longer one but you must Excuse me. I am well and I hope you are. Give my love to Miss Rich & your mother & take a portion of it to yourself and before long I hope we shall meet again. Oh Lucy! I had almost forgotten it. Mary Newcomb sends her best love to you and Miss Rich. Do you remember the 2nd of October and your silk dress it is 4 years ago but it does not seem so, but time flies rapidly. I suppose you know that Mr. Whipple has left the Sunday School as Superintendent, but when he left  (after the absence of three or four weeks) he intended to take a Class but his health would not permit. His lungs are in a Very dangerous state. He Visited the Sabbath School Oct 18th & with much difficulty said a few words, he bid us Farewell as his Physician advise him to go south as it was uncertain weather he should see us again.

But having learned from your friend Mrs. Cutler who visited the family in which I board one afternoon of the present week that you are still in Milo, I gladly embrace this favorable moment for gratifying this desire, Though the subject upon which I address you may be the least of all expected. Yet, dear L. be assured that since our first acquaintance thou, who are destined to become the arbitress of much of my future happiness or misery, has possessed the most tender of my heart's affections.\nThat you would wish in any way to be the cause of the latter I cannot allow myself for a moment to believe for I feel it would be doing you the greatest injustice to think that a heart possessed of virtues so sensitive & tender as yours could ever be the willing agent of unhappiness to any one.\n                     Permit me to say, dearest L., that naught on earth could, at

I was sorry to hear that you was sick for I wanted you to come back and attend school this term. you said you wanted to see all the girls; and I dare say they all want to see you.\n\nWe get along very well this term; and I think we make great progress in our studys. We have the same task yet, to perform in school; that is writing compositions. I do not dread composing them so much as I used to. E Marston; H. Mcintire; and a number of other schollars from our school; attend the Littlefield school this term. our examination is in about a fortnight; and you cant think how I dread it.

I hope ere this you have fully regained your health and can now lift up the voice of thanks - giving to the Giver of all our mercies for the full enjoyment of one of Earth's greatest comforts.\n   Health is a blessing we but little prize as we ought until we are for a time deprived of its enjoyments. And even when we have learned something of its worth by painful experience how soon do we forget duly to regard those laws, so well known to us all designed for its preservation? Perhaps next to the interests of the soul are the means of health neglected by mankind generally. I do not say this reflecting that your sickness was in any way attributed to a want of suitable care & caution by you. Yet I do feel especially desirous that in case you may have partially or altogether recovered you should use every precaution to retain your health - almost the only thing that renders life itself desirable though I doubt not you will.\n  During the two week before this I was engaged in teaching in Topsham a town adjoining this.

How true it is \"we know neither the day nor the hour when the son of Man cometh.\"\n The religious interest here is very low, though I think the prospect of better time is a little more flattering now than it has been, but still the ways of Zion mourn & comparatively few come to her solemn feasts, her priests sigh, she is yet in bitterness.

that I might have sufficient time to answer it as it deserves. You ask if I know of any particular persons who I think are feeling thoughtful on the subject of religion? I know of only one who I think may be and perhaps I am mistaken in that one though I do earnestly desire that that individual may soon be numbered among the people of God. As I have so little evidence that my hopes are well grounded I dare not mention the name. Lucy, the still small voice of the Spirit has been among us when and where we know not of it.

I can but hope it may not be so in time to come.

It was truly an interesting one and I heard several say that one more so had not been enjoyed for many years. Tuesday afternoon two literary societies, Peucinian and Athenaean held their anniversary meetings. The Athenaean selebrated first. It was addressed by the Rev. John Lord of Berwick, generally know as a lecturer on History. His subject was the Middle Ages. He gave a vivid description of the state of society in those times, and vindicated them from those evil tendencies so often charged upon them. He confined his remarks chiefly to the Germanic tribes, naming some of the prominent traits of character which distinguished the period & especially these tribes. Among which he instanced their love of personal independence, high veneration for woman & for the priesthood and maintained that it was by the power of faith that our progenitors were rescued from the evil influences which surrounded them. Their philosophy, next fell under his revision. The disputes of the schoolmen were treated of, & he close ? a high panegyrie on their modes of investigation & dwelt ? upon the advantage which might result from a more ? entrance by modern scholars into \"the inner temple of ? philosophy.\" The stile of Mr. L.'s writing is peculiar and interesting.

Perhaps you will be a little surprised when I tell you that when I first opened it, I could not imagine who it was from, and that I had really forgotten who Lucy H. Metcalf was; but I soon found out, and right glad was I to hear from you and your family, of whom we had heard nothing for a long, long time. I don't wonder I had forgotten you, from the fact that I never was much acquainted with you, and also from the length of time that has intervened of since I had seen you, and more particularly since I had heard from you. Isaac and I corresponded a short time after you went to Milo, but  the correspondence ceded with Isaac for what reason I never knew. I wrote to him last, and since then, it has been only by accident that we have heard from any of you; and you may rest assured that I and indeed all of us were very glad to hear from you once more, and hope that for the future we shall hear from our friends in Maine oftener.\n I reccollect very well seeing you in Boston, and although \"old time\"had nearly effaced the circumstance from my memory, yet the reception and perusal of your letter brought it up again fresh to my memory, the encroachments of \"Old Father Time\" to the contrary notwithstanding! I should like very much to see you, Isaac, Mayo, Aunt, Charles etc. and hope to have the pleasure soon; as you write that you think of spending the next Winter in Mass; and also that Aunt & Ann think of visiting Mass. Should you do so, you must not fail from coming to Lowell. We heard of you last visit to Mass, and were very much disappointed because you did not visit us, and hope you will not again neglect us. We had heard of Almeda's removal to Milo; but did not know it until several months after they","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95930,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/95930","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/a5ff9b901b0596500efd0f038214158a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/a5ff9b901b0596500efd0f038214158a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/a5ff9b901b0596500efd0f038214158a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a5ff9b901b0596500efd0f038214158a.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:47:18+00:00","modified":"2020-07-06T21:03:06+00:00","filename":"a5ff9b901b0596500efd0f038214158a.jpg","authentication":"ed1a62a45e397325b7ae8dca2e6fd994","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_47_021_002_o2.jpg","size":1522474,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2895,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048694236550886},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["231737"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["231737"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["231737"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a5ff9b901b0596500efd0f038214158a.jpg","FileDateTime":1586655665,"FileSize":1522474,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2895\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2895,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:12 14:53:41","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:11 23:17:37","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:11 23:17:37","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3077,"ExifImageLength":3826,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1219,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1219","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"had gone. Being in Boston I called, where they used to live, and was informed by the people in the house that they had gone to Milo, which a little surprised me, as I had not know of their intention to do so. We were glad to hear of their good health, and hope the change from city to country will be beneficial. And you inform me that you are attending an Academy in Foxcroft, which from your description must be a very pleasant and good school. You doubtless are enjoying yourself finely, particularly if you love your books, and I presume there is no doubt of it, as all of your family were always very fond of books and study. Your studies are all interesting, particularly Astronomy & Philosophy, and I presume you find them so. I am anxious to know one thing; viz how old you are; will you inform me when you write again & so do. Also the age of Isaac & Mayo; I have really forgotten.  I did not see the lady who brought your letter, and presume she did not come to Lowell, as it was mailed at Methuen about 10 miles from Lowell. We were sorry to hear of Aunt's ill health, and hope that relaxation from her duties will completely restore her to health again. I have been quite unwell the past Winter with Bronchitis and Inflammation of the Lungs, occasioned at first by a cold and made worse by singing. Was confined to my room several weeks, and no one allowed to see me,  as the least exercise of my lungs produced coughing. I had a severe cough and was not able to attend to my business for about two months. I am now better, and my cough has nearly left me, and the warm weather will I think entirely effect a cure. I think of going to the South in the fall, as the cold winters of New England do not agree with me. The rest of our family are in good heath and have been so for sometime.

It is a beautiful place, and I enjoyed myself finely while there, and think some of visiting there again this summer.

Six weeks ago, I was awakened from my slumbers coughing, immediately I began spitting blood, in a few moments raised more than a gill? I was soon checked however by sale. I was not at all alarmed for I supposed it some little ruptured vessel of the stomach.

Providence has a locality, tho it's not on the map, lying 15 miles from the northern shore of the Ill. river you'll see Princeton which is the Shire town, & Where I've had pleasant visits.\nThe same Eve yr. letters came, one came also from Anna she's clever to me in writing & so am I to her.  She told me of Eliab. I wish him a 'heap' of happiness. I wish Isaac was nearer to me, we would have 'fun', despite that lady whose name I've forgotten. Josephine, Henryette, Maryette, something. Sorry for Mrs. Furber & Belle. I became quite attaced to B. and very much regretted leaving the family at Buffalo. My love to her when you unite, & ask B. to write to me. If Mrs. Thaxter had died, I should have hastened home to the responsibilities of Mother-in-law.\n\n          I am glad Mrs. Blood has called. She is a very excellent & interesting lady. She writes that Mr. N. Harlow thinks to remove to Conn. Please tell me.\n       Ask yr. husband if it was sufficiently affectionate to sat \"I remember her\". How do I know whether it is good or evil that's treasured up.\n        Love to him & yr. good Mother.\n       If Mrs. Benj. Plummer does'nt call or you she is naughty.\n             Adieu\n                                                        With love sincerely yrs, Elizabeth\n\nI'm promised horseback riding (very much the fashion) when \"harvesting\" is over. Been three times blackberrying 9 miles last time & horse vehicle. Any dump of a N. Englander would laugh outright at their style of riding & carriages.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95967,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/95967","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7bbd86dd0c4eb139752c53c435bd11bf.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7bbd86dd0c4eb139752c53c435bd11bf.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7bbd86dd0c4eb139752c53c435bd11bf.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7bbd86dd0c4eb139752c53c435bd11bf.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:48:08+00:00","modified":"2020-07-08T00:11:15+00:00","filename":"7bbd86dd0c4eb139752c53c435bd11bf.jpg","authentication":"fc9dd3cbb3271ecd702c74ba74a64c40","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_48_007_001_o2.jpg","size":1606114,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2917,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050981919526657},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["232157"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["232157"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["232157"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7bbd86dd0c4eb139752c53c435bd11bf.jpg","FileDateTime":1586655666,"FileSize":1606114,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2917\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2917,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:12 14:55:03","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:11 23:21:57","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:11 23:21:57","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3002,"ExifImageLength":3704,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1219,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1219","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Lizzie Doe\n                                                                                                                                            Lameville Sept. 14th \/ 51\n\nMy Lucy dear\n\n                  Your last kind favor came to me at this place about two weeks since.

My eldest brother Thomas decided on teaching, rented his place, & we disbanded. By special invitation I came here, (to stay a little) homeward bound. Two weeks of much enjoyment passed. when the day as the shadows of evening were deepening. My brothers, three, drove up. One run hastily in, to say to me that brother Frank was not quite in his right mind etc. The next moment himself appeared, clasped me in his arms, with tears of joy exclaiming \"I thought you were dead, I saw you in heaven & I wanted to get to you\" During the 48 hours he remained with us we had medical attendance almost constantly, but he grew worse at length violent. He was taken to Chicago to the insane Asylum in so high an excitement that the Dr. there in charge said in one night he gave him morphine sufficient to kill five well men, with little effect. An extra man is employed with him, the charge is $10.00 per week. He has been there nearly three weeks they have succeeded in allaying the violence of emotion & in inducing sleep. The cause we do not know. The premonotory symptoms for a few weeks were extreme irritability, & sleepless nights. The physician writes me every week.

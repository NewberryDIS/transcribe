Very numerous, and almost, if not quite, Cannibals in their nature\nIn the Spring of 1850, the Pilot Boat \"Hagstaff\" of New York while cruising along this Coast, entered the mouth of Rogue River in about Lat 42\u00b0 30' for the purpose of obtaining a supply of fresh water\nSoon after landing, or casting anchor on the River, the vessel was attacked by the Indians, and it was soon found necessary to abandon the vessel and flee to the mountains\nBy so doing the men escaped from the Indians and after undergoing many hardships, perils & privations, arrived at the Willamette settlements in an

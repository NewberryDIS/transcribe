Fourteen years before, and Onondaga returning from the overthrow of the ERIES, saw a demon in the form of a little dwarf, that they said, had already appeared to several others; they called him TARON-HIA-WA-GUI, which signifies the one who holds the heavens.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":59218,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/59218","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b3da229dd039e727f4c8b8ae23187703.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b3da229dd039e727f4c8b8ae23187703.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b3da229dd039e727f4c8b8ae23187703.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b3da229dd039e727f4c8b8ae23187703.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-17T15:44:46+00:00","modified":"2020-03-16T20:06:04+00:00","filename":"b3da229dd039e727f4c8b8ae23187703.jpg","authentication":"08e22c41309a3c5208c7bc7fb9055daa","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_Art_Grider_Descriptions_00008_o2.jpg","size":1475670,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3600,"resolution_y":2311,"compression_ratio":0.059124236742150997059308537018296192400157451629638671875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120628"],"TimeCreated":["093302+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120628"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120628"],"TimeCreated":["093302+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120628"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120628"],"TimeCreated":["093302+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120628"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b3da229dd039e727f4c8b8ae23187703.jpg","FileDateTime":1521301480,"FileSize":1475670,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3600\" height=\"2311\"","Height":2311,"Width":3600,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"44mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:10:25 15:20:26","Exif_IFD_Pointer":154},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:28 09:33:02","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:28 09:33:02","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":38,"SubSecTimeDigitized":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":6766,"ExifImageLength":4345,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":946,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/946","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The dwarf spoke to them-said-\"It is I who hold the heavens, + have care of the earth.\" it is I who preserve men, give victory to those who fight; it is I who has made you master of the Earth + the conquerors of so many nations; it is I who have made you victorious over the HURONS + Lastly it is I who have made you what you are; if you wish my continued protection, listen to my word + execute my orders.\" After those declarations he disappeared among the HURONS in 1642 the War God appeared.

This is followed by the FRIENDSHIP SMOKE, one Pipe is passed from one person to another. After the Feast + Smoke, the light is extinguished and the Flute player imitates the song of the night bird the WHIPOORWILL which is the guiding song of the participants all night long. The persons representing the various Clans present, manifest their presence by imitating the notes. If mistakes are made-the Flute player corrects by notes from this instrument. Before the dawn of day the Flute player SCREEMS like an EAGLE, when the meeting breaks up, the women serve refreshments, each is served his portion in a pail, or whatever they have to hold it, + then go to their lodges where they must be before the light of day.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":59228,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/59228","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/58939ca6672f80e02e61f80bb8bc41d0.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/58939ca6672f80e02e61f80bb8bc41d0.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/58939ca6672f80e02e61f80bb8bc41d0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/58939ca6672f80e02e61f80bb8bc41d0.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-17T15:44:57+00:00","modified":"2020-03-16T21:46:58+00:00","filename":"58939ca6672f80e02e61f80bb8bc41d0.jpg","authentication":"2db3b89872da55a3f38adc8b7e05cbb9","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_Art_Grider_Descriptions_00018_o2.jpg","size":1533384,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3600,"resolution_y":2262,"compression_ratio":0.0627674624226350064137847084566601552069187164306640625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120628"],"TimeCreated":["093741+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120628"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120628"],"TimeCreated":["093741+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120628"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120628"],"TimeCreated":["093741+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120628"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"58939ca6672f80e02e61f80bb8bc41d0.jpg","FileDateTime":1521301480,"FileSize":1533384,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3600\" height=\"2262\"","Height":2262,"Width":3600,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"45mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:10:25 15:46:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":154},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:28 09:37:41","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:28 09:37:41","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":23,"SubSecTimeDigitized":23,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":6881,"ExifImageLength":4324,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":946,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/946","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Another of their Ancient Religious Rites yet practiced by them are DANCES by Men, all of them wearing false faces or MASKS.

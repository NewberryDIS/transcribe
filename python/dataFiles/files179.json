Feb. 26 1850\nMi ch\u00e8r soeur Abbie:\nI have just come from our\nlittle resist meeting. Annie is writing home and she\nsays I must.

Thanks to our\nFather in Heaven for preserving him through such\ntrials and dangers. I think he now has encountered\nthe worst; at least until he returns home again. I think\nhis sickness must have occurred nearly at the same time we\nwere sick at home last fall. Perhaps had he been at home he\nwould have been just as sick. I hope mother does\nnot feel so sadly now. Tell her she mus'nt. Brighter\ndays are in store for us, when we will all meet at\nhome again.\nI received a letter of [illegible] Mrs. Martha To Barton\nLast week; she wrote that she and her husband should go\nto San Francisco, California, probably in the spring.\nI do think is presumption for her to think of it.\nShe is so delicate constitution.

Some of the young ladies assist her. Our dear Miss Chapin\nreturned last evening. Oh! Weren't we glad to see her. [I yours?] we were. We have\ntwo nice teachers this term. Miss Ainsworth & Miss Emma [Budvin?]. Miss Bis the music\nteacher. There are three choirs. We meet four evenings in a week. We have sung\nfrom the [Carmina?] and the Psaltery so far. I wish I had brought ours. Prof. Adams\nof Amhurst is giving lectures in Chemistry this year. I want very much to attend\nbut can't possibly get the time. I keep still about what I am doing for fear they\nwill not let me go on with them all. St. Valentine's day has passed; Did Cupid's dart\nfly any at Warwick? And whose poor heart received a shock? Annie had the most\ncomical Valentine I ever saw. The offer was from a bachelor. She thought she\nshould weept. Abby you must not let your drooping spirits sink you into oblivion\nbecause the gentleman did not carry you to the sleigh ride. I presume he is\nsorry before now. Love is all the deeper after a [illegible] - I fear yet ere I\ncan emerge from the literary temple dedicated to \"extra work and domestic\naffairs,\" my poor sister's heart will indeed be stolen. And perhaps well skilled\nin darning the gent's stockings and patching trouserloons. For me I have linked\nmyself with Cornelius Nepos with a heart like the [rock?] of adamant But enough of this\nOnly don't let good looks deceive you. Now pleas to Maria and Sweeter tell her\nmust write to me soon - Give my love to all our dear ones and tell them\nI think of them each day. Especially at 8 o'clock in the evening. And then I want you\nto think of me. We are then in our little [illegible] meeting. Annie & Carrie send\nto you. They would both write a note but have not the time. Abby I send\nyou this song I copied from Carries list. I think it a sweet thing.

I do think I\nhave subdued them some however,\n[written along the left-hand side of the page]\nTis nine weeks tomorrow Charles since you and I parted at the Depot. Does it not seem an age almost? I have I suppose three weeks more to stay and then Providence permitting will we meet again - Mr. Jackson is not going to Warwick next Sabbath. He goes to Winchendon - but the sabbath after he will go to expect and then you must write me again - you don't know how much good your letter did me - Mrs. Sherman said if you know how much good your letters did me you would write every day. Give my love to mother - I hope some of the flowers will bloom for me when I return. Tell Chandler I don't think hard a bit that he don't write me more. I know just how it is - But the few lines he did write did me a deal of good I wish he would write a line or two at least every day time you write - Tell him the bashfulness of a certain person is no more than I expected - I received a letter from that quarter last week all right - Give my love to [him &] David I hav'nt heard a word from him Warwick is increasing in population fast I should think. You will have stores in plenty. I have heard a new story about the English Girl. Have you? I'll take your advice about going out alone and without rubbers. Though there is no danger at present of my falling up here. What a deal of rainy weather we're having. It has rained almost every day. Never mind the melons Charles we'll have some together next year perhaps. Yes indeed your letter was worth all the water-melons I ever saw. But once more good bye\nI shall see you all again soon I hope and then I will tell all the rest\nLove to all sis Mary","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":41572,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/41572","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b9dc4dbd2f2224471a6993df78051ec5.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b9dc4dbd2f2224471a6993df78051ec5.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b9dc4dbd2f2224471a6993df78051ec5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b9dc4dbd2f2224471a6993df78051ec5.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T19:30:31+00:00","modified":"2020-04-08T16:45:19+00:00","filename":"b9dc4dbd2f2224471a6993df78051ec5.jpg","authentication":"16236a7f5d1ef4ce4e4788c21406a0b2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_057_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1198404,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2227,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049826373297411},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["024620"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["024620"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["024620"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b9dc4dbd2f2224471a6993df78051ec5.jpg","FileDateTime":1509391305,"FileSize":1198404,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2227\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2227,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:02 10:03:44","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:01 02:46:20","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:01 02:46:20","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1957,"ExifImageLength":3163,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":179,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/179","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"But they require constant and careful\ntraining yet.

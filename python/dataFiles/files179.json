Chandler went to buy a great-iron kettle.\nSome masons are coming tomorrow to pet two kettles and\nbuild a chimney and were in the backroom. They've been plastering James house to-day. O!

Feb. 26 1850\nMi ch\u00e8r soeur Abbie:\nI have just come from our\nlittle resist meeting. Annie is writing home and she\nsays I must. I received y'r interesting and cheering\nletter the 19th and never was news so joyful reach-\ned as it contained. Charles has then reached the de-\nsired spot! Well, too, and cheerful! Oh! Thanks to our\nFather in Heaven for preserving him through such\ntrials and dangers. I think he now has encountered\nthe worst; at least until he returns home again. I think\nhis sickness must have occurred nearly at the same time we\nwere sick at home last fall. Perhaps had he been at home he\nwould have been just as sick. I hope mother does\nnot feel so sadly now. Tell her she mus'nt. Brighter\ndays are in store for us, when we will all meet at\nhome again.\nI received a letter of [illegible] Mrs. Martha To Barton\nLast week; she wrote that she and her husband should go\nto San Francisco, California, probably in the spring.\nI do think is presumption for her to think of it.\nShe is so delicate constitution. Her brother writes\nhome very flattering accounts and wishes them to come\nAbby, you have closed yr school. I should think\nyou would be glad I wish you went home. Chandler also\n[written sideways across the page]\nTell mother not to worry one wand about me for I am doing nicely. I think I may\ncommence Calisthenes next week. The time for changing rooms will be soon. I do not know\ncertainly where we shall go. Annie wants to go into the winy. We may not room \ntogether. I don't know. Mr. Stoddard, the intended husband of Miss Huzen, addressed us\na few nights ago. He is a very fine man indeed. I do not wonder she loves him. She is preparing for her journey now. Some of the young ladies assist her. Our dear Miss Chapin\nreturned last evening. Oh! Weren't we glad to see her. I guess we were. We have\ntwo nice teachers this term. Miss Ainsworth & Miss Emma Boudoin. Miss B. is the music\nteacher. There are three choirs. We meet four evenings in a week. We have sung\nfrom the Carmena and the Psaltery so far. I wish I had brought ours. Prof. Adams\nof Amhurst is giving lectures in Chemistry this year. I want very much to attend\nbut can't possibly get the time. I keep still about what I am doing for fear they\nwill not let me go on with them all. St. Valentine's day has passed; Did Cupid's dart\nfly any at Warwick? And whose poor heart received a shock? Annie had the most\ncomical Valentine I ever saw. The offer was from a bachelor. She thought she\nshould weept. Abby you must not let your drooping spirits sink you into oblivion\nbecause the gentleman did not carry you to the sleigh ride. I presume he is\nsorry before now. Love is all the deeper after a Tunnel - I fear yet ere I\ncan emerge from the literary temple dedicated to \"extra work and domestic\naffairs,\" my poor sister's heart will indeed be stolen. And perhaps well skilled\nin darning the gent's stockings and patching trouserloons. For me I have linked\nmyself with Cornelius Nepos with a heart like the rock of adamant But enough of this\nOnly don't let good looks deceive you. Now please to Maria and Sweeter tell her she\nmust write to me soon - Give my love to all our dear ones and tell them\nI think of them each day. Especially at 8 o'clock in the evening.

A little bashful about expressing her opinion.  A blush is all she has bestowed. \nCarrie's health is improving. She is quite an adept in domestic affairs. Poor thing!

And I think they were a little better than usual too. Or else I felt better. Yes Charles I am myself some better than at first - I don't know whether I have disturbed them or whether I am more familiar with them, that my scholars seem less troublesome.

Does it not seem an age almost? I have I suppose three weeks more to stay and then Providence permitting will we meet again - Mr. Jackson is not going to Warwick next Sabbath. He goes to Winchendon - but the sabbath after he will go to expect and then you must write me again - you don't know how much good your letter did me - Mrs. Sherman said if you know how much good your letters did me you would write every day. Give my love to mother - I hope some of the flowers will bloom for me when I return. Tell Chandler I don't think hard a bit that he don't write me more. I know just how it is - But the few lines he did write did me a deal of good I wish he would write a line or two at least every day time you write - Tell him the bashfulness of a certain person is no more than I expected - I received a letter from that quarter last week all right - Give my love to [him &] David I hav'nt heard a word from him Warwick is increasing in population fast I should think. You will have stores in plenty. I have heard a new story about the English Girl. Have you? I'll take your advice about going out alone and without rubbers. Though there is no danger at present of my falling up here. What a deal of rainy weather we're having. It has rained almost every day. Never mind the melons Charles we'll have some together next year perhaps. Yes indeed your letter was worth all the water-melons I ever saw.

High, Intermediate and\nPrimary. I don't know yet what they are to be\nbut I guess Franklin Medals like those\nused in the city. There will be 20 Dollars a year\nexpended for the purpose. I think that a\nvery good appropriation. The prizes are to be\npresented once a year to those scholars who have the\nhighest mark for Department, Punctuality, and\nScholarship. You spoke about my school being\nnearly half out, I have been here just four weeks\nnow, I don't know exactly how long this term\nwill be but I guess about 12 weeks. And\nthat will take till nearly the 1st of July. You ask\nwhere I board. I boarded the first day at the\nHotel! for they could not find a place anywhere.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":41577,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/41577","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f7c9e1900c31cebd677dfc605d427595.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f7c9e1900c31cebd677dfc605d427595.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f7c9e1900c31cebd677dfc605d427595.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f7c9e1900c31cebd677dfc605d427595.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T19:30:47+00:00","modified":"2020-05-20T02:53:19+00:00","filename":"f7c9e1900c31cebd677dfc605d427595.jpg","authentication":"4f856f2c7bab7023c16f1eb7a565f3d9","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_057_006_003_o2.jpg","size":1532772,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2787,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05092333452936299853508472779139992780983448028564453125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["024645"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["024645"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["024645"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f7c9e1900c31cebd677dfc605d427595.jpg","FileDateTime":1509391305,"FileSize":1532772,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2787\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2787,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:02 10:03:56","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333332999803833018859222647733986377716064453125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:01 02:46:45","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:01 02:46:45","ShutterSpeedValue":4.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":6,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2323,"ExifImageLength":3000,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":179,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/179","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I am now at Mr. William Ruggles.

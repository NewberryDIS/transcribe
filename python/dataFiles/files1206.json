The water is of a most beautiful blue and exceedingly cold.  The guide of the sailors at night is to draw up a bucket full and tests its temperature by the hand.  If cold they are in the gulf - if warm they are not.\nI have read of the blue ocean - its tinted waters but have not believed half the stories - attributing much to the imagination of voyagers.  Water looks blue in the distance - but to have it of the most beautiful blue around you - near you and under you had not entered into my conceptions.  The little waves in a particular position reflect a most exquisite tint - a deep and delicate blue - vying seemingly with beautiful blue of the ocean overhead.  The water looked as if coloured with indigo - and I could not but help imagining how well it answer the washerwomen as rinse-water.  They would rejoice in so vast and inexhaustible a supply.\nBut there is another beauty in the Gulf Stream - and that is its foam as created by the paddles of the ship.  Milk in its purist state is not whiter or clearer - its sparkles and rolls over the blue underwater in beautiful contrast.  This exceeding whiteness is owing in part to the blueness of the water - but mostly I think to the phosphorous contained in the sea-water.  Indeed this peculiarity of the salt water strikes the observer most forcibly - its phosphorescence.\nI stood last night - leaning over the bulwarks - after the other passengers had deserted the deck - watching this beautiful appearance of the sea.  Its development consists mostly in sparks of globules of light, as the water is disturbed - but the illumination is more general - when the bow sends a line of foam - dashing from the side.\nFrom the stern - as the water was thrown up by the whirls - it seemed as if millions of pearls were shining in the deep.

The method of carting first struck my attention.  The carts are small and the platform extends beyond in over the wheels.  The jacks being small also - gave the whole the appearance of boys play more than anything else.  Nevertheless the loads were large considering the nature of the establishment.\nThe next thing was the negroes themselves.  For colour they exceeded all artificial black - and then dress was simply a pair of trousers light at the waist.  There were no half bloods nothing less than the real Congo.  Their persons thus exposed to the sun and air - no doubt was cooler show if covered yet I thought the direct rays of the sun must have effect.  The perspiration rolling down - made their backs shine like glass bottles.\nPassing several corners - we came into a square in which was a small park.  There was a fountain at the side of the street - and over the wall a garden - rich in tropical trees.  There was my first sight of the Cabbage tree - which grows up very tall - the trunk is barrell form - and the foliage is a tuft at the top - the faruit a small berry growing like the grape.  Here also was my first sight of the plantain  It resembles much our swamp ferns - only of gigantic size.\nWe went into a little farther and entered a very Celebrated Cafe called La Dominican.

There alas is a beautiful Plaza - intersected with winding roads - and it is the favourite resort of the ladies in the afternoon.  The ladies here never walk - this being considered indelicate - but they have a peculiar looking vehicle called the Volante - in which they do their shopping - visiting - and take their airings.  It is drawn by a mule or horse - which is ridden by a negro.  No phills an about 16 foot long - this with the spring which sustains the seat makes it one of the easiest of carriages.  The negroes manage their volantes very adsoitly - such a long tail behind would comprise a Yankee driver - as it is by no means certain that places and corners - which are accessable to the jackass - and so to the carriage.  Another thing which makes calculation in turning neccessary is the exceeding narrowness of the streets.  These volantes can only pass by an inch or two - and the least varying would cause them to come in contact - as for turning round that is impossible.  I suppose the final cause of making the streets so narrow is - to give the inhabitants always a go ahead habit.\nThe ladies never leave their carriage to shop.

The day was not of the right sort.  We saw however large flocks of Turkey Buzzards.  There are the Scavengers of the South and they are so useful that the laws protects their lives.  They are a large sluggish bird - one of their habits I noticed was - when at rest - to stretch their wings and bat the wind sway then back and forwards.\nOn the west bank about 40 miles from the river stands fort Jackson.  It is a circular form - and above the mason work earth making green surround - over the top of the fort.  The huge cannon lay on the embankment - with their mouths open towards us.  The grounds around are well arranged - and covered with the green grass look very agreeable.  Near the fort and parting the water are the barracks - a large though old fashioned building.  Nearly opposite stands a smaller fort - and these two are the Ceibesus of the river.\nThe water was very high - having overflowed the banks.  I saw shrubs - and fences - stood up out of the water - and houses were surrounded or inundated.  It was like the swellings of Jordan.\nThe Levy - which now is applied to several objects - belongs property to the embankment - which keeps the river within bounds.  On the Mississippi - more especially the part we saw - this mound is small - it runs along both banks and extends some 600 miles.  Every planter by law is obliged to keep up the levy on his own plantation.  It was singular to see the water higher then the land. -\nOur Friends were very polite to give me the names of things as we passed.  The trees were the strangers to me.  Here I saw the first Palm Tree.  It was solitary and alone and only a visitor to this Country like myself.  The Pecan nut tree grew plentifully - being a native of Louisiannia.

The hills advanced nearer and the level looked drier and more capable of cultivation.  Saw many little hovels - belonging I presume to fishermen or poor people - a little patch of a garden - a little strip of fence - completed the residence.

Only the single word liberty was wanting to complete their happiness.\nWhat most delighted me was the orange groves which we passed very often.  They are a small tree - but of very good shape and the foilage of the deepest greeen.  Many were covered with fruit and blossoms the odours of which were wafted to us by the breeze.  The fragrance of the orange bloom is sweetest of the sweet.\nAbout 3 o'clock we arrived at the plantation of Mr     and our friends took their departure.  They descended into the small boats - and waving their adieus were pulled to the shore.  The Father stood upon the Levy - and the negroes hasten in droves down to the water to welcome the comers.  Miss    eyes glistened as she neared her home from which she had been absent about a year - and her face was all joy and animation as she recognised her father - and prepared to land.  I almost enjoyed her joys - they were so sincere and heartfelt.\nThey stood upon the bank until our boat started again.  And then we parted with cheers and waving of handkerchiefs.  I was much amused by Mr Morse - who is quite an excitable man and had enjoyed the voyage - he stood swinging his hat to the huzzas - when as if to give emphasis to his cheer - so to get up a stite higher express - and of his feelings - at the last parting round away sailed his hat some 6 or 8 feet into the air.

What are you all standing about for - I have all this to do alone!\"  In vain we assured him it was unneccessary labour.  \"No!  We were a Company organised to work - and work we must - we should find something to do!

One fellow gloriously drunk in the cabin - was unconscious of the departure of his companions - and showed likely to remain so during the remainder of the day.  It was near five o'clock when gushing up our travelling bags and small articles - our party went over the side.  Bidding adieu to Capt Thompson, and his Lady and his Lady: Sister - we shoved off - and giving three parting cheers to the noble Falcon steered for the landing.\nHere full of hope - and enthusiasm were we.

It was hidden on the left by a bluff - high point - upon whose summit stood the Fort - a venerable pile of ruins - overgrown with mosses and running vines.  The round sentry boxes - as the angles of the walls and overhanging the ocean - mouning sullenly at the dizzy depth below - filled the minds with pictumsyre ideas.  The sentilned pacing the walls - in the the still dark night - listening for sounds inimical - the indications of the coming enemy - or during the storm - driven within his base - puring from its crevice window - fancying danger in every voice of the wind - every sullen moan of the heaving oceans - or drawing his coat closer round - with thoughts transported for away to the sunny hills of Chatile and dreaming his boyhoods days over again.\nThe mouth of the river was indicated with several vessells - wrecked on the rufs - over which the waves broke with yeasty foam - beyond them was the right band of the river - on which one house was visible - several palm trees - and woods in the distance.\nNo sooner were we discovered by the morning light then boats began to come out from the shore.  They were seeking passengers at the moderate price of six dollars per man.  The sea was unusually calm.  The Captain soon ordered his boat alongside and taking the ships papers - and the committee on the part of the passengers - went on shore.\nFor me nothing was to be done but loiter around the vessell - and amuse myself to the best advantage.  Admire the shore passport - watch the boats - and the bringus now landing ready to proceed up the river - or notice the scen passing in our own ship.  A sudden change had come over the spirit of its dreams.  The hatches were unclosed - boxes - bags and trunks strewn about the deck - men busy here and there looking up their baggage or discharging it over the side.  all was confusion and turmoil - a Babel would let loose upon the ship.\nAs was that morning scene on the ship - so is human life - the world - a scene of hurrying strife - and selfish effort.

There are some Indians whose long-black hair forms a distinctive mark - among the curly locks of the blacks.  I did not have an opportunity of crossing and visiting the town.  The general landscape was interesting.  Hills formed the frame of the picture.  They rose - covered with trees - green and leafs.  The river like a silver thread wound away till lost in an abrupt angle.  Flowing amid low banks which could not be seen on account of the foliage - with flowers - and branches drooping into the water - it seemed a tiny stream flowing through a garden.  Near me was the landing which was simply the rivers bank - with several vessels alongside - and the landing itself covered with people - and baggage.  All busy. Natives were paddling and repaddling [ains?] the river.  Toward the north - was the ocean - limiting the horizon with the line of these - The Falcon lay on its swell riding at anchor nearer a schooner - was tacking and retacking trying to get in.  The most picturesque object in the scene was the old fort - in its high nest on the rocky point.  A few cannon still pointed their hollow ends from the Embrasres - some had fallen down the height and lay imbeded in the sand beach below.  The crumbling wall - the missing gates - the high cracks - the worn stones spoke of decay and brighter days gone by.  One is recalled to the machko men who built the mission [structure] forts - of the extensive policy of the Spaniard which the whole southern America with its military structures - and planted its laws and religion - among the savage inhabitants.  When have passed their days - where is the proud Spain - who once filled these forts with soldiery - by whose command the sentinel paced these dreary walls - and whose past enterprize is evidenced by his language being engrafted upon the people.  She is fallen.  They are past their days - they are all gone by - and she lies like that old fort - a mass of ruins.\nWe slept on board the Anes - the first steamboat which disturbed these placid waters - and she through American enterprise.  We found in even this early stage of the Emigration to California - conveniences springing up with mushroom activity - for travelling.

We saw the place and an exclamation of surprise burst from all lips.  Behind the rocky point on the left banks of the river - was situated this tropical town.  To me it was novel - singular - grotesque.  We landed on the opposite bank - and went on board the Steamboat Clrus.  The Americans were with true Gomkuism - turning to account the hidden and new route of travel.  Two or three tents had been pitched upon which hung signs - bearing names of some of our best hotels in the States.  We found the Falcon's passengers - busy some preparing for the night - others loading boats - ready for a start against the morrow - others sauntering about - looking at the scenery.\nOur sportsman (Stone) was instantly off with his rifle.  He found nothing worthy of his fire - when lo! a large bird comes and settles himself very much at ease within distance.  Elate with sight of so noble gain - Stone draws up - fires and kills his game - but approaching to carry off his prize - he drops it quickly on inhaling its stron perfume - his expectations and his fun pushing together.  He had shot a turkey buzzard.\nSeated on the deck of the Ams - in the twilight time I had ample opportunity to view Chagre - and its attendant scenery.  The town is on the low bank of the river - while immediately back of it rose high hills.  It consists of some fifty or sixty dwellings - without order or regularity - the only distinctive building being one bearing on its ridge the sign St Charles..  To one not accustimed to tropical scenes - the town appears very singular.  The houses are so inferior looking - and built without any reference to either beauty or convenience - so totally different from anything seen before - that one is surprised.  It was owing to this, joined to the glowing opinions formed from the newspapers of the great city of Chagres - that exclamations which burst from our party as we rounded the point.  The contrast was - vivid and strange.\nChagres belongs to the republic of New Granada - is situated on a river bearing the same name - which rises among the mountains and makes a throughfare for half the distance across the Isthmus.  It lies on the east bank of the river and is hemmed in behind with high hills.  Its inhabitants are chiefly negroes - who follow boating on the river.

I could not help feeling it was but play sailing up it we were boys sporting along a beautiful stream - full of delight with its miniature beauties.  Then was all the refinements of nuture bade - uncontrasted with anything huge or sublime.  It was a fairy creation like the carvings of a rich moulding - or the ornaments of a Gothic structure.  The fragments of a munum - calling only the remembrance of the whole of which they represented a part.\nThe scenery was easy - felt as a glance - enjoyed in each passing moment.\nWe passed several houses - situated on the banks.  They looked pleasant.  After a run of seventeen miles - our boat had proceeded as far as the river would allow.  She drew up by the banks - at a small settlement called Indian Village.\nWe were here to be transferred to bringies.  Great was the turmoil of the crowd and haste - for who ever saw travellers and especially Americans that were not always stiring to be first.  Now was the fact of difference of language.  Any help to the fast passengers.  There was no use of scolding - fretting or swearing - the patient boatsman could not understand a word.  How I felt again the pleasing position of belonging to a company.  Some being left to perform all the common laborer - and some running anxious to seek other interests than personal pleasure.  I believe the seeds of dissolution were deeply sown in most of the California Companies - during their journey to that country.  Endless dissensions - heart burnings - jealousies and recriminations - marred all peace and enjoyment.  I was much amused during the passage up by an incident which occured to the elder Kaskins - and it was too so consonant with the character of the man.  Always anxious about the public property - and fearful of loss - he must needs overhaul a portion of it during the passage up.  During the midst of the overhauling the boat shot under some trus and there was a cracking and pulling of the branches - we all cried out and ran from under - but Haskins was too intent on his bag - thinking perhaps none of them had a right to endanger him.  We called to him but he paid no regard - when on the instant down came a large branch leveling him completely.  I thought he was killed but he regained his feet and was quickly absorbed again in his work.  He saw none of the beauties others saw.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":93076,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/93076","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d133e67de00ef5b3e1443ccbb6c3d888.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d133e67de00ef5b3e1443ccbb6c3d888.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d133e67de00ef5b3e1443ccbb6c3d888.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d133e67de00ef5b3e1443ccbb6c3d888.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-10T22:43:50+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:51:32+00:00","filename":"d133e67de00ef5b3e1443ccbb6c3d888.jpg","authentication":"d686845b14c6ed2da6778ef2e4703f43","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3139_00031_o2.jpg","size":946125,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1843,"resolution_y":2222,"compression_ratio":0.077011906291009}},"item":{"id":1206,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1206","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"4\nOur night quarters were on the promenade deck.

Then was a novelty in our situation - which kept us in good humour.  And we fell asleep - under the ceasing hum of the crowd and the music of insects on the distant hill.  The night was cool - owing to the heavy full of dew.\nAt early dawn we were aroused by preparations for departure.  The smoking pipe the clang of the bell - the shuffling of passengers - were familiar sounds.  By 5 o'clock we were off.  All were on the \"qui vive\" to enjoy the scenery.  And truly it was beautiful.  The low banks - soon gave place to higher.  The hills began to slope from the river - and show their huge sides - now thinly and now more thickly studded with scions of the forest.\nThe course of the river is very tortuous - so that every few minutes - a new turn - displayed a new vista of landscape.  How beautiful!  how lovely! is not this charming were exclamations often on our life.  And surely we were in situation to enjoy summer scenery - having so lately escaped poor rigid scenes of Winter. And Summer too in a region - where nature is prodigal in her gifts - and the vegetative world riots in luxuriance.  we passed several canoes paddling down.  Some we hailed and took them in tow.  The Captain amused us with our account of the action of the natives - during the first trips of the Anus.  Their astonishment at her spade - their fear of her - instantly paddling to shore on her coming in sight - and waiting will she had passed.  They firmly believed she could shout over the shallows and the rocks - and nothing was imppossible to the fire boat.\nFeeling the calls of hungry nature - I went to our stores and breakfasted on Boston Crackers and Bologne Sausages.  This was a point not in keeping with things around - yet it was one of those points which belong to a travellers condition - However uncomely - they are the punctuation marks in his sketch book.\nOur little craft shot along rapidly.  some of the turns were so short whe with difficulty escaped the opposite shore - one she missed her aim and ran headlong among the branches of the trees.

Hundred of pounds of silver has been brought down by them without the least guard.  It is down the river that the metal of the Chilian and Tenivian mined finds its way to the Eastern Continent.  The British Steamers from Valpraiso bring it to Panama - while the British West India Steamers receive it at Chagres and convey it from thence.\nWe found progrission in our bungie slow in comparison with the swift and smooth glide of the Onis.  It was not unpleasant however our only annoyance being the roll side ways of our craft.  We hoisted our umbrellas - for the sun was hot, and kept our eyes intent on the scenery opening constantly upon our view.  Let all travellers in tropical climates provide themselves with umbrellas - and never go aboard without them.  Whether for protection against the burning sun or the heavy showers, which the rainy season pour down - they are invaluable to the traveller.  No sooner had our boatmen started than they divested themselves of all clothing - tying their breaches loosily around their waists.  This I found was out of decency before our women - as most of them go entirely naked.  We found the banks of the river presenting a luxuriance of beauty.  Their flatness at the commencement - had now given way to undulating variety - and covered with trees many of them new and strange.  There was one variety particularly that was abundent - tall and its branches thickly studded with scarlet flowers - in bunches like the lilac - others bore purple blooms.  How the cocounut tree attracted my eyes.  The first I ever saw - though its fruit has always been favorite with me.  The Plantain with broad fern like leaf - its top drooping over like a willow - oaks with their rough and wide spread arms.  I tried to learn the names of the trees and shrubs from our Neptunes - but could not understand their Spanish.\nIn the afternoon we stopped at a hous or ranch as the natives call it.

The calling of almost every man may be discerned in his travelling habits.  The merchant is always looking over his bills - the offic seeker is in the barbers room talking politics - the exquisite is on the prominade talking and flirting with ladies - and the stupid - souless man is smoking on the forward deck or sleeping in the cabin.  How few catch the passing beauties as they fly - and feed a thirsting taste!\nIt was twelve o'clock M ere we were ready to start up the river.  Our company and luggage had been distributed into four boats my lot fell to the one carrying our Directors family.  It had been provided with a shelter consisting of hoops stretched across and thatched with palm leaves - for the protection of Mrs Newcomb.  We placed a bed beneath the shelter and embarked our party consisting of Dr N - wife - daughter - boy Tommy - Servant woman and myself.  My spirits were light as we shoved from the steamboat - and commenced a trip - which promised both novelty and pleasure.\nThe Chagres River as I have said before constituted - a considerable portion of the thoroughfare across the Isthmus.  The transportation is carried on by boats called bungies - and the distance sailed is 46 miles.  It is by the boatmen that the towns on the river are principally inhabited - no cultivation of the soil - or other employments - being seen on this portion of the Isthmus.  A bungie is a large canoe.  It is formed from a single log - from a tree resembling mahogany - and is of uncouth appearance - rough and imwieldy.  There are many sizes of them - that in which we embarked was some 20 ft long - by 3 troude.  To impel them along two natives stand in the box - on a short board platform - with setting poles - while a third steers.  They keep near the banks - in order to have bottom - to use their poles.  Thus pacing their short platform the boatmen toil the livelong day without remark - complaint - or cessation.  As a people they are patient - kind and inviolably honest.  They do not like to be urged - and in fact cannot be driven.  They drink but little spirits, yet never refuse it - if the passinger offers it.  Our boatmen had nine with them.  They smoke much.  The offer of cigars and tobacco is very acceptable.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":93079,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/93079","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/9e88093580879a59512cd637b5519512.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/9e88093580879a59512cd637b5519512.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/9e88093580879a59512cd637b5519512.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9e88093580879a59512cd637b5519512.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-10T22:43:52+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:51:32+00:00","filename":"9e88093580879a59512cd637b5519512.jpg","authentication":"832a93301baf8d419e1110c711a0487e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3139_00033r_o2.jpg","size":957483,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1823,"resolution_y":2223,"compression_ratio":0.078756006434501}},"item":{"id":1206,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1206","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"11\nscreams of the monkey and catamount - being weaned I soon fell asleep. -\nAbout 3 o'clock was wakened to stand my turn in the watch.  The air was heavy with moisture - the night dull and leaden.  I took the gun and felt dismal enough.  Daylight soon appeared - and with it the rising of the travellers - and preparations for departure.  Out ladies complained much of the filthiness of the ranch and of the fluid - an invariable concomotanet of all Spanish ranches.  A bowl of muddy coffee - apologized for breakfast and we set forth.   The sun was just rising - and never shall I forget the beauty of that morning scene.  We were in the most beautiful part of Chagres River.  The river was full of curves - the banks bloomed with richest vegetative - loveliness.  The sky was robed with gorgeous clouds.  Around - above all was beauty.  \nThe Toucan flew from tree to tree - his gaudy plumage glancing in the sun - countless pairs of paraquets went fluttering - and creaming over our heads.  The King Birds also and many an unknown song came from the woods - full of melody.\nThen splendid tufts of scarlet blooms - still lay ginbosomed in the umbrageous green - while many a smaller - though not less lovely blosom caught our eyes.  Now and then - shone a guady parasite - rich in colour - with its laner bears armed with hooks - hanging pendant from the branches of some old tru -  We saw quite a variety of these parasites and certainly they gear gorgeous blooms.\nOur boatmen were very loyuacious - indeed they talked much among themselves - seeming to enjoy themselves.  They took the morning sugar - which I offered with a \"muchias gratias\" - smoking and passing them round.  They carry always their trider bon - which consists of flint steel and a bit of candle Mcking.\nThe only animals we saw - was an alligator some 12 feet in length which lay sleeping in the sun on the bank.  A noise started him and he slid quickly into the water.  This river abounds with alligators.  The boatmen are much afraid of them - they assured me several times it would be \"mucho malo\" with me if I fell into the water.  We saw also a large iguana.

We could get no idea of distance - our boatmen only calculating by horns - \"manana - Gorgona\"!\nOn a low sandy point we saw two graves - there were the grave of two unfortunate men - dying while on their passage up.  Our Senors pointed to them - saying sadly - \"Americano - muerto!\"\nWe came to place of which we had had intimation - a fall in the river - of some ten feet.  The water rushed rapidly through the rocks - and dashed over them fearfully.  I felt alarmed when I saw the boiling waters - through which we must force our passage.  Just as we entered our polismen gave a horrid yell which scared me out of my five senses - but in a minute we were through.  It was a yell of now for it - all together.  One of the other boats of our party was not so fortunate as we - for the current swept them around and came within an ace of capsizing.

Their walls were no defence - their gates useless to debar defeat.

It was a rough - winding and steep descent - but at length we reached the plain.  Following up the ravine a little ways we found women engaged in washing - who supplied us with water.  I looked wistefully into some tall cocoanut trees - but the fruit was far beyond my reach.  Had there been monkeys there I should have been tempted to have practised on their bump of imitation.  In our walk homeward we came across an old soldier - who had served in Spain during the times of Napoleon.  He had received a portion of land and employed himself in raising fruits.  He showed us some - part were grown while blooms in other places - had put forth indicating more.  This is one of the singularities of tropical vegetation.  The same tree shows fruit in every stage from the bloom - to the state of ripeness.

Never having seen this animal before - I picked him up on a stick and carried him home for examination.  the natives as I passed seemed greatly surprised - and exclaimed - \"mucho malo - mucho malo\".

These I did not notice till one day going to bathe I discovered eight or ten of them on my companion.  They bury themselves in the skin - head and legs - and acquire considerable skill to pick them out without dismemberment.  I picked my friend when he in his turn picked me.  These ticks gave us no annoyance - except feeling uncomfortable after knowing they were upon us.\nThe chigre is common.  I saw one man pick several sacks of eggs from his feet.  They are not annoying if attended to in [?].  There is a species of lizzard very common - dark colored and lively.  These are seen darting among the shrubs and rocks with great activity.  They are perfectly harmless.

Whatever abhorence the poisonous and annoying insects of tropical countries may be held in - there is no greater curse of pest in the whole insect tribe that will compare with the mosquitoe.  Against all others there is some prospect of alliance - agaist these now.  They are neither to be excaped by care - vigilance - or art.  In spite of everything they still sing - their hateful song in your ear - or plunge their bills into your flesh.

Bananas I found pleasant - although like tomatoes it requires some cultivation of the taste to relish them.  The market boats - loaded with produce - drawn up on the beach - looked somewhat business like.  This place was also the place of landing - from the shipping.  All goods have to be lightered to the shore as there are no docks or pier.  It is almost impossible to get a bungie to go out in - and if one is procured at enormous rates - the passenger is hardly sure of attaining his purpose.\nWe were much amused by one of our men Gregory - a large surly fellow - who notwithstanding dispising to be sick - was unwell most of the time.  He was forbidden by the doctor to eat pine apples - but knowing what agreed with him - still clung to the fruit.  His sickness kept on day after day - but \"no! I know it is not from the pine apples I eat.\"  Finally disinclined to restrain his appetite and finding sympathy growing scarce - he inclined to hide his fruit.  Every morning we could see him returning from the market - with his hunts [?] behind him - and the pine apple snugly hidden in the lee of his huge back.\nParrots and Parroquets - are about the only cage birds I saw in the city.  These are numberous.  They are screaming or jabbering Spanish at almost every door.\nThe finest one I saw was near our quarters.  He had quite a vocabulary of sentences - and one day I was arrested by hearing him singing a regular church chant.  I thought at first the priests were out in some procession - but I soon perceived it was Poll who had assumed the surplice and stole.  At the house of the Alcade opposite was a large Macaw - his plumage was bright and clean - but other than swinging himself about on the rail of the balcony - he possessed no interest.  When the rains commenced there was a general scream among the race of Parrots.  The first shaver I noticed a number of parrots of our neighbors - picking their wings - rumpling their feathers - and swinging upon the branches of a orange shrub whither they had flown.  I sometimes felt annoyed when hearing the birds talking Spanish so glibly - while I could hardly string two words together.  I was almost as much surprised as the Englishman who wrote home from Paris - that such was the education of the Parisians that even small children could talk French fluently.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":93085,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/93085","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/3f41539c08d5c893e9c8cbcaa2955eed.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/3f41539c08d5c893e9c8cbcaa2955eed.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/3f41539c08d5c893e9c8cbcaa2955eed.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3f41539c08d5c893e9c8cbcaa2955eed.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-10T22:43:57+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:51:32+00:00","filename":"3f41539c08d5c893e9c8cbcaa2955eed.jpg","authentication":"76d95b26b2ee35c40f0cd7993cbba7eb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3139_00038r_o2.jpg","size":912796,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1823,"resolution_y":2207,"compression_ratio":0.075624666375534}},"item":{"id":1206,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1206","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"21\nWe remained in Girgona 4 days.  Mrs Newcomb was so sick that we could not proceed without giving her a short respite.  We had reached the Isthmus at a gloomy period.  The most unwelcome news each day arrived from Panama of no steamer - no sail vessel to carry away the many Americans who were no filling up that city.  There was not the least prospect of speedily leaving the Isthmus and being forwarded on our journey to San Francisco.  Our company was in a very unsettled state of feeling - not knowing which was the best course to pursue - hence there was dissensions and pittings - one advising this and another that.  We met several parties returning to Chagres - having become discouraged - and having determined to seek a way overland through Mexico.    \nOur tent was pitched among many others - just above the town - on a bank that in times of high water became an island.  It was a pleasant spot - under the trees - and as I was determined not to annoy myself about company affairs - I found so much more time for enjoyment of the novelties which now surrounded me.\nIt was a delightful four days to me.  I had plenty room for observation - and every sense was greeted with things new and gratifying.\nGirgona is situated upon a high bank of the river and contains some hundred buildings.  These were arranged better than those of Chagres - for there was a plaza - and some semblance of streets.  I found it to contain - one or two hotels - lately opened by Americans.  And a Catholic church.  The only wooden edifice in the place and having the exclusiveness of a tile roof.  The Alcaldi's house - was the only other building worthy of attention and this only from its being a store - bottles renged on the shelves - with various labels indicating their contents being the staple of the assortment.  The scenery around the town - is of the mountainous stamp - woods and scattered trees - with the rapid and narrow river - winding among the hills - being the chief particulars.  It may be proper here - having now seen more of the country and its inhabitants - to describe more minutely - what I saw of their habits and customs - their habitations etc.  I have called their habitations - houses - but this would convey no [pr?] idea to those who are accustomed to American houses.  It might be more proper to call them huts - but they are not even these - but bear a character essentially their own - they are ranches.

They have no great need of money - the fruitful bouth supplies them with food - the warm climate with clothing.  Therefore they do not exert themselves unneccessarily.  They are good natured - kind - and seldom angry.  They will not be hurried in their labour.  They have the moderate gait of the tropics - and pay a deaf ear to all the puttings of us - non stirring men of the temperate climates.\nWe found plenty of society among the Americans who were tented around us.  For our part - every man sought out means of amusement.  The Company's rifle were brought out cleaned and prepared for hunting - the fishing tackle was rigged - to catch the large fish which could be seen playing in the stream - while walks in the woods by the river side and evening strolls to the village employed our leisure time.\nOn the pebbly beach opposite our tent - the women were engaged during the day in washing.  They might be seen in the morning - with their huge wooden bowl - filled with clothes - balanced on their heads - winding their way to the river side.  Little bush bowers protect them from the sun - while the beach served them for a bleaching and drying platform.  It was pleasant to see the native women from the young maid to the old hag - dabbling in the water - some one or other - bathing in the stream - or pouring water on their heads from calabash bowls.  They seemed to enjoy the cooling stream - and instead of shinning the watery drops - courting it as if their washing was only a prolonged bathing.  The women are fond of bathing.  The hardly grown infant - rolling about in the flood with as much gusto as the larger children.  Children of both sexes - wear no clothing.  The women used often to come to our tent to see our Senora - and Senorita.  They were much pleased to see one of their own sex but especially Tommy - the little \"picaninny\".  There was one girl - who was a favourite with us.  She was quite pretty - her round face full of good nature - and her perpetual laugh - bespoke the maid of wisthful and free spirit.  She always had some pleasing remark or observation to make to her companions as she passed through the camp - with her bowl of clothes.\nThe second day of our stay - I went in company with Dr Newcomb - on a shooting excursion.  We anticipated pleasure from a wood ramble though we might not secure any game.  I was a green sportsman - but a hunt in new style of woods - was not an unpleasant prospect.

This comprises the culinary - the sleeping and the visiting arrangements.  It there be an upper story - the height is mounted by means of a notched log.  For culinary purposes a fire - a very small one is made - almost anywhere inside - the fireplace not being stationary - its whole material being but two or three large stones.

So simple is it - that its outfit never discourages - a young couple matrimonially inclined - nor indeed need all which pertains to their housekeep.

Under the sun of the tropics - the inhabitants do not seem inclined to pamper their stomachs - eating is one of their least important pleasures - in employments.  The food in use I found was chiefly - coffee - rice boiled in cocoanut milk - a species of yam called \"eachu\" - and plantains.

They seemed not to know the value of money - would as quietly ask an hundred dollars - for carrying a trunk as five.  None of our party understood Spanish - so that even obliged to make contracts by means of figures and gestures.  Nor was it safe to trust luggage to every carrier.  Some even unable to fulfill what they promised - others would get possession and it would remain at Gorgona - for days after their owners had started - and some had lost their trunks and finds by villians coming out from Panama and claiming them as the carriers arrived.  There was a deplorable state of affairs - on the Isthmus.

Like many streams - mountain streams - in the torrid zone it is subject to great rise of water.  From 25 to 30 ft is the average of its highest rise - during the dry season its depth constantly grows less.  We passed up it during the dry season - consequently the water was at its lowest full.  There are many places rapids as they are called when the depth did not exceed there ful=  In one place - we had all to leave the bringie - in order to get her past.  The natives jumped into the water - and by strict of pulling and poling found their boat along.  The current which is at every place - rapids - is particularly so - in these shallow places.  It requires tact also - to pole a bringie along - as I found out by trail while as Gorgona - and agility.

The strange sights and sounds fading into the ideal until dreams picture forth still more curious things - than wakened sense disclose.  The mind is hardly at rest - slumber seems lost time - a break in the lively chain which binds his thoughts.  The morning comes to give imagination more food for the ensuing night.\nThe stir of the camp at early dawn aroused me.  The carriers were already shouldering their loads - an moving off - mules were being packed - and pedestrians preparing to start.  The anxiety was to make the most of the cool of the morning.  Thirteen miles had been passed and thirteen still remained before travelling.  I found some of our party had already gone forward - taking advantage of the moonlight.  It was an hour before we could get arranged.  Hannah and the servant mounted their nags - the negroes shouldered Mrs Newcomb - and we struck down the rocky path into the woods.  We were overtaken by a party of surveyors going out to their work.  The bore us company awhile.  They complained of the heat - to Americans working - and of the difficulty of the woods - on account of the runners - vines &c.  Indeed passage through them is impossible without a bush knife - to hack ones way.\nWe found the road easier than the preceeding day - not to hilly and smoother.  The heat however was intolerable.  Some places - we found the path worn deep in the soil - so only one man could walk at a time.  I noticed the soil mostly - was to red loam - and somewhat clayey.\nWe went gaily forward.  New shells as we approached the streams - and now flowers by the way side engaged our attention.  Our natives stopped and gathered some of peculiarily pleasant fragrance and gave them to Mrs N.  Many flowers of beautious dyes - and the noble passion flower among the train attracted our eyes.

This tide of emigration was not that of the slow and constant river - but that of a mountain torrent where every drop hurried to outstrip its brother drop.  It was the rush of tumultions waters - just broken over a barrier - speeding with force to its estuary.  Men of every character - every opinion - every profession - every trade mingled in the throng - all alike moved by that stongest of impellants - gold - Gold.  The only thing producing perpetual motion.  And gold was now carrying in its train more benefits ever found before then - even all the benefits of population and civilization.

We were warmly welcomed by this courteous gentleman - who had charge of sountern section of the survey.  We were here introduced to Mr. Nelson - American Consul of Panama - and Mr Stout having in charge - the Pacific Steamers.  We spent three hours - agreeably in the company of these gentleman.\nWe found the Consul in bad humor with the Americans - congregated at Panama.  It seems that they impatient at delay - and fretting unde rthe discouraging prospect of getting forward - troubled him excessively - and continually thronged him - with wants - inquiries and censures.

No wider article then a packed mule.  In croping one of the mountains early in the day I thought from the look of the numerous stones - that we had discovered a portion of this old paved road - but closed examination showed them to be columnar portions of trap rock.  I have concluded - that the mountain was perhaps an old extinct volcanoe.\nHow I wished in my heart Panama would have in sight.  Our indisatigable niggers seemed to walk or half run faster and faster as the road lengthened before us.  From every little rise of ground I strove to catch sight of the city.  At length the wished sight appeared and just over the brow of a rise - the two ancient towers of the cathedral appeared.  Hearty were the hurrahs that welcomed them.  Mrs N raised by our clamor joined her welcome to ours.  The Isthmus was crossed and her life had not been forfeited.  The dreaded journey was nearly done.\nAbout a mile and a half out - we found many Americans camped - but hurrying on - we pressed forward anxious to arrive at our quarters before night.\nWe passed wearily along the wide road now rapidly strewing with houses - passed through the gate - and ended our march at the Hotel Americano.  Now we found our friends that had arrived before us - and all of us looking travel stained and jaded.  It must have been a curious sight to the loungers - the sight of our parties arrival.  First Hannah and the Servant - mounted in mens accoutriments - riding up to the door - and dismounting - then Tommy astride his carriers shoulders - then Mrs N. in her hammock with us armed on either side - and groups of our men arriving in the intervals.  Grotesque would it have been in New York.  And strange enough even in Panama's every day strange scenes.  I have often been amused with witnessing the arrivals and movements of the German and Irish emigrants on our shore - and now I was myself become the source of amusement.  We made odd emigrants - nor were we a whit behind in strangeness and oddities - those I had laughed at so often.\nI had been warming in imagination - as we neared Panama at the idea of beholding the great Pacific Ocean.

We instantly ran into the bushes - the carriers of Mrs N. evincing great alarm.  The cause quickly developed itself.  We saw a wild bull - dashing up the path - in the wildest manner.  It was held by a native - by a rope fastened to his horns - and on following to drive him along.  Suddenly he commenced bellowing - and started forward - the native ahead - running to keep out of his way.  His hat fell off but there was no time for delay - the wild bull was on his heels - maddened by the sight of us and our accoutriments.  I did not know for a moment but we should be attacked - so wild and fierce was the animal - but in a moment - he was past.  Soon after we met a similar animal - but we took the precaution to get entirely out of sight.  I could not but be amused however to see how earnestly the native ran.  They both did not relish the job they were performing.  So that Mr Bull travelled according to his own fancy - now on the full gallop - and now on a walk.  Possibly they intended to use these creatures for packing - as I saw some afterwards who had been broken to this business.\nWe were met by one of our party returning after Tommys horse - another one had been taken ill - and had to give up the journey.  After walking some distance we found him stretched out under a tree by the roadside.  He had been vomiting freely and was completely fatigued out.  Some stimulant and encouragement revived him so that by mounting the horse - and being supported by his companions - he reached the city.  Tommy however by this decident was quite undone - his horse was gone - and the little fellow could not - foot the remaining distance.  We were delivered from our dilemma by hiring a native to carry him.  And now Tommy mounted on the shoulders of his bissed stud - advanced with more exultation than before.\nAt the junction of the Cruces road - we came upon the ancient paved way which once lat between that place and Panama.

It was founded shortly after the discovery of America and became a place of note - from the consideration that it in conjunction with Nombre de Deos - was entripet - for all the wealth of the Spanish colonies on the Pacific Coast.  Before the discovery of Cape Horn - the Isthmus of Darien afforded the only route whereby the spoils obtained by the Spaniards could be transmitted to Europe.  Hence a route across this Glen of the New World - was soon established.  Neither came the adventurers under Cortez - and under the various Spanish leaders - and after crossing the isthmus passed down the coast conquering Equador - Peru - Bolivia and Chili - and passing up the coast - invaded unfortunate Mexico.  The city was founded about the year 1517.  Vasco Nunez de Bilboa - was the first who crossed the Isthmus.  He saw the Pacific with ecstacy and wading into the tide took possession in the name of his master the King of Spain.  The settlement continued to flourish - and \"when burned by the Bucaniers in 1671 consisted of about 12.000 houses many of them large and magnificent.  It contained also eight monasteries and two churches all richly furnished\"  It was rebuilt on its present site and surrounded with walls - to defend it from the Bucaniers - and the English.\nThe appearance of Panama was to me interesting.  Unused to observing the customs and the style of buildings - except of my native land - every thing I saw was full of novelty and fresh ideas.  I was in an old city full of odd buildings - old ruins - quaint customs and curious people.\nThe general impression to the traveller of the town is pleasing.  It is hardly seen in the approach from Chagres - until entered upon.  A wide street - leads ot the town Gate - just without which is a plaza - with a church fronting upon it.  On the right hand - a conical hill of about 600 ft height rises covered with verdure and trees - and flanked with other hills till the view is limited.  This hill is bald - and from the open space waved the New Grenada flag.  It was from this point that Bolivar bombarded the city - and it has received the name therefore of Bolivar's Hill.\nThe city within the walls is not large.

I to see that ocean - the probability of which never entered my thoughts.  Yes I was nearing the western shores of my native continent - and soon this greatest of oceans was to greet my vision.  The old Pacific - the blue Pacific - the sublimely vast Pacific.  Surely the traveller enjoys great luxury in hailing one by one those objects which are known to him - and making realities to his own senses - that which had always been before only idealities.  His spirit expands with every occasion of new ideas - and a knowledge springs up which promises to enliven his future years.  But though eagerly looked for the Pacific did not greet my eyes until we had nearly reached the town gate.  Then on either hand I beheld the blue waters rolling in peaceful swells to the shores.  Twas the ocean - in the distance two mountain islands towered above the expanse of water - two ships lay at anchor at the base of one of them and beyond the clouds drooped and received the ocean into their bosoms.  Yea!  I stood upon the shore of an ocean - whose waters enclose the Fninaly - the Society and the Sandwich Islands - and whose waves - onrolling break upon the shores of Japan and China.  There was nought seperated me from these distant portions of the globe - but this sheet of water I saw before me.  Henceforth I had a personal acquaintance with the Pacific.\nAfter much delay and many vexations we found the lodgings which our committee had provided for us.

Here during the short sunset and twilight - when the land breeze breathes freshness through the sultry air - the inhabitants repair to walk and enjoy the beauty of the scene.  And truly the view is splendid.  Before the eye opens the noble bay - at its farther bound the fleecy clouds receive the waters - and hide them in their breasts.  The distant mountain islet and its larger companion Toboga - covered with green verdure - sleep on the expanse of lively blue.  The ships in port ride tranquilly at their anchors - their canvass wings folded on their towering masts.

The grim defences of early days - when seiges - and assualts tried the soldiers skill and courage - when draw bridge and porticullers shelt all within.  My imagination peopled these ruined battlements again - and the excitements of assault and repulse.  Strategy and defeat - mine and countermine were shadowed out.\nBut Panama at the present day is eminently a city of ruins.  The mould of decay and the tooth of envious Time - have made sad havoc in her streets.  Every house bears marks of age - and most of her churches - are heaps of heterogeneous ruins.  She has outlived the times and the causes which created and made her a city.  Spain her foster mother has fallen - her commerce gone - her people enervated - her colonies urested from her - the enterprize of the world has passed into their hands and into their channels - and with her has Panama fallen - possibly never to be resuscitated.  It is this ruined and old appearance of the city that first arrests the traveller.  He finds himself in a stagnated place.  The streets are regular - but narrow - rough and paved with small stone.  The houses are built of stones - and plastered smooth on the outside.  A heavy piazza or balcony is affixed to the second floor.  The roofs are of tile.  The lower story is used only for stores - shops &c.  The doorways are large.  The second floor is the living part.  The rooms are large - the roof serves for a ceiling and huge white washed partitions divide the apartments.  The windows open on the balcony.  The stair cases are stone - and the lower hall wide and roomy - generally opening into a court.  There are no fire places.  Cooking is done in the courts.  Here a box filled with earth and raised on legs - serves to sustain the neccessary fire.  Very little cooking is done in tropical climates.  Prof Leibey would account for this by stating people in hot climates need but little carbon.  The houses are build with reference to the heat.  The rooms are large and spacious - and placed on the second floor to get all the circulation possible.  Sashes are not used at all.  The windows on the ground floor are usualy grated.  Without the walls - the buildings are principally the bamboo huts.  The general appearance of the houses is clumsy and cumbersome.  The principal street of the city - the Calle de San Antonio - runs direct from the gate of entrance - to the opposite side - and ends by a gate upon the beach.  The principal plaza is upon this street - as also the Hotel Americano and th Hotel Franicais.  The noblest part of Panama is the garrison at the angle of the wall - facing the sea.

The principal articles sold are jerked beef - pork -beans - corn - barley - eggs - cocoa - banana - plantain - euca - oranges - limes pine apples &c.  The women attended the stalls.  They are dull salesmen - scarcely paying enough attention to answer purchasers questions.  The market bungies are huge canois:  moved by sails or by long sweeps.  In rowing - the man whose seat is high - rises, moves forward dips his oar and settles with the motion back to his seat.  The island of Tobaga [Taboga] furnishes the market.  It is distant some 6 miles.\nNear the market is the Governor's House - a gloomy old house.  The court dirty and piles with goods - being used as a storage by the merchats.  He has a country residence a few miles from the city - where his family generally remain.  Adjoining the Governo's is the Custom House - and Post Office.  These places indicate little business.  Most of the commerce of Panama consist in shipments received - it having little to offer in exchange for its imports.  The coffee - flour - nuts &c are brought up the coast in small vessels.  Whalers sometimes put in here for stores - and ships bound up to the Mexican or Oregon coast - are sometimes consigned to the respective consuls resident here.  This is the amount of Panama trade.\nTwo Pasadoes or prisons - contain each a number of convicts. The soldiers are the jailers.  The employment of the prisoners is braiding straw - and from their dismal rooms - they assail the visitor with hands outstreched for rials - crying - \"me mucho pauvre!\" They are also employed in repairing the streets - when they are chained together.  With buckets made of hides - they bring up sand from the beach.  Trudging slowly along in the hot sun - or working with the utmost leisure - they are an improvement on the general torpid movements of the inhabitants.  The soldiers their keepers look lazier and more weary then the convicts.  The Pasades of Panama serve for a section of the surrounding country.\nThe Barracks and Soldiers - Military Equipments and Discipline are in as drearyed condition as the Town itself.  The Garrison consist of about 20 men.  A belt cartridge box - flint lock musket a hanger - and blue cap with red striped - constitutes the Soldiers equipment.  These men often paraded through the streets - preceeded by fife and drum - now to head a religious procession - or now to squell a disturbance.  Their quarters did not appear very comfortable to me.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":93104,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/93104","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/9798492b7b9f2a80070d236b9c310ce7.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/9798492b7b9f2a80070d236b9c310ce7.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/9798492b7b9f2a80070d236b9c310ce7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9798492b7b9f2a80070d236b9c310ce7.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-10T22:44:14+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:51:32+00:00","filename":"9798492b7b9f2a80070d236b9c310ce7.jpg","authentication":"eff15be0842eaf94a7c63b0df39b6d10","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3139_00047_o2.jpg","size":891856,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1843,"resolution_y":2219,"compression_ratio":0.072692707736038}},"item":{"id":1206,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1206","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"38\nto inspire veneration by their lofty ceilings - and roomy interior - their decorated altars and teriselled images - they now scarce shelter the worshipper from the rain of heaven - while the dust and decay of years - beglooms the whole.  Here Papacy grown old and rusty - worshipes at altars whose fires are quenched.\nThe inhabitants of Panama are of all colors.  Under the old regime they were of all castes - but the republic makes all alike now.  The families of the Castalian blood are very few.  These few are proud - thought poor - dress finely - and pass the time as agreeably as possible.  The gentlemen have a billiard and reading room - the ladies spend their leisure in giving and receiving visits.  Some of the ladies are beauties - and as a general thing both the males and females possess some claims to good personal appearance.  The ladies seldom wear bonnets in the streets.  Considerable jealousy prevails among these old families.\nTheir houses are well furnished - tables - chairs and sofas - and several lamps in glass globes suspended from the ceiling adorn their apartments.  But an American cannot but feel how poor - meagre and poverty stricken their houses appear - besills their personal attire and pride.  They are jealous of their old Castilian tongue.  They hold to it as the rock which saves their sinking caste.  The next class in the olive complexion which is now become the distinctive characteristic of the South American.  These are the principal shop keepers of the city.  They are a contented race - of pleasant dispositions - hospitable mind and strongly attached to their Panama.  The blacks who were once the slaves are the poorest and most degraded class.  They are also the most numerous.  They live almost anywhere - and labor for almost anything.  The men are principally carriers.  The women - washerwomen.  The Indian of the Isthmus is about lost in the commingling of races.  The blacks are not very virtuous - indeed I could hardly discover any family ties among them.  The negro woman does not claim any father for her children - but she will boast with pride if she has a white child.\nThe only amusement I discovered in the place - was a Spanish Circus.  Here nightly a drum and fife played before the house and two soldiers guarded the door.

A strong wall faces the hill side through channels in which the water drops into the jars of the water carriers.  This water as it issues from the hill is very pure and cool.  The jars holding 5 or 6 gallons - is carried into the city and distributed on mens shoulders - or by mules two being strapped on each side.  Such was the crowd of Americans in the city - that these springs could not supply the demand - and water was obtained from the clear running creek that crosses the Cnices Road about a mile and a half - beyond the Gate.  The price of a jar of water was one vial - or mexican shilling.  In the rainy season - many of the houses are provided with open cisterns in the courts which catches the runnings of the roof.\nCharcoal and wood is brought in chiefly by the bringies from Toboga.  They land upon the beach and retail their cargo.  Now and then a mule is seen however passing through the streets ladened with sticks.\nGaming is a favorite passion of the South Americans.  They play with an earnestness relish and zeal which quite distances the cooler gamesters of colder climates.  Panama was full of these games of hazard - during my stay.  Nightly and daily too - the Morte - the Phaso - the Roulette Table - crowded by the Spanish and American votaries of this vice - were rattling with changing coin.\nThe Currency of the country - which bears the seal of the New Gunadian Republic is miserably coined.

The Gold - I saw but little among the people - is doubloon - eight pence - and Quarter Piece - Sixteen dollars - Eight dollars - Four dollars.

Almost every house shows merchandize for sale.  Most of the shops are petty things - being mere places for sale of liquors - and fruits.  Wines and most of their liquors are brought up from Callao - where they have been imported from France.  The people drink unversally - but they do not get inibriated.  The usual salutation is accompained - if circumstances favor with an invitation to take wine.  Spirits are retailed in a small wine glass - which the purchaser turns down his throat at a mouthful.  I have wondered sometimes if their throats nass not lined with sheet iron.  Their stocks of groceries are limited - rice - cocoa - coffee molasses - sugar and beans being the staples.\nOne street is devoted mostly to dry goods - handware - crockery &c.  These stores make quite a respectable show - an apothecary shop or two look quite business like.  Most of these goods come from Jamaica.  Prices are high.  There is a very pleasant drink made of pine apples called Chuchee - which is much used.

This was settled finally by taking the task in routine by two's term of service three days.  The general plan followed by the emigrants who did not camp without the city was to hire rooms - buy food and cook for themselves.  Those who prefered stopping at the hotels could be boarded for $2.0 per diem.  Our company the BCEC - hired very pleasant rooms on the corner of the Cull de San Antonio and the Calle de San Miguel.  We ascended an easy flight of stone stairs - from the landing of which we entered our rooms.  The first ones our luggage and dining room - this opened into a room devoted our Director and his family - and into the general lodging room of the company.  The front room opened to the balcony - a pleasant place for evening sociability.  Below we had access to the court - in yard - in which our culinary work was performed.  I cannot refer these apartments but with a feeling of pleasure - for though their actual looked anything but promising - yet there was a beautiful in their actual - evident to a contented spirit - brought out by pleasant associations connected therewith.  They never seemed gloomy or ugly to me.

Indeed I hardly suffered at all from the heat of the climate.\nSenor Lopez was our landlord - a young Spanish gentleman - with whom and his cousin Senor Sosa - I shortly became acquainted.  The rental of our rooms was 20 rials per day.  The passing of the United States dime - for a rial - made this coin in good demand among the Americans.\nShortly after our arrival a party was formed to go out on the hills and fetch in fuel.  They accomplished their purpose - returning with the faggots on their backs - but one of the men loitered behind.  Nothing was thought about it - dinner was eaten the afternoon passed - evening came and Huskins had not been seen.

This republic in conjunction with Venezuela and Equador once formed the confederation of Columbia.  In 1838 they dissolved connection - divided the public debt and have since continued to administer their own affairs.  The vice royalty of New Granada was instituted in 1517.  The accession of Joseph Bonaparte to the throne of Spain - gave the first impulse to the colonies - to throw off the Spanish yoke - which they did generally - proclaiming themselves republics in 1819.  The congress of New Grenada meet at Santa Fe de Bogota.  They appoint Governors - Alcaldie to the various provinces and towns withing their jurisdiction.  Panama as a province has its governor as a city -its alcaldi.  The soldiers form the police.  During the quiet disposition of its inhabitants - criminal actions are few - so that the cases which come before the alcalde are mostly civil cases.  It is difficult to carry through a case - justice here as in our own courts - moving with tardy steps.\nSchools in the city are rare.  I saw but one having a female teacher.  The urchins were small - but surely how stranger were all studying Spanish.  The children of the old families are of such as desire and can afford it are sent away to Cherra or Santa Fe.\nThere is one newspaper in the city - a weekly.  Really except as a medium of political informaiton - I could not think Panama would afford matter to support a print.  I went into the office - the type stands were tenentless - the press was a monument of inglorious inservitude.  The editor in his disolate sunctum - was the only remaining spirit of the place.  I could not remark how different this scene from that of our newspaper offices at home - and how sure a sign this - of the difference between benumbed Panama and our own happy America.  The printing office is a good index of a people.  It is the barometer of business - energy and activity.\nThe domestic habits of the people are such as naturally result - from living under a burning sun and doing but little business.

Stillness growing I heard the shells - a small pile of which were deposited in the corner near Tinkers head scratching along the floor - and anticipated soon another disturbance.  Again Tinker found he had a bedfellow - and the shell was launched at random across the room - accompanied with an imathema on the conchological fever.  Next Stone felt something gently crawling over him and another shell came sailing through the air.  Jests - and jokes - began to circulate about the crabs - their interests - their migrating propensities - their partiality for the annoyed corner - until for repose sake - the shells were removed outside to the balcony.  The the crabs were left to tempt their fate if so disposed by crawling over the edge.\nTaking the fish out of the shells one day - after being boiled - a native boy came into the yard - and commenced eating them with great gusto.

Just as we were issuing from the gate - we met some of our companions returning with the cause of our disquiet.  They had found him trudging homewards sick and weak as he was - under a log - which afterwards formed a respectable load for two of us.  Poor distressed soul - one stick more had laid heavy on his disposition for saving.  Quite absorbed in his prudent calculations - he was quite surprised at our disturbance on his account.\nI could not help laughing at the retort made by quite a pretty female - upon L W Haskins - not a youth of very talking exterior.  Passing he cried out in a very amatory tone - \"bonita Senorita\". (beautiful Senorita) - Bonita Senorita she repeated in supercillious mockery - bonita Senorita - viejo Americano (ugly American). The Native girls I have no doubt were very much bored - by the Americans - and their smattering Spanish.  Certainly their lavish gallantries - were enough to disgust any well disposed Panamanian maiden.\nThe reefs and beached afford great scope to the Cinchologist - abounding as they do with a great variety of marine shells.  Dr Newcomb and myself were not long in determining upon bringing away the spoils which were so temptingly offered.  Armed therefore for such predatory movements - we made frequent excursions - upon the reefs.  With hammer and haversack and umbrellas - day after day we wandered over them - turning over the stones picking in the crevices - and wading on the flats.  Each excursion bringing some new shell to light - kept my ardor bright - and urged me to still greater industry.  One day I struggled through the mud seeking   .  Another waded in the pools and gushered with exultation numerous varieties of beautiful Coral.

One day I stumbled on some gigantic conches - which I bore to the house in triumph.  We found many among the rocks bearing as company in our employment.  The finding of the shells pleased me well - but ah! the boiling - the cleaning and preparing - it were enough to dissuade a very enthusiast.

O how wild - how fanciful - how pleasing!\nBathing was a favorite amusement with us.  The warm climate invited to the refreshing water - and the playful waves promised sport.  Every day saw the Americans - thronging the beach and swimming in the agitated sea.  The Panamanians do not affect the sea water but they relish bathing in fresh water.  One moonlight night I met a party of girls - returning with gay spirits - from a bathing excursion to the stream without the city.  Panama water over the head - from a cakebush bowl - is a favorite plan.\nLoitering on the beach.  I saw some natives landing jackapis from a bringie.  They had been brought up from Peru.  The animals were boosted overboard and when utterly incorrigable hoisted out by a girth passing under their bellies.  As of already sated with the sea by their voyage - and disinclined to take a cruise in their own accounts without chart or compass - they were very loth to be put over the side so conceroinoniously.  Some steered will to land - being caught and mounted by a nation wading out for that pupose but several with snerting and brayings - put out gallenetly to sea - to the great disconifiture of the boats - which presently gave chase.  But at that they all got safe to land.  They were bought by the contractor that brought us over - at $115.00 each.\nOur Director essayed once - to go out with a friend in one of these clumey bringies to see a small schooner for which they were negotiating.  The wind - the waves and the tide - obstructed the voyage.  They were driven upon a point of the reefs - to the endangering of their lives - and after some two hours hard labor were glad to regain the beach.\nIt was Passion Week when we arrived in Panama.  The Church enabled by the money and liberality of the Americans - was doing what their poverty have forbidden for many previous years - celebrating according to Catholic customs - the events of this Holy Week.  One grand procession had occurred before our arrival.  On Friday Evening - at the Cathedral - took place the Entombing of the Saviour.  Going there we found - one of the recesses - filled by a pymmidal frame work - gaudily adorned - with images - pictures - flowers - ribbons &c and the whole brilliantly illumined with wax candles - inclosed in - plain and ornamental ground - oblong glass shades - and other candles hung and otherwise disposed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":93112,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/93112","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b43549b3962e81c34b840dd1d6278da0.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b43549b3962e81c34b840dd1d6278da0.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b43549b3962e81c34b840dd1d6278da0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b43549b3962e81c34b840dd1d6278da0.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-10T22:44:21+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:51:32+00:00","filename":"b43549b3962e81c34b840dd1d6278da0.jpg","authentication":"abc1ed1d350849c28a322acf3d8fc7f4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3139_00051_o2.jpg","size":914510,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1843,"resolution_y":2222,"compression_ratio":0.074438534466577}},"item":{"id":1206,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1206","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"46\nthe influx of more waves - not to be disregarded.  Careless naturalists we found our retreat intercepted by the sea.  Quite a body of water lay before us - uncertain of its depth - we paused to meditate our escape.  But to remain where we was - was death - the advancing tide was behind us - and such sullen wave as it swept through the crevices and over the rocks - warned up of approaching fate.\nTerrence could not swim - but to look for help from the shore - was vain - our rocky heights would be submerged - long before we could be reached - could we even gain notice from thence.  Our only resource then was the water - and into it we went.  It surely could not be overhead - the tide cannot have risen so much - so we floundered forward over fragments of rock - now rising on a stone - and now sinking deep again in some hole or hollow of the reef.  We forded the pass - and safe on the other side - pursued our way to the shore with dripping garments - thankful in having discovered our situation so opportunely.\nThe tides at Panama - are quite interesting to observe - the distance [?] and overflowed is great - and the current of the flun and reflun is strong.  When the water begins to cover the reefs - the rollers commence.  The quiet sea beyond seems hardly ruffled - but you see a gentle swell coming - it no sooner touches the reefs - en it mass piles up - and curling with foaming top - it tumbles - and roars along - till it breaks - in a milky line upon the beach.  There the flow and ebb of the waves - are from twenty to thirty feet.  It was amusing to watch boats landing.  The wave brings them in beautiful - in an instant they are left atilt on the sands - in another if the boatmen have not been spry - comes another wave - and knocks the boat - like a sledge hammer - disturbing the equilibrium of all aboard.\nA man came to land one day in a canoe - his manner indicated - \"I am to old for these waves.\"  He touched the beach - and instantly was left dry - but he standing up with paddle in hand - wished to alter the position of his boat.  The man came - and as if insulted - more fierce than before.  It struck - and quick as lightning - the man was tumbled over and submerged and canoe and all - thrown far up on the sands.\nI could have sat for hours and watched those waves as they broke upon the sounding shore.

The first sight that met my eyes on going out on the balcony - after I arose - was Judas strung up by the neck - and attached to a rope stretched across the street.  There he hung - the traitor the object of the excration and curses of every good Catholic on this morning.  Many families have their own puppet Judas whom they dispatch simarily in a private way.  In the evening the Judas which hung in the street - having been fired - exploded in a series of fieworks - and when he fell - the burning fragments were hurled about by the boys.\nWent to the Cathedral on Easter morning.  The priests were there in full force - in their robes and caps - and cannonical garments.  The place was well attended by the people.  Extra service was performed.  I did not understand the matter.  There was readings by the priest - responses from the people - chantings from the choir - chantings from the priests - and a great number of petty ceremonies.\nI often wandered into the churches - which were generally open.  Some service or other was continually in progression.  The priests - perform church ceremonies as a matter of business.  The daily mass - or prayers and ceremonies set apart to observed days - are performed by the priests without any reference to the people.  If they have auditors well - if not no matter - the bare walls turn hearers - and the ritual is satisfied.  Some one has told me the Spaniards - upon unlimited confidence in the three professions - and do not trouble themselves about the result - they pay the physician for taking care of their body's - the lawyers for taking care of their property - and the priests for the care of their souls.  It is no concern of theirs to look after that which the belongs to another to watch.\nI looked about among the churches if perchance I might discover among their pictures some of merit - but of the few I found - all were mean - dirty and neglected.  The ornaments of the churches - are of the cheapest material - tinsel and gilt.

I could not help wondering at the the scene.  That shrine so bright with light - and between me and it - that crowd of prayers - kneeling and sitting on the dirty and cold pavement - while the confused noise of mumbled prayers filled my ears.  The most of the devotees were the common people - who looked about and prayed at the same time - but now and then came in a cluster of finely draped Se\u00f1ioras and Se\u00f1oritas - and spreading down their tasteful mats - would close their black eyes - and move their pretty lips - in devotion.\nSaturday evening was devoted to a grand procession.  Several large altars composed of similar things - as the one we had seen the proceeding evening - which had engaged many men in preparing - were deposited in the church from whence the march was to commence.  Having been provided with candles - we repaired to the church.  All was bustle and preparation I gazed with wonder at the huge altars - can it be possible they purpose to carry these altars through the rough and uneven streets?  At length the lighting of the altars commenced - they looked splendid.  Sixty men lifted the largest and moved forward - the procession was formed - each person bearing a lighted candle.  No garment of a light color was allowed to be worn.  The Tomb of the Savior moved first - preceeded by priests - and the authorities of the city.  A damask canopy - borne by several gentlemen - followed a string of the citizens.  Another altar - with an image of the Savior - filled its place in the procession - and lastly - the altar with the Virgin upon it - followed by the women.\nWe moved to the music of fiddles - flutes & alternating with chantings by an old negro and answered by the priests.  I was much disposed to enjoy the scene.  The song of the old negro - with its nasal twang - and its peculiar twist - turn and shake - amused me greratly.  But the procession moved so slow - and the men bearing the altars had to rest so often - that the matter became quite tedious.  I thought we had overshot the mark in volunteering to walk in the procession.  It was not till near twelve o'clock that we got the altars safely back to the churches - and were dismissed.  Early the next morning Easter Sunday - the Tomb was brought out on the Plaza.  It was the Resurection.

I did not hear much music in Panama.  There was a bad of young men - who with violins flutes so gave concerts week nights - or played Sunday in the Church Service.  They were quite good performers.  A native man sat on our balcony one evening and sang for us several airs.  The Spanish words and music are singularly sweet.  The liquid sounds of their language adapt it well for songs.

We often stoped to while away an hour with them - to drink checher - or listen to their singing.  The women are very averse to singing in the day time - it is only in the evenings they will assume their guitars - and songs.  They very quietly remark night is the only time proper to music.  The songs of the family were low and plaintive - when all joined in as they frequently did - they made music which charmed me.\nMost of the women as well as men practice smoking.  It is as much a custom as eating.  The women delight greatly in inhaling the tobacco - by placing the lighted ends of their sigars - within their mouths.  It was singular to me how they could talk - their sigars being thus reversed without burning themselves.

At the base we found several houses - with gardens land out around them.  I noticed pine apples growing - the papaya or Bread Fruit Tree - and some flowers.  Owing to the want of rain - vegetation looked poorly.  We were fortunate in striking the Isthmus in the dry season - though the heat was great - we were not annoyed by rain in travelling.  We wound up the hill by a tortuous and winding path - as we neared the summit - several turkey buzzards sailed lazily about us - and finally lit upon some tree tops in a ravine below our feet.

Much water has fallen during the night and day.  Business for the morning - making peach pies - and Gingerbread.  I have become quite an adept in cooking.  Several have called on me for lessons.  An offer of $300 per month was offered me to act in this department over at the Eating house.  Quite a new profession this would be for me.  This afternoon we rocked out $3.00 - amid the pauses of the rain.  Some miners who started yesterday morning to go up to the mills - had only advanced 2 miles with their teams - by this day noon.  They walked back and dined here.  Another party who bought a team - and started for Amado Creik - spent a week on the road - advanced 4 miles and gave up in despair.\nWent up to Munins Store Tent.  He is a speciman of a man.  Full of bombust - and show.  We visited him for amusement.  Among other conveniences we miners enjoy is that of getting our letters.  Warren offers to get them from the office at San Francisco - at $1.00 per letter beside the postage.  Should it chance to be double $2.00 beside the postage 80 cts.  This he calls justice - we joined issue on the point - but he has the advantage.  He has business down to the seaport - we none.\nOur first introduction to Warren was laugahable.  We were taking our dinner - seated on the ground.  When he came into the place.  Riding at the head of his company - who were trudging along with their teams - he came up the hill - stately and with looks of self - complacency - which spoke his inward self-satisfaction.  \"Jackson\" cried he - \"you go on and search out some tent stakes - that no time he lost.  Here Bernar - be ready to help when the teams ascend the hill\".  All his orders - were stentorian as a colonel to his regiment - and accompanied with a majestic wave of the hand.  Passing him - we bowed which he returned with much motion.  \"From whence do you come\"?  From Boston - just arrived in the ship Sweden?  This speech was accompanied with a profound gesture - a graceful bow - and a smile of superlative complacency.  We instantly dubbed him Napolean.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":93122,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/93122","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7908d981544896e246608b4640345140.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7908d981544896e246608b4640345140.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7908d981544896e246608b4640345140.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7908d981544896e246608b4640345140.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-10T22:44:30+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:51:32+00:00","filename":"7908d981544896e246608b4640345140.jpg","authentication":"6fdadfb2bf4d401eb4a8ac7cb36d8912","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3139_00056_o2.jpg","size":964395,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1875,"resolution_y":2217,"compression_ratio":0.077333333333333}},"item":{"id":1206,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1206","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"56\nTeusday November 20th\nTo day has been a beautiful a sunny day as heart could desire.

We were only charged 50 cts each for fimage - the passage across occupy is one minute.  We rose the steep hill and went to a ravine about a mile distant.

Prospecting is the miners evil genius.  He hates it - he is driven to it only through the most absolute necessity.  It consists in clambering over rocks - diving into the difiles - up again upon the high hills - following the water courses - and whenever the make of the ground looks favourable - digging down to the grimite and washing the dirt.  Amid hope and expectation - judging and digging - appearance of success - or empty discouragement - both mind and boy get seriously wearied in prospecting.\nYesterday we in the pauses of the rain - which one spell turned into hail - were prospecting on a big hill which formed the head of a ravine.  We theorized and dug but to no purpose.  The gold would not abide our decision.  We thought as the ravine - was only the wash of the hill - surely on the level top - we ought to find that which the slpe could not wash off.  We found some particles - perhaps our search might have been rewarded under more favourable circumstances - as it was the rise of water into the holes prevented our getting down to the original rock.\nA miner visiting us to night tells large stories of ravines about 4 miles below us.  To morrow I shall Prospect them.  I hope - fortune will not alter the good wind which blows this evening - promissing success.  We saw many miners to day out with their shovels and pans.  A sure sign the digging are getting scarce.  Two met us packing their provision from the store.  They were groaning and sweating under about 150 pounds each.

Simon reached forth a helping hand and drew him out.  For my life I could not help laughing at the scene.  We reached a favorable gulch soon and panned out some of its dirt.  It yielded us about one shilling - to a panfull.  Torrence who had stopped to wring out his clothes - now joined us and we went to the hill top - to eat our meal.

It is a pennisular rather than an island and has been formed by a curve in the headlands causing the deposits of the stream to accumulate until the water has been entirely turned from its original channel.  The soil is composed principally of sand and various sized stones - through which the gold is unequally distributed.  The chief deposit lies next the granite - partly because I suppose - it would catch by its irrigularities the floating particles of metal and partly - because it receives all the siftings of the upper soil.  It lies beneath the surface some 6 or 10 feet.  This fact - explains the reason why the miners labour so earnestly to reach the solid rock - for often the stratum of soil lying next it - pays well when the surface soil is hardly worth unshing.  Like the diamond mines of Sincura - there is a strtum of soil richer than the rest - and this stratum can only be found by digging down to the granite rock.  I suppose there are about 50 persons now mining on the island - and with all kinds of success.  Some making over an ounce $16.00 per day and some not $4.00.  We cannot tell where to dig - for the gold is unequally distributed and gives no indication of its location.  If there be any virtue in witch hazel - this is the Country for it.\nOur success to day.  Senor and myself was $14.00.  I do not expect to do over that sum while we mine on the island.  Never was there a spot of ground so thoroughly as has been this Mormon Bar.  Its stones and rubble have been turned again and again - its soil thrown hither and thither.  The first miners were content only with 2 or 4 oz per day - and so threw away the loose soil - the next get - content with one oz washed the ground which had been overlooked before.

One of the miners - Charles Boardman of New Bedford was busy digging - into the high bank where so much success has been had - when the ground caved burying him in - and crushing him horribly.  Poor young man! in the midst of his gold dreaming death has overtaken him - and called him away to that land where gold is dross - and the gems of earth - of no value.  How sudden - how vast the change!  How different the ideas - the objects presented to the [?soil?].  Now occupied with employments - and wishes of so earthy and so completely sordid nature - and now - as in the twinkling of an eye - gazing on the realities of eternity and absorbed in contemplating its position in that unchangeable state.  At once cut off and the souls destiny fixed.  But a moment ago - and he might have become a child of God - life and death were in his choice - he had a chance of Heaven - now lies he without choice - without remedy.  And if unholy - unholy forever - if holy - then holy and justified through all eternity.  I went down to see him.  His partners had dug him out - and laid him on the sand.  His hands yet bore the marks of the soil - his cap served for a pillow - his clothing had been loosed - but there was the paleness of Death on his brow.  O! how thrilling - [?owing?] thus Death in the midst of life.  It was not Death - in the chamber - with solemn faces and weeping friends around sad accompaniments - softening the presence of Man's last foe - but Death - in the very scenes of the living the implements lying near - and our struck miners - gazing reverently on the face of the dead.\nA blow had been given - a monition which all heard - one thought and another thought in the awe of their hearts - could it not as easily have been me?

Deceased had a wife and eleven children in Missouri - owned a farm and store was doing well but must come to California - to improve even upon well.  He came and has lost his life - O gold too dearly bought!  gold too costly!  Here dies a victim lingering out his last agonies - devoid of almost every comfort - which wife and children - so carefully use to smooth the dying bed.  A life shortned - by too eager pursuit of treasure.  This poor man has lingered several days in great pain - alternately praying God to have mercy upon his unsaved soul - and to let him die at once and thus drop his heavy load of bodily misery.\nI was over there two days ago.  I saw a California scene.  This dying - distressed man lay - on his cot - in another part of the room.  Col Ramons drunk - and full of laugh and drunken good nature - talked to me - while several men stood about - cooking at the fire place as coming in or out the door.  The dying was here but the living took no herd of it - they laughed and chatted on turning their backs on deaths unwelcome face.  How then death lost his turns? is he no longer dreaded.  So it would seem.  In this land - men only shrug their shoulders turn, away and exclaim \"I am glad it is not me.\nTo day then was still another stronger scene.  When the people were nearly all seated - in walks - the drunken lunatic Mose - and pace before the coffin - smoking a sigar - and bearing in his left hand a huge horse pistol.  Perhaps he thought himself a military patrol - standing guard over the dead.  He stops show signs of grief - and resumes his melencholy march.\nReturning from the grave we stopped at the waggon to see the hunatic Bvewirth.  Sad spectacle of humanity!  Some one shot him in his ankle for a midnight depredation.

With his knife he took out at once $400 - he went again with his companions and they got some $3000 - before the mine failed.  So falls the luck - here - there - anywhere but in our bowl.

The rise has been about twenty feet.  The rapidity of the current is surprising.  It flies like an arrow - it boils and foams among the rocks broken in an hundred eddies - trees once high on the bank - and bushes with dripping foilage - sway and tremble in the rushing stream - logs and drift stuff plunge heading [down].

The Kansas letters are all very acceptable, you may be sure. I am very sorry Mate is P.S. No. 2 - Am glad Carroll has a good chance for school this fall - does Charlie go to Mr. Howell? Is Mr. H. Walsh? Eddie looked quite sorry when he read Jennie's letter, telling how glad you were to see his writing on the outside of my letter - He said \"I must write to them.\" - I guess he will.

dear brothers and sisters. Do you remember that when the prophets of Baal were verily calling upon him to honor their sacrafice Elija? told them to cry aloud, for he was either deaf or he was asleep or on a journey. Now he did this to mock them for you know that Baal was no God, if he had been a God, he would have heard the faintest whisper. No where in the scripture do we see it hinted that the great and living God can hear a loud cry any plainer than the gentlest sigh. Perhaps some of us may have thought that shouting and screaming was more acceptable to God than the low earnest prayer. Well, let us look at that. Who is our spotless example, whom we should always strive to follow. what was his habit. what are his commands?

It was read and reread until I fairly cried for joy.  It brought to mind those few but happy hours we spent together, the remembrance of which ever causes an indescribable pleasure. But, those bygone days are past forever. We would be parted! Oh! when to meet again! I can but hope that we shall be permitted to see each others faces again, and have a regular oldfashioned chat. Shall we not? I look forward to such a season with great anticipation.  \u2014\u2014\u2014 You delayed writing so long that I feared you was worse, and not able to write, and had about concluded to write again; but I am glad to find that my fears wer unfounded Yes!

I got a letter from him, a few days ago, saying he had not quite finished his arrangements at home, so he could leave yet. \u2013 but hoped to in a few days. So we do not know yet how soon he will start. I have been getting some of the Bills filled out \u2013 have got all those of this State and some other done. I do not think it would be best to try to get \n\nin margins:\nwill do with it but Wm. is able to go to R. tomorrow he will take it and try to do the best he can \u2013 either send or sell. It will not do to keep it as he may not be able to go down for some time. A little then might shut us up. We hope to finish Mothers tub this month. Do you think butter wold sell better if it was colored? That opinion seems to be gaining ground here. We have not tried it yet. I do not cough nearly as much as I did especially nights I feel stronger and have more heart to make plans for next summer.

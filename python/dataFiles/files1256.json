I had just received, as I have always thought, my first pair of trousers. I was walking from the house down the narrow walk toward the barn and as I passed Charlie who was working in the woodshed he said \"Don't wet them.\"\nI remember very plainly the day the family picture was taken. This was sometime before 1889 probably around 1887. Someone, it seems to me it was Harl had to go to the mill to get Charlie to come to the photograph gallery. I also remember several times in the north bed room of the old house, sleeping with Charlie and feeling he was crowding me off the bed.\nWhen I went to Lawrence I roomed the first year with him at Wilder's and I boarded with Wilder. I mowed the lawn and did a few odd jobs and thought I was earning my board but found Marian sent Wilder $2,50 a week for my board. Charlie always left the house very early in the morning and came in fairly late at night so I didn't really get acquainted with him until the next year when we moved to Mrs Eldridge's house about a block away still on Rhode Island Street. Charlie paid the room rent but really wasn't in the room over 7 or 8 hours a day staying in the office nights. I studied in the office frequently and when I suggested we go home, Charlie would say \"go home when you can't go somewhere else\" and before going home he asked me to go out and walk with him. During those long walks we surely covered the town but there was very little said. That year I don't remember what breakfast, if any, either of us ate but we did get one big meal a day at Epp's restaurant costing by means of a $3.00 meal ticket just 16 2\/3 cents a meal. If there was any bread left on the plate Charlie put it in his pocket and for supper we ate it with peanuts, apples and blackened bananas in the office. During the evening very frequently some hard up looking man would come in for a loan. After thoroughly questioning him he usually went away jingling","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101213,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101213","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/8345695c708c08ce7213fce862f2447e.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/8345695c708c08ce7213fce862f2447e.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/8345695c708c08ce7213fce862f2447e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8345695c708c08ce7213fce862f2447e.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-20T19:21:51+00:00","modified":"2020-06-03T20:27:35+00:00","filename":"8345695c708c08ce7213fce862f2447e.jpg","authentication":"58e1302451f3f4f092d34687b657e85e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_134_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1197866,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2367,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046858267223709},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180723"],"TimeCreated":["050647"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180723"],"TimeCreated":["050647"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180723"],"TimeCreated":["050647"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8345695c708c08ce7213fce862f2447e.jpg","FileDateTime":1587410508,"FileSize":1197866,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2367\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2367,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:24 13:51:05","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:23 05:06:47","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:23 05:06:47","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3025,"ExifImageLength":4599,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1256,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1256","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"a little money in his pocket. It wasn't always for money loan he they came in. I have seen several come in to hand Charlie a payment either in full or partial, probably principally to keep his audit good. I would make a guess, tho, that most of the pages in his account book showed the money going out much more often and larger than the money coming in. I often have wished that his account book had been saved. It would be very interesting. There were several pages of investments in oil stock which seldom had given a return. He told me of several which he still thought would amount to something. That was a time when Eastern Kansas was booming with gas and oil discoveries and such towns as Iola were bringing in smelters and other factories which came to enjoy cheap gas fuel. The prospects for gas and oil even went out into Western Kansas where Charlie was part owner of quite a little acreage only to be lost when hard times came.\nI am afraid Charlie always had a feeling he had worked a lot without being recompensed properly like his many years in the flour mill, and I know he felt during many of his last years at Lawrence that he was taken advantage of. I don't know for sure, but I think there were many months when the business didn't leave enough for his small salary and he went without even tho Wilder had enough to support his riding horse and a good living. Sometimes, but not often, I heard him speak quite bitterly.'\nI think maybe the family owed him more than most of us know and I suppose probably I owed him more than the others as I lived in his room for 4 years and some of the time he paid for many of my meals.\nWhen I came home one night, Sept. 14, 1903 and told him I had just \"popped the question to Clara\" the only remark I got from him was \"Has she got good teeth?\" She did have and still has, which is more than I can say about her husband. I think Charlie got to like Clara very much as when we lived in Topeka some 6 months, he very frequently came up for Sunday to see us.\nDuring my last year at KU, I boarded at what was called The Que Vera Club and my savings from the summer's work","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101214,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101214","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c0da4306519b0e62ffdad1b674d9657a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/c0da4306519b0e62ffdad1b674d9657a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/c0da4306519b0e62ffdad1b674d9657a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c0da4306519b0e62ffdad1b674d9657a.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-20T19:21:52+00:00","modified":"2020-06-03T20:35:17+00:00","filename":"c0da4306519b0e62ffdad1b674d9657a.jpg","authentication":"63df296cf122c16d11900e939713b18b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_134_002_003_o2.jpg","size":1166285,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2369,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04558436127136},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180723"],"TimeCreated":["050652"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180723"],"TimeCreated":["050652"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180723"],"TimeCreated":["050652"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c0da4306519b0e62ffdad1b674d9657a.jpg","FileDateTime":1587410508,"FileSize":1166285,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2369\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2369,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:24 13:51:06","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:23 05:06:52","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:23 05:06:52","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":47,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3041,"ExifImageLength":4621,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1256,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1256","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Sheet 2\nwere insufficient to pay my expenses. I borrowed in all about $350 from Charlie secured by my first $1000 insurance policy, an endorsement policy with Northwestern Mutual.\nOn graduation I went to work as a draftsman for the Illinois Steel Co. in Chicago. I continued to live on one meal a day with a glass of milk and breakfast food for breakfast and a couple of sweet rolls for supper, eating a hearty dinner at a laborer's boarding house near the steel plant at 35 cents a meal. My main idea in life was to pay back Charlie that $350 and then save a little to get married onl. I found an old account book of mine recently that showed my regular payments to him. It took a little over three months at $50 a month but not many more months at $75 and travelling expenses when I went to Beaumont Texas in September.\nI heard from Charlie regularly probably every week while I was in Texas and often I went to Montana. He never wrote much but always sent many clippings from the Lawrence paper.\nCharlie, as we all know, never went to College. I never knew why not, but I'm ready to bet he know more of worth while knowledge than most of his brothers and sisters who had the advantage of a college education. He was very well read and kept thoroughly abreast of the times.\nI don't believe he ever joined a church but he was a regular attendant at the Congregational Church in Lawrence and while I was there, at least, attended old Cap't Haskell's Men's Sunday School class every Sunday even during the year I was persuaded to teach a class of 11 or 12 year old girls.

The sad operation is all over & Mr. Rider is nicely comfortable. Feels better than either time before. Sam'l and Eliab both went to the Dr.'s with him. Eliab saw the whole operation, so did James - Sam'l went into another room - he is easily overcome at such a time. The doctor was two minutes with his knives , & ten before it was all done up. Gertie seems - well, & was going to say a little better, but can only say she is certainly no worse, and the Dr. says that is enough to encourage us a good deal she was so very low yesterday. He is giving cod liver oil -the only thing he knew of that could help her, as she is so low he does not give her any active medicine. They rub her also in  the oil, as he says she may be much strengthened in that way. We just about gave her up yesterday. I never saw so pitiful looking a child.

[in pencil] We have got two pretty beatiflies of Libby's, as ever you saw in your life. We had but had one of them killed. Sister Lute.\nDear Isaac Brother\n\n              I can't fix one of Joe's steel pens on. So a wrong stick, and he is using the right one, so I have to hold the pen right in my fingers, but I guess I won't any longer. So now I'll begin with the tother one. Isaac, I can tell you something that is very good news to me. I don't know as you will care about it either way.\n              The \"folkses\" have sent for me to go to Boston to help Almeida do her work, Although I expect I shall see you 'face to face' & tell you about it before you will read this ere epistle. So no more of that now.\n             \"Brother Joe\" has wrote or written so much to you that I suppose he has told you all the news. But I believe he has not told you about the \"new neighbors.\" There is Austin & Mellen Rye & Barnard, Warren, Enoch, Augustus and Edward Ellis. They are trying to learn to navigate I guess, for they are down in the brook, paddling about on a raft that they made, every rainy day and half the time beside, most.\n             Dolly has fatted up at a great rate; Mr. Shaw has offered Charles 20 dollars for her, but he asks 25. By the time he wants her again he will ask 30, I suppose. There has been a tall freshet here. The water did not quite cover our Intervale, but did Mr. Ellis's. Mother wrote to James and \"amongst um\" to let little Lucy come here with Martha when she comes back. but they said No. We did not expect they would let her come however. I don't know as Marm told you that Martha Lee and Moses G. are going or rather have gone with Naomi to Charleston Hospital. Is'nt it a pity I could'nt have known they wanted me there this Summer, soon enough to have gone with Martha? What beautiful showers we had the 2ed of June, didn't we? only the ground was so full of Water, that it did not seem to do much good.\n             'Ieus' why don't you buy ruled paper? it is so much better to write on, and does not cost but a little more than the other.

The lines were few and far between I thought. It did not look as brother Isaac's letters to home generally do, it seems to me. We will receive it, however on the supposition that you were so sleepy that you had but a few thoughts, as I doubt not you are a great part of the time nowadays, notwithstanding some of your boasting speeches in time past, with regard to your triumphs over Morphus.

A shower came up just as we had finished our report and I was obliged to flee to the house, so I did not hear the toasts, which I suppose were the best part of the whole.

So they talked and talked (as you know how) a long time, then went down to the mill, examined the machinery etc, etc, Yesterday he came again, talked all the afternoon, and staid all night. This morning they wrote an agreement, each took a copy, and he went off. Charles has let him the mill for one year, and I believe partly agreed to for 5 years, though it is not concluded, and will not be until they see how matters will turn out a little. Charles is to furnish materials, for repairing the mill, and Mr. Heald is to do the work, and pay 50.00 a year in money for the rent. Mr. H. appears to be a very clever, good sort of a man, a kind of Thomsonian doctor, for his own family; I don't know how much farther his practice extend. His business has been for some time repairing machines here & there -, though he has built machinery, he says, home. He's got a wife & eight children, to move here. I should think him about 40 or 45 years old by his looks, though he has been sick considerable & that may occasion him to look older than he really is. Now I will tell you what I should have told at the beginning - that we recieved the bundle & letter by Mr. Cutts, which we are much obliged. Mother will get the Vest made as soon as she can, but Persis Sargent has been sick & I suppose is not able to do it yet, & Almeida has neglected her work so much to attend meeting that she is very much hurried & cannot do it. The Richards will be very acceptable to Charles I do not doubt. I should think it would be far cheaper to buy them ready made, than to buy the linen & make them if, (as I believe you wrote), you got them for 1\/ apiece. I wish, Isaac, if you can conveniently, you would before you come home get me a Hymn book. I want a small one, perhaps 4 inches long or so - if you have ever noticed Ellen Lee's you know what I want. We need another one, as the leaves are many of them out of one of ours.\n                          The boys have brought the Hydrangea home; it is alive & well - several new shoots have sprung up. I hope, Ann, you will think of me with a feeling of commiseration, as the crisis, as Joe calls it, is approaching.

It is not probable that it will be completed in season for us to move before the crisis, so we shall e'en stay in the shell & make no attempt to hatch or crawl out prior to that period. Afternoon Mother & Charles have just concluded not to try to move till just before haying, as the spring work is driving, so they think it inexpedient; as it is put off so long, I think it doubtful whether we get started before Snow comes, so I am going to do my best endeavours to fit up our parlor suitable for the reception of company. The boys are ploughing a spot in the north field for a garden, as the place by the house is so weedy. The boys have brought in several kinds of flowers this Spring - I suppose you have Lilacs. I have begun to collect specimens for an Herbarium. When you come home, Ann we will study Botany together, and when we get a suitable book, we will have a nice Herbarium like Joseph's & go snacks getting specimens. I don't expect to do much gardening this summer for lack of a good place & strength to take care of it; but I must entice Jimmy or somebody else to make me some flower boxes. I myself, I all alone made Eliab a pr of shirts entire, in 5 days this week, besides doing several other little matters, & Joseph has engaged the S. Circle to make him a pr. which they will finish next time they meet I suppose. I intended to have gone last time but it was too windy.\n\n                         The revival in Brownville is more interesting than ever it is said, especially in the north part, so much so, that Mr. Sewall & Wilkins could neither of them leave to come here this week & there has been no minister here except a Mr. Mayherd, (young man from Charleston) who was here two or three evenings. Major Furber thinks he experienced religion last week. When he was sick a year ago, he made many promises with regard to how he would spend his life if it was spared, which people think he has not performed; but he said at the commencement of the meeting that he thought he had kept them all. He now thinks differently about it. Mr. Richards says when this meeting is done he is going to hold a protracted meeting.\n                    You did not write anything about the vest which you sent up - do you want it made & sent back or shan't you want it till you come home. Monday morn. Mr. Cutter & Aron are going back this afternoon & we will send this by then. I went to meeting yesterday all day. Mr. Thibbets from Exeter preached in the forenoon & Mr. Strout from Brdaford in the afternoon - preached an excellent sermon from 1 Corinthians 1-30 - using up the Universalists, Deists, Infidels etc. etc. entirely.\n                    Amongst us ll we have made an awful looking letter I think. I fear you will not be able to read it - write soon - particularly\n\n[right-hand side] Ann we want to hear all about your school troubles & trials, employments & pleasures & all the rest.\nNota bene Isaac! Charles left his pant out? (and gloves in the pocket) at the tavern where he stay'd ?

After recess, recitations in Arithmetic, Colburn etc. etc. In afternoon little scholars read again, recitations, parsing and all the Classes spell.\n                         Her plan, which was very much liked was to let the scholars take places as they spelt, but yet she placed them every Thursday morning according to the number of marks each received for bad recitations, whispering, or any irregular conduct. The one who had the fewest marks, in each class, recieved a ticket at the end of the week and was placed at the head? Monday morning; and the scholar who, at the close of school, had the greatest number of tickets, had the promise of a small present. She thinks you will do well to follow, very nearly the same plan which she had last Summer - as they are used to that and were pleased with it. Mr. Fop was very much gratified with your letter and wishes you would write again though he is not able to answer it. He is very low indeed, and very childish. Expects to live, but a very short time - he has spoken to James to make a Coffin. He wants to give you a little advice about school-teaching says Ann is liked better than you boys, for a teacher because she is more strict and smart in school- more like a \"sheep's fore leg\" right up and down as Mr. Hale says. He says in order to get along you must be energetic, strict with the large scholars and not let them run over you. This is your \"natur\" and mine too to be too easy. That was the greatest trouble with me in my school, I was to pleasantly and softly as Mother says. You know Mr. Carrey at Bradford said","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95101,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95101","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f5c2d5d322d8b51f7c18aff24ebd192c.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f5c2d5d322d8b51f7c18aff24ebd192c.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f5c2d5d322d8b51f7c18aff24ebd192c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f5c2d5d322d8b51f7c18aff24ebd192c.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:06:03+00:00","modified":"2020-06-09T17:29:35+00:00","filename":"f5c2d5d322d8b51f7c18aff24ebd192c.jpg","authentication":"657cce379baaffbba6d41c147ad60090","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_30_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1179702,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2947,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.03706537721977200272593933050302439369261264801025390625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["010147"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["010147"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["010147"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f5c2d5d322d8b51f7c18aff24ebd192c.jpg","FileDateTime":1586653454,"FileSize":1179702,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2947\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2947,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 10:06:05","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:01 01:01:47","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:01 01:01:47","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":44,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2976,"ExifImageLength":3635,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1217,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1217","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"the scholars \"run over you,\" and the man at Brownville told Charley your was most too goodnatured.

A sheet and 1\/2 well filled with interesting matter; I will cheerfully take back a part, at least, of my rebuke on the score of \"letter writing.\"\n                  I have also this year written to Mother and Joseph. You seem to almost envy Charles & I our happiness at home: and I acknowledge that home, \"sweet home\" is the best of all places, be it never so homely. We have some \"cogie,\" nice times here, these long evenings, but still there seems to be something lacking. Once in a while, I cannot help thinking that we should be happier if one of the loved absent brothers, or the dear, dear Mother could step in and spend an evening with us. However, it is next to seeing them to recieve good, long, loving letters from them. We cannot expect, in this world, to be situated, for any length of time, as to enjoy uninterrupted happiness - there is always something to mar our enjoyment; and it is best for us that it should be so. If it were not, we should soon become so completely engrossed with our worldly cares and pleasures as to forget, in a great measure the higher duties which we owe to our Heavenly Father. You express fears for Charles,  that he is resting on the wrong foundation, etc. I also fear for him, and have felt many times that I ought to say something to him.

I am much obliged for the \"sermon\" and should have been very glad to hear the whole of it.\n\n          How I wish I could live where I could hear such sermons every Sabbath. I know it is in a great measure my own fault, that I am so little engaged in Religion - so dull and lifeless, and that I do not rightly improve the privileges which I do enjoy; but I think we here do not have enough to incite us; to stimulate. No prayer meetings, Monthly Concerts or any thing of the kind, where warm and holy feeling is called forth. We do not \"speak often one to another;\" and thereby, intercourse with Christians, and above all, by mutual prayer and supplication, obtain and retain in one heart, those precious influences of the life-giving Spirit, which the Christian must possess in order to be \"fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.\" Dear Brother pray for us. We are, as a church, cold stupid and heartless.\n          You must e cautious about getting prejudiced against Miss P. She is, I acknowledge, too talkative, and, as a matter of course, sometimes speaks injudiciously: yet there are very many good qualities in her. Reccollect, you see very little of her, except at meal-times etc. etc. when she is more engaged about other things, & pays less attention to children etc. She does know how to govern, and take proper care of them, but sometimes gets so much engaged talking as to entirely forget them. Are her children troublesome in school? With regard to sundry evil reports concerning your school - you must \"love down slander.\" Is'nt that good advice?\n         I have lately been reading \"Paradise Lost\" - and wonder that I never did the thing before. I have \"read it round a little\" sometimes, but never got really interested in it before. It is certainly by far the most interesting poetry I ever read. I always loved Pollock, and thought nobody could quite equal him. What a description of the \"battle in heaven\"!  And how ingeniously he accounts for Eve's being decieved by the serpent. I have wondered sometimes why she was not surprised by the serpent knowing how to talk. But according to Milton, he explains that in a very natural cunning manner; \"That he had eaten of the tree of knowledge,\" and if she would do the same, her knowledge would be increased in like proportion. Charles has percieved with great apparent interest, though he says little about it, Paradise Lost, Juniry?, Heathern Gods, The Wealth etc. etc. Mr. Gilman is very much interest just now in M. Fingal. I very much fear that he does not exert a good influence over Charles, in every respect -though I like him on most accounts very well. He is a Fatalist, or very nearly so.

If you conclude to go through College, I do not wish to have you pay, or furnish me with any funds, because you will need yourself all that you can have, and what we can help you to besides; but if you do not go I spose I shall have to draw upon you some (that is, with your permission) it takes two to make a bargain besides what Joseph can let me have. The I can teach school next summer & thereby repay you. But as we have aforesaid, - of you do go, we are all willing to help you as much as lies in our power. Do you have your scholars draw maps?

Our Mother at the mill, has every scholar who can write, write compositions, which are read every Sat. afternoon. Francy A. Cutts says she is pretty good at Composition, and she got so used to reading them at Foxcroft, that she don't care anything about it here. Did she ever read any there? Olive Furber has done going to school, because she could not get an Algebra. I wish you could come home again before the term commences up there. but I suppose it would hardly be worth while to come so far, unless for something necessary. I want to \"talk over matters\" - you know Charles never will say much but \"I don't know\". I have got to the Appendix in Arithmetic. Charles helps me etc. evenings. I shall be through soon. Shall you need any pairs of stockings before Mother comes home? I will get your mittens done so to carry them if I go to Foxcroft and if not C. will go before long. He is going to Bangor next week. Mr. Gilman is going to take the horse and sleigh over Monday for him. He reserved one journey to Bangor where he sold it.

Jan. 23rd I must finish this today I suppose if I can have an opportunity to send to the P.O. tomorrow and may not have another before Saturday. I have not heard from Joseph since you was at home - suppose his school closes next week. Have you found another for him? Charles has not. I saw a notice of Foxcroft Academy in the last week's Farmer, wherein your name, Isaac H. Metcalf was put. You have not said yet whether you should continue in the Academy next term or not. My pen is so grievous I can hardly write. If you do not come home be sure and write again before the term commences - won't you?\n             Have you found your pen knife? we have seen nothing of it here. Almeida wants to know if you will sell her some oats and peas and let her make your vest to pay. She has had one bushel, and would like some more if she can pay in that way.

He is to work fifty days now and the rest whenever C. wants it,- next year or year after.\n            James has found a new peace in the Bible  - or at least that he never noticed before, which proves (he says) beyond a doubt that the Jews are not to be restored.

I feel as if I had not seen you for a long time & want to write a great parcel, but cannot spare more time now, as we have got to get Joseph's trunk ready to send by Charles Monday.

I am very much afraid your books will get wet, it is so rainy, but I hope not. I am very sorry, dear brother, if I said too much about your boarding place, as I am afraid I did, from your note which came in the bundle.

I don't know enough, and ought not to have advised.\n                           The more I think of it, the more I think it was unkind in me to say so much about your boarding place; but I hope I shall learn a little wisdom one of these days. ..I hope you will like at Mr. C's.\n                           Saturday June 1st.

So you see I am schoolless yet. I wish you would keep a little watch, & perhaps you may hear of a school, to begin late, which I could take. There seems to be very little to do at home this Summer that will bring any profit. I want very much to teach a while this Summer to get a little money for you. I shall not need it particularly myself, but I want to do my part towards helping the rest.\n                          Ann is at home today- goes back with Mr. Wilkins tomorrow. Her school is quite pleasant she says - not as hard as the one at Foxcroft - about sixty scholars.

The scholars are all very pleasant, obedient and docile, and I guess all well Satisfied with Joseph, with the exception of Stineford, & perhaps one or two others.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95125,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95125","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/11c0f71ffba63aa864530426c7d7a625.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/11c0f71ffba63aa864530426c7d7a625.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/11c0f71ffba63aa864530426c7d7a625.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/11c0f71ffba63aa864530426c7d7a625.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:06:35+00:00","modified":"2020-06-13T02:53:04+00:00","filename":"11c0f71ffba63aa864530426c7d7a625.jpg","authentication":"57ff5ec6c389a463640bbbdb2a774923","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_31_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1567430,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2935,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04944886112688499923972784699799376539885997772216796875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000219"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000219"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000219"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"11c0f71ffba63aa864530426c7d7a625.jpg","FileDateTime":1586653455,"FileSize":1567430,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2935\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2935,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 10:07:03","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:04 00:02:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:04 00:02:19","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2767,"ExifImageLength":3393,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1217,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1217","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"at Macombers') John Philbrooks & other evil-minded person, - from what motive we cannot guess - had circulated all manner of false & ridiculous reports about the school, which had come to the Committee's ears.

Mr. C. knew not what to say, but seemed very certain that 'twas best to let such idle tales die a \"natural death\". Joseph talked well to them, & aid such things that if Cook, Holman etc. had not been friendly before, that would have made them so. He told them that Cook was there & could speak for himself. They questioned him & he said\" he knew of nothing out of which such a story could be manufactured\" etc.etc. They both found themselves mistaken & were evidently abashed, - both labored hard with many words to convince J. that they had the most friendly intentions towards him. Chad. in his remarks to the scholars said he was & had ever been friendly to him & to his family. Said he, \"we respect him, we love him\"- we are well satisfied that he is fully competent to instruct you in everything you wish to learn\" Macomber said he should be willing to affirm under oath that he was amply qualified  etc. etc. Told the scholars he understood that Mr. Metcalf thought him an enemy, but that it was a base slander, whoever had told him so etc.etc. Oh, they did talk silly.  The \"self convicted felon dies\" you know. Well, you see Billington told Charles that very day that Macomber, before he went away, after J. had engaged the school, had been round prejudicing the neighbors against Jo. & trying to make trouble. George Stineford said that if the Committee did not turn him out he & others would put him out. Philbrooks was outrageous because he was not turned out, - but I do not apprehend the least trouble. Joseph is a match for any of them, & they will find him so.\n\n                        But Chadbourn brought himself out at last finely - after he had finished his long & tedious, palavering speech to the school he turned to Joseph and said, \"from the manner in which you confronted me; when I first came in, I conclude you suppose I am? unfriendly\" etc. etc. ( a long pomade) He then went on to apologize for? his lack of words, wherewith to answer, when thus assailed!  Said it? was often the case, in matters of business, when he had a great many cares on his mind, (as at present with his school) that he could not collect his thoughts, immediately, enough to answer a question, when put to him, but it had just now come to his mind who it was that told him. Well you see the droll of it was, that not two hours before, he had told Charles of two or three who had been to him with complaints, but he dared not, just in those circumstances bring up for authority the names of a few unruly boys, who had threatened to turn the master out, before school begun, - But what a long story I have made; I am afraid I might have written something more interesting, though I believe you want to hear all about this. I did really intend to write a very serious sort of a moralizing letter this time, but I have filled it up with trash, as usual before I was aware of it. In my next I shall endeavor to moralize a little more. \n                   Our temperance Society, we ladies have named it the \"Phenix Temperance board -how you like it? Almeida gets along comfortably. They are all well. Judging from all accounts, Eliab gets along swimmingly- He has tact, you know. Joseph has got the scholars to writing themes; & intends to have them disclaim some. Your stationery was very acceptable to us all. Charles says he will pay you next time he goes down. Your copies are very well done. I did'nt know you could write so well. I have only this evening to write, & am sleepy & eyes sick, or I would write to Ann. If you have a chance you must let her read this. When you write next time, fill your sheet all over as thick as this page, will you?

To begin at the beginning, I went away from home last Sunday night, I was somewhat frightened about going with the cold, and did'nt hardly realise that you were going away to stay so long and altogether I almost forgot to tell you \"good bye.\"But you must take the will for the deed, and remember that I love you none the less.\n         Jenny and Wash. Hobbs were at Temperance meeting the same night; so I learned from them the particulars of the absquatulation of Donkey. A sorry fracus, wasn't it, considering all things. I conclude Mother was somewhat alarmed before Charley got safe home. But the worst of it was, your being so hindered about getting to Bangor.\n\nI suppose you failed of being at Brunswick at the Initiation you spoke about did'nt you? You seem to have some \"pull backs\" and troubles, but perhaps no more than are needful for you. Every one must expect his share you know. We will hope you'll have the less by and by.\n\n         If we were permitted to enjoy uninterrupted prosperity with no occasional downfall and trials to remind us on whom we are dependent for all our blessings, how soon should we forget and grow proud and self-dependent - get \"two big for our jacket\" and come to a bad end, as, according to parson Laurence, the king of Israel did. I heard a Mr. Laurence lecture at the Mills one Sunday eve this winter. Speaking of getting proud and above my station etc., he brought up, as an example (Jehosaphat was'nt it, I have most forgotten). Said the reason he was killed was he grew proud and swollen like the Frog in the fable, you know, and stretched his harness, so that, when the man drew a bow at a venture, it smote him between the joints of his harness, where by reason of his pride, he had stretched it apart. Was'nt that an ingenious interpretation? So he said God made us and place us where we belong; that is, made a harness to fit us, and if we stay put and do our duty without swelling, we are safe, otherwise must have something to humble us and bring us back within our proper limit. I suppose we ought to consider these little troubles & trials from which none are entirely exempt, as gentle admonitions from our allwise Father, intended for one good, to keep us humble, in the \"straight and narrow way.\" I do not doubt that I need this \"preachment\" as much to say the least, as yourself, so I will keep the rest to myself & tell you something about my school. My class in the Introduction read something  one day about the \"golden rule.\" I asked them, and every scholar in school, what it was. Not one could tell.  I found it in the Testament and told them to learn it. So they studied upon it most all the forenoon and afternoon, and when they came to spell? it at night, I demanded it of them, and said they, in the innocence and simplicity of their hearts, \"Whatsoever men do unto you, do ye upon to them.\" Don't you think I wanted to laugh?

I'll wish you all a kind good night.\nNow brother, if you presume to say that I can't fabricate \"Sager Poetry\" I will positively affirm that you are no judge.\nMonday Mar. 17th After school in the \"School 'us\"  Charles came after me Friday night, so I went home. Joseph had another Fracus with the S.S.C. the Saturday after you went away, (or rather with Mr. Theoph. Sargent). You know Mitchell told him to keep 14 weeks & Mr. S. was determined he should not keep but 12. Well that day (Sat), the day before town meeting when a new Com. would be chosen, Mr. S. went to the Com. & got them into the school with him, and he talked, and they talked, & inquired of all the scholars about the school but got no word of complaint. Chadbourn asked Angella Frost if she thought the school as profitable, & if she could learn as much as last Winter, (he kept last Winter you know) & she replied unequivocably in the affirmative! The Com. found no fault with the school, but for the sake of peace, they all three rather advised him to leave. But Jo. had no notion of pleasing Uncle Theoph. so much, so he kept on. As might he expected. Mssrs Sargent, Stineford, Fruman & John Philbrooks have taken their children away. Mr. Henry Sargent is very bitter against Theoph. Mr. Stineford refused to furnish any more wood & Aron Hill supplied the school with wood from his own pile, till he & Billington could have a load. You see Mr. Sargent has always ruled the District & it seems hard to him that he cannot continue to do it. He concluded that he should not probably be chosen Agent, thinking, probably that there would be Stinefords, Philbrooks etc. enough to put him in; but Billington told him to his face the other day, that he might set his heart at rest about it, for he could not come it this year.  One morning when Jo. went to school he found the back of the stove, & the door, carried off. Mr. John Livermore sent down to Mr. Freeman's to get some mortar to fasten it up with brick; The boy came back saying he could'nt get any. Livermore said he would go down & if he did not give him some, would cut this throat from ear to ear! He got some & with the help of Daniel Holman A. Cook etc. fixed it up nicely.\n\n      Eliab closes his school Sat. March 15th, having kept fourteen weeks. He has had quite a seige of it for the first time. Has grown poor the last two or three weeks considerable, having had a bad cold. Mssrs. Kimball, Hartwell, and Tolman were chosen S.S.C. - Very good ones, I think. Joseph (ever our Jo.) had a good many votes for 2nd & 3rd Com.- lacked only one or two votes I believe. Chabourn, Macomber & Kittredge had no office whatever. Turner, Day & Tolman Select men. Be it known unto you, the Select Men have laid out a Town road from Alder Station to the south bank of the Piscataquis at Sargent's, (on the top of the County road, remember) and there from the north bank of Piscataquis to Rich's corner, so called, leaving out the width of the river; - hoping you see that will induce the Commissioners to discontinue the Ferry.

You already know of my being in Bangor & of my occupation here, but have not probably been apprised that I passed through much tribulation ere I was finally established in my present situation. I wrote you a few words from Mr. Pomroy's Wednes. 4th. of June. The next morning I went in the stage with Ann & Mary Barnes as far as Mr. Dudley's to whom Mr. Walker sent a note by me informing the District that he had engaged me to teach the school. I left my trunk there as I came down the day before so they knew I was coming, & you boarded there. I felt almost acquainted with them; but instead of treating me like a friend, or even with the civility due to a stranger, they recieved me with all imaginable coldness, said Mr. Dudley had nothing to do with the business, that Mr. Sherburne was Agent & they believed he had engaged a teacher. They also told me, as of they did not know there was any such thing as feelings, that the District was very much dissatisfied with you, that you had no kind of order in school. that the scholars played chequers, spit on the master in school etc. etc. Mr. Dudley concluded by saying that you was a very clever fellow but that the would advise you never to attempt to keep school again if you could'nt keep the scholars from running over you so. Well I  soon made the best of my way over to Mr. Sherburne's , alias \"Uncle Sam's.\" He was gone to the city, so I waited in suspense till noon, when he came home. He had not engaged a teacher, but was awful wrathy at the Com. for sending a teacher when the school-house was all torn to pieces etc. Said the Com. took all the business in their own hands & then did'nt do it. People were also dissatisfied with my wages, as they said it was not customary to give","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95139,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95139","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/619fa6779867e52ec5eee240ae43e0c8.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/619fa6779867e52ec5eee240ae43e0c8.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/619fa6779867e52ec5eee240ae43e0c8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/619fa6779867e52ec5eee240ae43e0c8.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:06:54+00:00","modified":"2020-06-16T18:36:41+00:00","filename":"619fa6779867e52ec5eee240ae43e0c8.jpg","authentication":"4109542c09c47d5e70c7f59af59affb1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_31_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1395076,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2943,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04389184631454400020711403840323328040540218353271484375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000455"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000455"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000455"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"619fa6779867e52ec5eee240ae43e0c8.jpg","FileDateTime":1586653456,"FileSize":1395076,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2943\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2943,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 10:07:32","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:04 00:04:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:04 00:04:55","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2828,"ExifImageLength":3459,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1217,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1217","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"but 15\/ per week, whereof Mr. Walker engaged me for 3.00 and said I could get board for 1.00 & I do pay 7\/6 . The Committee have not visited me yet & I fear when they do come & find how the District feel about the wages, they will be unwilling to give so much. Well I thought at first considering all the untoward circumstances I had better go home again, but Mr. Sherburne rather advised me to stay & bustled round & got the house fixed etc. I felt very bad for a day or two, a great deal worse than I need to, but I could'nt help it.  Dudley's folks did actually insult me, & have continued to do so ever since I have been here. Common politeness requires them to call on me, even if I had been a perfect stranger., & certainly, as you boarded there, they ought to make some advance towards getting acquainted, or to say the least, ought not to have repulsed me when I made advances. But instead of that, they insulted me & hurt my feelings, a friendless & forlorn stranger. in their own house & since then I have been there three Sabbaths at meeting & they have never once spoken to me. I cannot imagine the reason of such unkind rudeness, but suppose there must be some grudge on your account some way. I don't know but they are so verdant that they don't know what civility is, not to mention politeness. Mr. Sherburne says Dudley's folks were ever so good & there was nobody like the master till you were gone, & then they were the first to express dissatisfaction & mention every little fault. From all I can gather I judge that you were hardly strict enough in school & that on that account or some other, people made up a sight of lies about you. Sam Bodge says it was a good school & the scholars leaned well, the only fault he found was, that you had no instrument wherewith to castigate the young'uns. Mr. More said his children never learnt better, but that there was a lack of order. Well I staid at Mr. Sherborne's  from Thurs. morn till Sunday, when I came to Moses Wiley's  to board. They live in the new house next the schoolhouse, where Philip Randall lived last winter. Wiley boarded his wife at Mr. Clark's last Winter.

Refinement ditto as Mr. Wiley. They have one child eight months old. I have from thirty to forty scholars: forty, for a week or more past. Lydia Giles, the oldest & Julia Mower the next. A hateful mortal, the latter is'nt she? I suppose you can sympathize with me in my trials concerning her, Oscar Whitcomb Charles Graffan & the like, most especially Oscar Whitcomb, \"Seem if I should die\" sometimes when he's reading. There are some exceeding bright ones, especially the Mowers girls & Barry Dudleys youngest, Emily.\n\n             July 4th Visited at Berry Dudley's by invitation, & met there the Dudley girls. On being introduced by Mrs. Wiley, we saluted each other & not another word passed between us, till when they started home.  They asked me to call on them. I am not usually so stuffy, but in this case I am determined to \"stand upon my dignity.\" I like Mrs. Berry Dudley very much. I am some acquainted at Mrs. Clark's. Have called on Mrs. Buchanan & Gullin's also up on the Kasey road. Must go up Garman way next week. I liked the appearance of folks at Mr. Kasey's, also at Mr. Mower's, but Mrs. M. is rather forbidding in her manner at first. I think I shall like her. I guess you did'nt visit enough, here did you? I close my school with singing. There are here some very good singers. I do love to hear little children's voices don't you? They have learned quite a number of new tunes since school commenced. I fear you cannot read this for I am very warm & tired & my hand trembles so, I write just as fast as I can. The boys were up to see me last Sabbath afternoon. Mr. Wiley's people have company every Sunday, laughing & carrying on. I have no table in my room & am forced to do all my writing in my lap, or go out in the warm kitchen, which is grievous. Every body has their disagreeable things to get along with you know. We have meetings here every Sabbath and S. School. Some of the Students preach. Folks don't turn out to meetings any hardly, & only a dozen, fifteen or twenty children attend S.S. \n             I should'nt think the Students would try to help them. I want you should write to tell me who are the clever folks here if you know. Also I want to know all about yourself. Do write me a long letter with lots of good advice. You know I am alone here. I have'nt seen the boys but once. I received a note from Joseph yesterday. He said he had written to you. Tell me all about your visit at Boston. I am infiniment obliged for your lettre Francais. Shall not dare attempt an answer in kind, at present. I am progressing slowly in French, as I have time & opportunity but I need a teacher. I do wish with you, that I could have the benefit of your Libraries. I long for something tor read. Have'nt any thing here hardly. How miserable poor wretches like me do feel, who have just been permitted to dip into the fountain of intellectual enjoyment, and therein to realize its sweetness  & then are obliged to stand aloof & see others drink their full. while they hunger & thirst. However, \"I'm thankful for what I got, but I want some more.\"\n            Mother writes that Mary Barnes is happy as a kitten. I feared she would be homesick. They take comfort there, I expect, but it is rather an unfavorable season for farmers, I should think. I fear Charles will not realize his expectations. He laid out pretty largely this year.\n           Mrs. Wiley and I went out in \"Uncle Sam's\" pasture for Strawberries tother day & a wicked, unbroken, five year old colt came at us full speed, his ears lopped & looking cross as could be. We would throw clubs at him & then run till he got most to us & then throw things again & in that way we managed to get out of the pasture. I fainted almost away when I got out of the pasture, or came so near it that I saw \"men as trees walking.\" I suppose we barely escaped with our lives. He would have stamped us under his feet if he had got to us. It makes me tremble every time I think of it.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95141,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95141","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5ff92dec8788fce995c0be953808b669.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5ff92dec8788fce995c0be953808b669.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5ff92dec8788fce995c0be953808b669.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5ff92dec8788fce995c0be953808b669.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:06:57+00:00","modified":"2020-06-16T19:32:04+00:00","filename":"5ff92dec8788fce995c0be953808b669.jpg","authentication":"202b395b4b36ed48e47a73ee737cca66","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_31_004_004_o2.jpg","size":1356101,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2995,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0419248438755950025846885864666546694934368133544921875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000505"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000505"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000505"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5ff92dec8788fce995c0be953808b669.jpg","FileDateTime":1586653456,"FileSize":1356101,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2995\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2995,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 10:07:37","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:04 00:05:05","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:04 00:05:05","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":33,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2828,"ExifImageLength":3399,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1217,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1217","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"One day this week the School house caught fire on the roof.

I found it too far to walk to Mr. Wiley's after they moved, and could find no other place excepting Dorr's.  He lives here this summer, having taken the mill here, or a part of it. I have no particular objections to the place excepting for the name of it. I am certainly much better accommodated here than at Wiley's. M. D. purchased table, chairs, glass lamps etc. etc. for the occasion.

I do not consider that there is any natural difference- I have nor pride enough for that.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95146,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95146","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/dc2949471dd433c47d06dad21d89a782.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/dc2949471dd433c47d06dad21d89a782.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/dc2949471dd433c47d06dad21d89a782.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/dc2949471dd433c47d06dad21d89a782.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:07:03+00:00","modified":"2020-06-17T01:04:37+00:00","filename":"dc2949471dd433c47d06dad21d89a782.jpg","authentication":"2abd60e384ac8b7ad282b9d215b25eb3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_31_005_005_o2.jpg","size":1427284,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2997,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0440960713800220005520458244063775055110454559326171875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000632"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000632"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000632"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"dc2949471dd433c47d06dad21d89a782.jpg","FileDateTime":1586653456,"FileSize":1427284,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2997\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2997,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 10:07:48","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:04 00:06:32","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:04 00:06:32","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2835,"ExifImageLength":3405,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1217,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1217","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"but owing to education, & to the people and example of our most excellent Mother, my taste is so much more refined!

Mother & Charles have gone to meeting with Nelly, & I am alone with \"our Jane.\"\n             We are all very sorry that you are obliged to leave College this fall, but as it must be so we will hope 'tis all for the best. I suppose we might have contrived to send you some more money, were it not that Ann is trying to establish herself in a school again, (I suppose she wrote you about it; she commences tomorrow a private school of about sixteen scholars) and needed to use all the boys & all of us could furnish.  I had hoped to send you a part of my school money, but Ann wants all I can spare, which will not be as much as I expected, if I go to Bangor, as I shall need to expend more myself for dress etc. By the way, had I better go? I have about concluded to. Seems to be a pretty good chance. I am sorry for your ill luck Examination day. Why did'nt you say you was sick, & get excused? Do take care of your health. Being out so late evenings at your class suppers, bonfires etc. is not the thing for you. You were very fortunate about getting a ride to Turner. I hope you will have a pleasant time & enjoy yourself there this fall.  You must try & see how much good you can do among the Universalists.  Take care & keep on the \"right side\" of them, that is, so far as you can & be decided about the conscientious performance of duty. As they are the most influential party, your success in school may depend in a great measure, on fitting? their good will; yet, knowing your sentiments to be different from their own, they will probably respect you none the less for being firm & decided in your own course. \n        They might, & undoubtedly would, be pleased to have you join with them, & would like you all the better, but still, if you show yourself a firm, decided character, a Congregational Christian, yet always kind & affable to all; you will be more respected; your memory will be respected in after years. It is very pleasant indeed to be beloved by those among whom we are placed; but in some cases I think if we cannot be both respected & beloved, the former is not only the most preferable, but necessary.\n\n[top of letter upside down] Mrs. Monroe came from Foxcroft recently.

I do not mean low familiarity. You are in no danger of that. You have no taste for it; but from your manner, your scholars should feel that there is a difference between you & them; that you are really above them in a certain sense, & that a very important sense. I percieve I am writing quite a lecture, especially for a younger sister to an older brother, but I do it in true sisterly kindness & you must not be offended. I want you should always give me advice to reproof, when I am wrong, & caution when there is danger of going astray. In continuation of my subject, (the aforesaid lecture)  I think, from my poor knowledge of \"human nature,\" and from various circumstances that have come to my knowledge, as well as from your own account, that you would have been more successful as a teacher in the far famed Sherburne District, City of Bangor, had you been more distant, dignified & commanding in your manner, & less familiary. You were very kind in the family where you boarded & very accommodating as a boarder but perhaps carried it a little too far; so far as in some measure to lose your authority, or at least injure it, & lessen the respect of others for you.  Bringing wood & water etc. for the Dudleys occasionally, was kind & accommodating in you & was doubtless rec'd so by them at the time, but still too much of any such thing, or of familiar conversation might, when thought over afterwards, seem like letting yourself down somewhat. Perhaps I am mistaken, however. I am \"young yet,\" & a few years experience may change my views, but it seems to me that a teacher who really eels kind & as he ought, may appear kind & affable & be sociable in a measure, with parents & scholars & still keep authority in reserve & not only have it in reserve, but let the scholars all feel that it is so. Mrs. Monroe, who is acquainted in Turner, says 'tis a very pretty place, the young folks are very sociable & clever etc. As for your social parties, I don't know as I would \"abjure them altogether\"; and yet if you go to one, and not to all, you may cause offense. When you go you will distinguish yourself by your good sense & intelligence rather than by great ease of manners & expertness at too little than too much, in speech & manner,\" Students,  (i.e.) literary character are not expected to possess that ease & polish of manners which those do who are accustomed to society & have had constant intercourse with the world for years. 'Tis not their trade. Their business is with the inner, rather than the outer man. Something of this same ease of manner is, to be sure, desirable & necessary to every one, but, according to","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95150,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95150","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f98a22400069bf4ebccf8b17c7b77f01.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f98a22400069bf4ebccf8b17c7b77f01.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f98a22400069bf4ebccf8b17c7b77f01.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f98a22400069bf4ebccf8b17c7b77f01.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:07:08+00:00","modified":"2020-06-18T01:51:34+00:00","filename":"f98a22400069bf4ebccf8b17c7b77f01.jpg","authentication":"792edb04013ed6ea9d1d3cc3c06d751c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_31_006_003_o2.jpg","size":1417988,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2242,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058561634783757997302355846613863832317292690277099609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000733"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000733"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000733"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f98a22400069bf4ebccf8b17c7b77f01.jpg","FileDateTime":1586653456,"FileSize":1417988,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2242\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2242,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 10:07:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:04 00:07:33","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:04 00:07:33","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2761,"ExifImageLength":4432,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1217,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1217","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"my notions,\"you learned folks\" ought to have something of more depth & value on which to depend for success in life. Am I right? If not, enlighten me. Well, having discoursed upon moral policy & sentiment at a great length, I will now answer some of your inquiries  about my school etc. I got honorably through & closed up my business Friday Aug. 29th. Buchanan and some others desired me to stay & keep private school another month, but I prized my freedom too much to be again enslaved. I gave my scholars books the last day & every scholar in school save Oscar Whitcomb! returned some little trifle for me to keep as a memento. That was of course, quite gratifying to me. I could tell how well they like me you know, by the pains the parents took to fix up something to give. Mond. afternoon, before the close, we had a Pic Nic. Some 50 or 60 present including the scholars.  Very pleasant time; principally under direction of Mr. James, who came into school two or three times talked to the children, found a Cold Water Army etc.  Folks in that region, you know are very queer, remarkably unsophisticated etc. Did'nt 1\/2 of then know what a Pic Nic was -never one of them been to one but me. I took the sole charge, making preparations, selecting a spot etc. Some called it \"Pig beat,\" others \"Pig meat,\" \"Pit Nic, Pic Nit, and so on. Laughable business, I assure you. However, we got the table prepared in fine style, in a beautiful grove back of Mr. Edison's house, & about 3 o'clock Mr. James came up from the City. Parents & scholars, all who went, except a 1\/2 dozen young ladies, Garmans, Lydia Giles. Emma Clark etc. who staid at the grove, assembled at the schoolhouse & marched in procession, shalled by the minister & school- ma'am to the grove, where we were recieved by the aforesaid young ladies with a spirited cold water song. We had a beautiful swing out there on two tall trees. We sung, laughed & talked eat & dranked  etc. & Mr. James read my old Temperance Address , which I had new moddelled to render it appropriate, & then rendered public thanks for \"Miss Metcalf's able Temperance Address.\"\n\n    We had, in addition, sundry toasts by Miss Metcalf & the Misses Garman. It is astonishing how those Dudley folks have acted this Summer. They would'nt go to the Pic Nic by the way, I understood by way of Mrs. Philbrooks many lies they tell about you. Many thing they say you said about me  which I know you never said. They say you praise me up so much & said so much about me, my beauty etc. that when they came to see me, they were actually disgusted with me could'nt bear the sight of me etc. Query, which is the most disgusting in appearance, Mary Jane Dudley or I? For awhile I thought perhaps the fault was my own, in part; & finally overcame my feelings so as to call there, although they never called on me. I have an excuse as Octavia was sick. Mary J. & Juliett treated me with base civility. Susannah came into the room & sat down, her back almost towards me & spoke not a word. I inquired kindly after Juliett's health etc. and took my leave without being asked to stay longer or to come again. Mrs. Berry Dudley had a long talk with me the night before I came away.  She told me she was up stairs with Juliett when I first came there & heard all that passed below. - her feelings were much hurt, she could have cried for me herself etc. Said after I went away, & Mis. J. Dudley came up stairs she told her she did wrong, she feared my feelings were hurt; Mis. J. Dudley said she did'nt care, hoped they were etc. She said they were strange girls. She did'nt blame me at all for the course.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95151,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95151","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/dfa015c9c4a4f20267ed30df4812aa3b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/dfa015c9c4a4f20267ed30df4812aa3b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/dfa015c9c4a4f20267ed30df4812aa3b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/dfa015c9c4a4f20267ed30df4812aa3b.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:07:10+00:00","modified":"2020-06-17T19:45:04+00:00","filename":"dfa015c9c4a4f20267ed30df4812aa3b.jpg","authentication":"38e1d825da39a243feed18431516ae22","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_31_006_004_o2.jpg","size":1148999,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2250,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047283909465020999840501048083751811645925045013427734375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000737"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000737"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000737"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"dfa015c9c4a4f20267ed30df4812aa3b.jpg","FileDateTime":1586653457,"FileSize":1148999,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2250\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2250,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 10:08:01","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:04 00:07:37","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:04 00:07:37","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":5,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2741,"ExifImageLength":4384,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1217,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1217","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I had taken.

Intend to visit Ed. Snow's at the Mills some day. Do you know much about him? He enquired particularly about you. The story is, there is going to be a dancing school here this winter. Some of 'em had a full Thanksgiving evening. Went home after breakfast next morning! Gilman has not been here yet this winter. Is coming when Charles gets his timber. He has not yet been able to get any. There is more to be had for money. Labor is very high & scarce. Almeda finds it very difficult to get up her wood. Cannot without money in hand. Charles has sold both yoke of his oxen. Has only the colt to get up his wood. For the oxen he got 25 in money, which he laid out 37 I believe. The rest a draft on Walter Brown which he gave to Joseph- house and clothes. The steers he sold for beef in Bangor, and paid the money away to men whom he owed. Mosier, Lake etc. He wants much to sell Donkey. He is threatened with a cost on his taxes, which last year were 60, and probably as much or more this year.  He has so much to do & no help that I don't know how he will get along. Every body has their troubles you know. He no more than many others; perhaps.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95156,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95156","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/bca59028242da41720a7d7cd10a57323.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/bca59028242da41720a7d7cd10a57323.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/bca59028242da41720a7d7cd10a57323.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/bca59028242da41720a7d7cd10a57323.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:07:16+00:00","modified":"2020-06-18T03:11:50+00:00","filename":"bca59028242da41720a7d7cd10a57323.jpg","authentication":"3b94166294ebeb40983246fc87dd4163","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_31_007_005_o2.jpg","size":1292921,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2936,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0407748322232310000945432193475426174700260162353515625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000855"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000855"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180604"],"TimeCreated":["000855"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"bca59028242da41720a7d7cd10a57323.jpg","FileDateTime":1586653457,"FileSize":1292921,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2936\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2936,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 10:08:11","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:04 00:08:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:04 00:08:55","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2801,"ExifImageLength":3434,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1217,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1217","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"part relating to the Oregon Question.\n\n We'll take back all insinuations, advice etc. about matters and things, when you make choice of some sensible, discreet, amiable person, which I would do as soon as I had decided \"what to do for a living\" and how to do it!

He came from there Wednesday. A man thought he should like to buy the horse, but could not tell certainly till monday. He wished C. to leave him there and if he did not purchase, would pay the expense till Monday. Charles tried him, under disadvantageous circumstances too, and found that he can trot with ease a mile in four minutes; and he is confident that with a week or ten days \"training he may be crowded into a mile in 3 1\/2 minutes; if that is the case he can be sold for 150 dollars. The manager of the Theatre offered that for him if he could do it in 3 1\/2 minutes, and several told C. that Frank Adams would give that for him. If that man concluded to buy, he goes for 75; if he does not, C. is going to raise the price immediately to 150, keep him there in a stable, and let Eliab drive him out every morning, till he find a purchaser. Some say he can be trained by the time he is seven years old, to trot a mile in three minutes, in which case he would be valued at 300 dollars, but C. thinks it doubtful. I hope he will get a  good round price for him after waiting so long, but it would not spite Noah Dow awfully.\n\n            I wish you had taken the other ten dollars of Charles.

I am a stranger in a strange land and do pine to see and hear from some of my kindred and acquaintances. Won't you write me a good long letter soon and continue to do so often. I board about 1\/4 of a mile from school at one Mr. Kenney's, where are seven very pretty children, the oldest not quite ten years old.\n              I have about 40 scholars (from 40 to 50) and the oldest only thirteen years old!

Many thanks for the same, dear brother. I had an opportunity to go home with Dr. Kimball, & accordingly dismissed my school for three days while Ann was at home. Had a fine time went blueberrying twice and did not get a dozen berries either time. Too late in the season for them. Charles and Albina came and brought me back Sabbath night after meeting. My school closes next Tues. I long for the time of my release to arrive. Every family in the District without an exception have beset me to come again next Summer. The Agent tried to make me promise; says I shall have as much wages as I can get anywhere else, more or less! I conclude from all this that I have given good satisfaction.\n             Your \"Proverbial Philosophy\" I am much pleased with. Should admire to get hold of the book. The \"Crock of Gold\" I have read. Came across it here in Lagrange. Like it very much. The person of whom I borrowed it had not read it, thought 'twas'nt much - nothing but a story etc.  I thought from my knowledge of the individual it would be an excellent plan of he would read it or & put it to practical use! I gave him \" a piece of my mind\" when I returned the book.\n              Your unsealed letter was postmarked in due form at Brunswick. No harm if a few Lagrangers did read it! I suppose you know that Mr. Walker is remarried. Joseph writes about \n\n[left-hand side] I do want to send you some of my money, but I am owing Ann most pay of it & don't know as it will be possible. I am very sorry you are obliged to leave College this fall for money, when there is so much of it in the world! But there's no consolation to it.

After service the parson announced that a solemn ceremony would tale place. Asa and his elect lady came forward and were wedded then and there. or to speak more concisely, they approximated and were hitched.\" Droll fellow, Jo. I had the pleasure of seeing Daniel Holman & his \"elect lady\" the last time I was at Milo. Rather an old looking bride considering the youth and beauty of the bridegroom.\n\n          Perhaps am account of one of my visits would not be uninteresting to you. Last Sat. night I was invited to a place (where is a grand house & everything nice & comfortable) to tarry all night & go to meeting next day at the corner. When I got part way there I learned that the lady of the mansion had been suddenly called away by sickness, so I could'nt go there.  It was so far (about two miles) that I could'nt very well go home, besides as my intention was to spend the night was known, I should give offence if I did not stop were I then was. (You know, as \"Aunt Kesiah\" says \"folks like to be taken notice of if they are poor.\") Accordingly I tarried.  A very 'exiguous\" house, containing one room, and I suppose one chamber, as I saw persons ascending and descending a ladder occasionally, also a trap door through which ingress and egress was had to a small hole under ground, by some denominated a cellar, wherein was deposited milk, butter and divers other edibles wherewith the inhabitants were wont to satisfy the demands of nature.

But, good \"Brudder\" are you aware that said letter travelled all the way from Brunswick hither, minus a seal? Quite a mistake of your, was'nt it? I've been joked about open love letters considerable. It lay in the P.O. a while, then came and stopped at Mr. Trott's over night, and finally spent the day at my boarding place while I was at school! Divers people were blessed with an opportunity to peruse it, if so disposed, and I doubt not they were. Don't know how they relish your tyrade about \"low wages and other folks brats\" etc. , nor care, - they've no business peeping into it.\n            My school is half done. I begin to peep through to the end, though the remaining four weeks look long to me in prospect. It continues pleasant as could be expected from so large a school of small scholars. I have had to punish but one yet, which I think is doing pretty well considering that I keep them in excellent subjection.

Ann went home determined to take me back with her. 'Cordinly' here I am. She needed my assistance in school, and I board at a place (Sidney Thaxters, Houlon St.) where half a dollar per week is paid in tuition - three children go to Ann's school - and I knit & sew evenings to pay the rest.\n               The oldest child, a girl nine years old, is lame by nature - can with difficulty walk, and one reason they wanted me to come is on account of helping her to school. I have a very pleasant situation - will be very beneficial to me on many accounts. Very clever people here I guess. Open hearted, generous sort of folks. My greatest source of uneasiness is for Mother.  She wants my company as well as help. She must feel very lonely. Do try & write to her often, won't you, also to me. We are very much indeed obliged for Proverbial Philosophy. I like it exceedingly. No book you could have sent would please us better. I help Ann some in school, & some I draw & study French.

an application from La Grange to teach school this winter) as it must be used sometime & as well now perhaps as any time. Your letter of the 26th alt. was rec'd in due season, for which please accept my hearts thanks.\n              It certainly does one good to recieve letters from ones friends. As Proverbial Philosophy says, \"and should it thou ask my judgement of that which hath most profit in the world, For answer take thou this - the prudent penning of a letter.\" What a book that is - it has something on every subject, for every occasion. So many wise sayings, beautifully though oddly expressed, and always so true to nature. I am almost afraid I shall quote it as Scripture sometime, as friend Walker's class do Shakespeare. One of them quoted a passage from that Author as Scripture. Mr. W. told him it applied very well, but was taken from Shakespeare, not Bible. The fellow turned the joke by saying that Shakespeare was quoted so often by their teacher that he supposed it might pass current!","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95192,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95192","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/dbefa8f3b3ac4de5e02cbfd526e0432a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/dbefa8f3b3ac4de5e02cbfd526e0432a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/dbefa8f3b3ac4de5e02cbfd526e0432a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/dbefa8f3b3ac4de5e02cbfd526e0432a.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:08:07+00:00","modified":"2020-06-20T19:09:49+00:00","filename":"dbefa8f3b3ac4de5e02cbfd526e0432a.jpg","authentication":"f32c00c5ff993ddacf397eca0ab803ed","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_32_011_002_o2.jpg","size":1551311,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2918,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049225465184170001664565319288158207200467586517333984375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["025116"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["025116"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["025116"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"dbefa8f3b3ac4de5e02cbfd526e0432a.jpg","FileDateTime":1586653459,"FileSize":1551311,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2918\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2918,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 10:20:56","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:08 02:51:16","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:08 02:51:16","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2982,"ExifImageLength":3678,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1217,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1217","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Poor 'Asa' has no mercy shown him by any body now a days, unless it be by the members of his beloved fireside circle. I am very glad you went your journey & glad you enjoyed it so much. Wish I could have gone with you too! Am content to remain in blissful ignorance with regard to the particular business of your journey.\n\n               Our Lowell cousins seem to be somewhat dispersed, but prosperous, notwithstanding, are they not? So you saw \"Uncle Jo.\" Large as life, I suppose. Trafton & Richer (our old school-fellows, you know) board near by me, so near that I have the pleasure of seeing \"Billy the less\" every day as he passes to & from his place of business. He looks more sensible than he used to.\n              I do to Singing School two evenings in a week to one Mr. Lucas from Mayo? He presented Ann with a ticket & I use it. He makes great pretensions, and is, I think, an excellent teacher, though a very disagreeable man - egotistical, self important and cross. I am in William Dow's class in Sab. School, as is also Sarah Harlow. By the way, I was informed by way of Albina Kittredge and Lucretia Hashell that you were very partial to the said Sarah, and that she was equally partial to you! Correct report or not?\n          I must tell you of the splendid Antiquarian Concert at Hammond St. New Year's eve. All the old folk got together and sing all the old tunes and Anthems they could find. I do wish Mother could have heard them, she would have enjoyed it so much.

However I'll try to communicate what I wish, though not, perhaps, in a very systematic manner.\n                 Ann & I came home Monday Mar. 1st ( a very cold; windy day) with Charles. About a fortnights before that, little Freddy Thaxter died. Mr. T's youngest - a beautiful boy of eighteen months. He was sick about three weeks. I had helped take care of him some, watched one or two nights etc. and what with fatigue, excitement and a severe cold, got \"run down,\" so that for a week before I came home was quite sick, threatened with fever etc. but as good luck would have it, happened to be at Mrs, Shepherd's, and she nursed me up nicely was very kind indeed.

We wished you, and Almeida too, could have been here on the memorable occasion. Charles gets married so seldom that I really felt quite disappointed at not seeing him. We often talk about it & feel very bad that there cannot be more done for you, but know not how to help it. There is justly due you from Charles a hundred dollars, but with the present peculiar management of affairs here, it seems to be hard work each year to live along, & pay the taxes. I did feel really grieved when the colt was sold & found that nothing was going to you, and Charles seemed to feel as bad as anybody but it seemed impossible to do it. I cannot but think that if some men had the management of C's property it might be made to yield much more profit; still I do not attribute blame to him. He is not gifted by nature with a capacity for \"getting a living\" as some men are & for that reason I see no prospect that it will ever be different with him. Nevertheless, when worst comes to worst, he generally contrives to get along some way & do what must be done; - for that reason, I do hope & believe he will be able to do something for you this summer. I think he wants to as much as we can want to have him. I wish it was in my power to help you, but instead of that I have to be helped by the boys.

He thinks, talks and concludes a great deal about it, and really wants to pay you but I fear if he succeeds in doing anything, it will be a little too late. He is a dear good brother willing to do - all he can.

You will not be surprise perhaps. when I tell you that I have at length decided the question and given him an affirmative answer to his proposal. I have been long in making this decision, but have now concluded it right and best.\n\n          At home, where all has always been sunlight and happiness, with kind friends who have ever been tenderly thoughtful of my welfare, has this far been my lot, and I don't know as I have any reason to doubt the continuance of this happiness with another home and a new friend, but I know not what may be before me. I can hope & trust. To you, and to all my brothers, I feel that I owe a debt of gratitude  which I can never repay. For all your kindness, and especially for the tender regard for my feelings which has ever been manifested, I most sincerely ad heartily thank you all. If I felt perfectly sure of recieving from another friend, the kindness, in every respect, which I have always recieved from my brothers, I would ask no more, and even though I have perfect confidence in the sincerity and strength of his attachment, still it is not without a deep struggle of feeling that I can look forward to the day when I shall forsake, as it were, the home of my childhood, and those beloved ones who have ever proved true and kind, to seek a new home and entrust the keeping of my happiness to a new friend.

We yearn to know all about you - your business every day etc. if you are so far away from us. Hope you will continue good in that as every other respect. We shall feel very anxious about you through this long cold winter. Shall think of you often while we are warm and comfortable around the fire, and you away so far from us, exposed to so much cold and wind and storms. \n          Nevertheless we are glad for you- because you seem to feel that you have succeeded beyond your expectations in obtaining a good situation. You did not write what are to be your wages, nor anything about it. You complain that it was a long time before you heard from home after you went away, and so it was. But you reccollect in your first letter from Mass. you did not tell us where to direct letters to you, and we knew not where you might be. I wanted to write, and should had I known where. Am glad your shirts, bosoms etc. suited you. We found another pair of pants after the things were sent to Bangor which ought to have been put in. Your Geology I thought of intended should have sent - also Magnet, shaving box, and some other things, but Mother thought you would not wish to have your trunk encumbered with many books etc. \n   It is very cold - squally - today. Charles is at work on Hoxie hill - joined drives, he said. Hiram digging potatoes - most done, sorted considerable.

Almeda and the children prosper as usual. Jamie is a real good steady little boy - has done most all his mother's harvesting this fall! It has rained a great deal within a few weeks. The river is very high. Have been expecting a freshet. Mr. Sargent bought the Sebec and Atkinson ferry boat a few weeks since of one of the select men, and took it down here. Mr. Cushing had previously bought it of another one and insisted on keeping it - so he hired men to take it down river & up the Sebec to the mills. They got it fastened on a rock where it yet remains, entirely under water, broken to pieces by the dashing waves - in an ungetoffable  place. Total loss. Mr. Sargent  felt quite disturbed about it at first. Charles had a fine lot of corn - between 50 and 75 be. he thinks. More than half husked. Has ploughed up all the east field. Getting along finely with fall work. Eben Greenleaf has broken up housekeeping.  Children all sent away. Col. Lee and wife are going to live with Ellen at Brownville this winter.  Aron and Martha have gone. He to Iron Mountain - she to Oxford. Hector Sargent has moved into his house. Old lady Hill lives alone in her part. Abby gone to Lawrence married. Marshall there too. Nathan Sargent married to Mr. Cushing's wife's sister - lives on the homestead. Lucretia Hashell is not married. Is in a tailor's shop at Bangor.

I spose you percieve that my pen is very bad, but 'tis late, and I can't spare time to go after another. We begun today to hold meetings in the hall.

Shepherd - How the very day he put up his publishment, his \"lady love\" wrote to him that her \"affections were centered elsewhere\"? Alas! poor Pres! I pity thee - though in very truth, I cannot restrain my laughter. I did dislike him very much indeed. I have not finished the Herbarium yet, but intend to do it very soon. I hope also to get time in the course of the winter to draw a mourning ? for Father. I have a very pretty pattern.

28th 1847.\n\nDear Brother Isaac\n\n                          It is sabbath day. Mother and I at home alone. Mr. Jones, our Baptist brother, preaches and writes letters to one's kindred sabbath day, but I do not consider it a very good practice generally. In my case at present, however, I do not feel condemned, for it is very seldom now-adays that I can have the quiet of a week day that I like when writing. We do not usually keep a fire in the sitting room, and you know what our little  kitchen is in the cold weather when we are all in it. Nevertheless 'tis quite a comfortable place. \n      Thanksgiving eve we rec'd, via Bangor your last letter dated Nov. 6th which we were much rejoiced to see, as we had been wondering for some days why we did not hear from you. Charles and Albina went home to \"Father Kittredge\" to spend Thanksgiving. Returned at 10 o'clock P.M. bringing your letter etc. Almeda and the children were here. Hiram gone away. We had a fine time all to ourselves with nobody but little Jamie to \"carve the Turkey,\" alias chickens! I did wish you were here. I wanted to see you for one reason; and \"agin\", as Jos. use to say, the stuffing was too highly seasoned for me, and would have just suited you! Was'nt that a good reason? I cooked all the Thanksgiving up alone, to learn how! I fear we don't think enough about having thankful hearts. the time is too much taken up getting dinner. Almeda went home before dark. Mother & I spent the evening alone, together\u00a0!- as we love to dearly - I read in Upham to her, and she listening, knitting with her eyes shut. Can't you see us both, with the table out before the stove? I have got most through Upham. Have read it all loud evenings, knitting meanwhile. Charles has been very much engaged with Smellie's Natural Philosophy.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95224,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95224","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/706754229a206a617e523a815eeca8ad.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/706754229a206a617e523a815eeca8ad.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/706754229a206a617e523a815eeca8ad.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/706754229a206a617e523a815eeca8ad.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:08:52+00:00","modified":"2020-06-22T22:09:05+00:00","filename":"706754229a206a617e523a815eeca8ad.jpg","authentication":"9c5a865c7e740c041b3af11270646f02","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_33_008_002_o2.jpg","size":1761736,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2944,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05540886674718199789158035173386451788246631622314453125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["025814"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["025814"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["025814"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"706754229a206a617e523a815eeca8ad.jpg","FileDateTime":1586653460,"FileSize":1761736,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2944\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2944,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 10:22:06","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:08 02:58:14","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:08 02:58:14","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2990,"ExifImageLength":3656,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1217,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1217","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I am glad you left your books here. Don't know what we should have done this winter without them. I never did pine so much for something to read as winter before last when I was here at home, and the summer following at La Grange. Is'nt it aggravating when there are so many good books in the world, to be so situated as to be deprived of the benefit and comfort of reading them? I am if anything more than usually hurried with work this winter, but I do read evenings constantly. We have very little company, and go from home but little - nowhere to go - Baptist preaching once a fortnight in the S. of S. Hall, which arrangement people generally dislike. The brother in law of Mr. Jones ( McGregor) hires the hall himself. Mr. Sewall will probably preach four times in the course of the year commencing in June last. The Teachers Institute I did want very much to attend - but - could not. Olive and John Furber, Stephen Kittredge etc. went. Had a very interesting time. Mr. Gillan from N.Y. and several other big folks there. Good many strangers. I am thinking of going to Bangor to spend two or three weeks by and by. Suppose I can go and return without expense. You say Kibils are \"miserable things,.\" \"Sour grapes,\" eh? for you and I! I should much like a few, at any rate when I got to B. Samuel has business - scaling I believe - at Orono a somewhere down that way, to do which he will leave Milo every Monday morning, and return sometime last of the week, so I can probably get a ride to Bangor, if I wish to go - only he has got an abominable contrary horse. One Jos. took for debt - you know about it, I guess. It has been here two or three months, ever since you went away, till Eliab was up week before last and took it back. He and Charles tried all one day and could not make him go. Would throw himself down, and 'stay put' in spite of all their efforts and castigations. Samuel liked the beast I suppose and bought him for 75.00. He seems to have a passion for Donkeys, judging from his partiality for the old Pony and me! I will wait till I know when before I ask you to come home next Spring!

We joked him about Lizzie Quimby's marrying Fellows and going off, having an effect on his health and spirits! I suspect, and he intimated, that there will be the considerable effort and maneuvering by the Browns in May Marston's behalf. Guess E. does'nt like her very much.

I have an idea from all I have heard of her that she is very handsome, very witty, very accomplished etc. etc. As for Cousin Maria I suppose her to be a great good-natured, common sense, strong minded girl, very much like Uncle Joseph. Aunt and cousin Hannah I did very much dislike, and all I hear confirmed my former feeling. The rest I know nothing at all about only that Aunt Conant is very homely and very clever, and that Aunt Esther don't know how to manage children.

Was carried into the woods by a Mulatto. They have a hospital camp in the woods and are not supposed to bring any more out to Brownville. Dr. Shepherd has had the Varioloid. Our schools are all stopped for four weeks and Dr. Kimball is employed by the select men to vaccinate. \n  Some people are more easily frightened  than is meet, you know. We had no meeting today, and shall not probably have many all winter. No preaching at all but Mr. Jones; he has withdrawn his stated appointments, but will be here occasionally.

Charles could not sell the Oxen. Hired 72 dollars of Jo Chase at 24 per cent interest. He would probably have been able to sell them, but there had not yet been any sledding - every prospect of another rain now - do few teams have gone into the woods, and a part of those have been frightened, or obliged to come out by small pox. Lumberers will make a poor winter's work unless there come snow and cold weather soon. Charles went to Bangor yesterday. Started with a sleigh. Will probably hire a wagon before he gets there. If there comes a bit of snow, I expect to go to N. next Monday. Stay only a week or two.

Do you like to have me glad? Oh, I forgot to tell you that Sarah Parker from Foxcroft teaches the school in the Hobbs Neighborhood. Won't she conclude she has got bit? Mr. Buker came and besought me to teach it, but I steadfastly  refused. I must'nt write much more or Mother will begin to make complaint again. Have nearly filled one sheet, but after all written nothing worth sending. Must say as Sip, Furber did was learnt to wrote nonsense when I'd nothing else to write. I forgot to tell you about Theodore Furber. He has been at Wisconsin two years. He & his wife have both been sick more than half the time. When they wrote last, he had been confined to the bed eight days with billious fever, Frost destroyed their corn, and to crown all prairie fir burnt up all their wheat while he was too sick to take care of it. They are pretty much discouraged I guess. Should think they'd wish themselves back to N.E.

She has advise you of the birth of an \"heir presumptive\" to the house of Rich. It all happened while I was at Bangor - They all say tis handsome, but I say it looks like a monkey. What shall his name be? Olive and I call it Frank? I don't know as I've written you all about the small pox. A mulato man carried it from Bangor into the woods. from there it spread in to Brownville. People were very careless & it spread more than was necessary. People much frightened. Our schools are stopped after keeping a week, 4 weeks till all were vaccinated then commenced - kept eight days and the Vicarage school stopped again. People seem to understand that something may be done to them for their safety, but they make droll blunders as to what it is. One man went to the doctor desiring to be lacerated. Another thought people were in no danger from small pox after being annihilated  -a third inquired if the Dr. was going to evacuate the town of Brownville - afterward finding he had made a mistake, called it vackenate.

The 'prospect' you speak of had no tendency to diminish my affection for any of my friends - certainly not my dear Mother and brothers. The thought of leaving them all - in one sense - for another, renders them dearer, and makes me feel their kindness and love more than ever. I am so glad that you have really settled the matter that you will come home. I feared from a previous letter that ti might not be consistent. As Ann say, Mother has not many more daughters, to marry off, and it seems desirable that all should meet at home. Perhaps we shall not all be at home together very often except it be on some such occasion. I am very glad you are so strenuous about Mother's going to Mayo, with you in the Spring, for you know she never starts unless some one does urge, and make every thing plain for her. She needs the relaxation - Her health and spirits will both require it another summer. Besides it will be an excellent thing for Albina - learn her to depend upon herself, and value Mother. She don't know how much good Mother does here, and never will know how to appreciate her labors etc. unless Mother goes away a while.

I have another plan in my head. I want to go to Mayo very much.

Samuel says I may! - and escort Mother home. Would'nt you? I may never have a better time.\n\n            As for the time of the great occasion, as you call it, probably about the second or third week of May, but can of course be deferred a week or two if more convenient for you. Ann can have her vacation about that time. Charles must bestow himself to obtain some funds for Mother if she does conclude to go with you. She will need some addition to her wardrobe as well as other expenses. It would be neither right nor proper for you to furnish said funds if obtainable in any other way - especially considering that so much is already your due from here. You have debts too, for the payment of which you need to appropriate your spare funds, don't you?  to say nothing of laying by a store against your \"settlement in life\"! When are you going to think about that, or have you begun already?\n                     With regard to our little stranger whom you seem to take so much interest in, he is a pretty puck little fellow, as Eliab says, dark blue eyes, little face, large mouth pretty well puckered up.

He and Eliab spent last night here however and told me what was in it, so I am in part consoled. I am very glad, Mother, that you went directly to Warwick, as I think it will be easier for you, and you will enjoy it more than to visit about from place to place so long before coming to a stopping place. You will have a nice time to do your visiting and looking about Boston while Anne is there in the Fall.\n     Samuel went to Augusta the day after you went away. He had a fine time and enjoyed it much. I was very glad he went. I enjoyed myself nicely at Mrs. Shepherd's while he was gone - had an opportunity to do Mrs. Shepherd's shopping etc. Anne came home with us Thursday night after Samuel got back, and staid till the next night - would have staid till Sat. but had calls etc . to make before commencing her school. I have got my Mantilla done. Anne helped me - \"fixed it up\" - you know she always had to fix me, don't you?  I never feel - dressed when she is any where about, till she has fixed this and pinned that and pulled 'tother'! always take it as a matter of course that she will \"wrestle with my garments\" some way. She \"trained round\" finely the day she was here  - making innovations as you tell about! I was very glad of her help, as I had not got anything fixed hardly, and she is such a good hand to arrange, you know.

A very long man with a long cane and long whiskers, as also a long tongue, from Providence R.I. has just been in to get me to subscribe for a Medical Work, which he carried in his long hands.

Never mind, you can make one there and distribute it - do just as well.

I found at Ladd's Dr. Fitch's Shoulder braces, & took a pr home to try them - but they are not the kind described in his Lectures. I do not like, and shall return them.\n   Joseph bought his Cactus down here the other day - so I have that for company, when Samuel is gone!

She thought at first it was intentional - that you wished to show her that she had been too familiar with you. We told her you were in a hurry, thinking of other things & forgot it.\n\n   June 5th Mond. P.M. Samuel is going to the City, so I'll send this along, though there does'nt seem to be much in it worth sending. We attend Mr. Tappan's meeting yesterday. I like him very much. I only regret going to meeting here on one account- i.e. getting acquainted with so many people. Perhaps my feelings are wrong about it, and that I ought to sacrifice them, in the hope of doing more good by forming acquaintances and mingling more with others. But I love to stay at home. This ? money and palaver is sickish misery to me.\n            We dined yesterday at Mr. Curtis's - Pretty smart ? of people, I guess. They mentioned divers people, themselves included, who had been waiting for pleasant weather, to call. Also, informed me of Sunday meetings, a Sewing Circle etc. which I should be expected to attend. Any body who will come and live with me, I'll do them all the good I can, but as for going abroad to do good, keeping up conversation, or to \"shine in public life\" any way, I was never made for it. I asked Samuel if I should say for him, \"Been a good boy, and wants to see Grandmother\" - He said \"yes.\" So that's it. I'll send this & let Jos. enclose it in one from himself, which I hope will be more valuable. Do write to us often, my dear Mother and brother Isaac do write.

I began to wonder whether my friends had all forgotten me because I am married! It is five weeks today since I began my sojourn here, and not one word have I heard from our folks at Milo since I left there, except that little note you brought from Albina. What does it mean? I have written the fifth letter to them today! Neither have I had a letter from dear Mother. She wrote to some of the folks as soon as she arrived at Warwick, but Jos. sent it to Milo before I saw it. I was most sick with \"hope deferred\" waiting for your letter, but it came at last.\n You were indeed fortunate about finding your Pocket Book. I should so love to see Northfield. I love to look at beautiful places and things, and I love too, to stay at home - perhaps too well. You inquire if I suffer from solitude these long days. I do not suffer from that cause, and never did. The days are, and seem long, to be sure, & I am very glad to see Samuel when he comes home, but I enjoy myself nicely - am contented and happy. I am sure I would not allow myself to be unhappy from being alone. Did I wish to be unhappy, I would try to find a better reason! I am sorry you have been so hurried in your business. Don't make yourself sick and nervous again, so as to have to take chloroform!

You wish to correspond with me, as a mean of our becoming better acquainted. I shall be glad to as any thing to further our acquaintance and to strengthen the bonds of friendship between us which I feel to be drawing us nearer each other, and as you remark the only means for us to do this is by corresponding. I am but a poor hand to give my views or express my feelings in any way and I think that no one can become very intimately acquainted with me by my writing I have now but little opportunity to write to any & I got to the Mill every morning as soon as I can, usually start at half past six and come home about seven. My work at the mill is not hard, but very tiresome more so than steady employment, however I can afford to have some care and vexation then so long as I can have such a home to come to as I have now. The cares and troubles of my day beset even so thick about me and follow me even so close they must be scattered and droped when I cross the threshhold of home. I ever meet One her - at whose presence is banished every fear and happiness smiles for every joy. I will endeavor to write you again soon and will try to be more interesting, write to us very often.

I have just got done deciding that it is not best for me to go with Ann, though she thinks I had better & ought to. We have some pretty hot weather here now-a-days, though our house is pretty cool, so I don't feel it much. I suppose the Mill folks suffer from heat. Quite a number of the men have been sick. Am afraid Samuel will be - he has so much fatigue and care - he has grown poor a good deal. My health is very good - has not been better for a long time. I think I have just about exercise enough for my health, and the right kind of exercise better than teaching school. I have been quite a hermit this Summer. Jenny has not been with me, nor Mehitable as we expected. We hope she or Olive, or both, will be here now in a few days, though. I enjoy my solitude very much - a great deal better than I thought I should. The first few days I thought I should be tired of it before Fall, but it grows more and more pleasant to me. We do not become much acquainted with our neighbors - live pretty much by ourselves, which suits us both. Abby Thaxter spent about a week last past here - nice little girl - no trouble.

Are you satisfied with the reason? I have had something to do every day, and so have put it off from day to day. Last Wednes. Allura Dorr - who lives in the house with an ornamental \"double & twisted sigma\", as you said Isaac, on the gable ends - came to see me in the morning bringing with her a lady who boards with her. In the two o'clock stage came Lissie Doe with a visitor from Portland - Mary Shirley - and a little boy who is also visiting there. They were hardly seated before Mrs. Thaxter, Ann and Abby came. So you see my little sitting room was quite well filled. The two first visitors departed immediately on the arrival of the last however. We had a nice time. Mrs. Thaxter brought Abby to stay a week if I will keep her, which I am glad to do. Samuel likes to have her stay too - she is still & clever.\n                Ann and Lissie have been teasing me to go to Boston with the, and I have thought some of it. I know I should enjoy it much.

I am all alone - the first time excepting part of a day since a week before I went to Mass. Mehtiable came, you know, before I went away - staid a week after I got back and Mother went home with her, which by the way, was a bad move as it turns out. She heard that Charles was lame & the baby sick, so she was in a quick hurry to get home, but they were both better, and she might have staid and made me a good visit as I expected she would, and then it would have been so nice for her to be here when Anne was fixing away - but we can't help it now. Well after they went home Olive came and spent a week. Then John came & carried her home to get ready to go to Wisconsin, and Anne came and staid most a week after she had closed her school. Almeda has been down too - came & staid two or three days to see Anne & help her. Now Olive has been here more than a week waiting for the man in whose care she goes out. She started this morning. She has a long journey before her, and not a very pleasant season. Am afraid 'twill be stormy a good deal.

in short who is now as ever opposed to everything which is considered sound Whig doctrine and is in the fullest sense a Loeo Foeo?","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95270,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95270","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/0c06af3a0500c92a822a0c752dc6b783.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/0c06af3a0500c92a822a0c752dc6b783.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/0c06af3a0500c92a822a0c752dc6b783.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0c06af3a0500c92a822a0c752dc6b783.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:09:54+00:00","modified":"2020-06-25T03:25:38+00:00","filename":"0c06af3a0500c92a822a0c752dc6b783.jpg","authentication":"a3a5419d78ea95d32d02653d28123858","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_34_012_002_o2.jpg","size":1682206,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2861,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0544424378940280007110885662768851034343242645263671875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["030459"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["030459"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["030459"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0c06af3a0500c92a822a0c752dc6b783.jpg","FileDateTime":1586653462,"FileSize":1682206,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2861\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2861,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 10:23:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:08 03:04:59","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:08 03:04:59","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2895,"ExifImageLength":3642,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1217,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1217","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I do not wonder that Joseph should complain of the difficulty of keeping me Free Soilers with such a Leader.

We rec'd a letter from her at Hartford dated Sept. 27th, and not a word have we heard since. What can be the reason? I cannot think of any evil that can have befallen her except it be sickness, & surely if she were sick, she would get some one to write - but  I can't help worrying. Olive too - we rec'd a letter from her at the same time with Ann, and not a word since. It is hardly time to expect a letter I suppose if she waited till she got to the end of her journey, but she intended to write from Chicago. You inquire whether she has gone? To spend a season with Warren and Theodore - I think it will be very pleasant for her to visit them and certainly it must be so for them to have her stay a while with them. The most I fear is that she will be enticed by some swain or other to take up her abode there - and I think she is too good a girl for that - she deserves to live in New England! You better try to persuade her to come back and be your wife! You ought to have one, and I have no hesitation in recommending her! \n               We rec'd a letter from Warren recently. He seems\n\n[left-hand side]you have heard from them since - Jos. comes down here occasionally- Eliab not often. He is very much confined. Has concluded to leave Brown's this winter I believe - Don't know what he intends to do. Love to all the Uncles, Aunts,  & cousins. Write much & often.

I think he rather likes the change than otherwise, though of course would feel bad at parting with his people. - he has been in Bangor a long time you know  - more than 23 years. He stated that he had been with them 12 hundred sabbaths, and averaged two sermons a sabbath without deducting any for sickness or absence form the country. The statements did not include a considerable number of unwritten sermons of which no record remains. \n     I would send you a paper containing the discourse but perhaps you have already seen it.

Samuel bought a house for 700.00 day before Thanksgiving, a few roads this side of the Bangor House on the opposite side the St. but sold it again in two days for $50. more than he gave. 'Tis a pretty house outside, two story, white, & convenient inside, but built to sell, he thought - Chambers unfinished. II liked the idea of having an \"our house\" much, & felt quite disappointed at first when he sold it, but I conclude he knows best. A house in the Jewett block on Third St. is now hired for our use, but appearances & advices of a later date seem to indicate that it is probably best & that we probably shall spend the Winter in Milo; that is, I myself. I will be there, & our husband will be scaling as he was last winter. His Father & Mother want to go to N.

We like him much, and I believe he is pretty generally liked by the people. I hope they will settle him - don't believe they'll do better. We've scraped? acquaintance. He called here 'tother night. Is acquainted with Ann & Jos.  you know. I like him. Guess he is a whole man as you tell about - Makes good sermons, too. He inquired all about you. Had the impression that you were intending to study for the ministry. John Adams was considered a lutte too big -aristocratic in his own individual feelings particularly! for Hampden folks, I guess. He preaches good sermons though. I'll send Mr. P's sermon - wish I had something else, good or pretty to send you. Mary P. felt bad about going away, but you know her temperament is such that such feelings will soon wear away. I conclude she & Eliab both got sick of each other - but don't know. She always inquired for him & seemed to thank a good deal of him & like to be in his company, but she is rather impulsive & unsteady. Perhaps will make a smart woman. Some natural defects, however. Prof. Shepherd  is engaged to supply the Central church the coming year. Goodrich is dull & sleepy, very, in his manner, not interesting . Snow I do not know. I am sorry you have such an uncomfortable place at \"Grouts\" really. Wish I could do anything for your relief. We rec'd a letter from Olive last eve. She has reached the end of her journey safely & pleasantly. Likes where Warren & Theodore are very much better than Illinois. I am really quite fearful she will be persuaded by some swain or other to live there & not come home. I believe down-east girls are in great demand that way. I don't know if I told you before, but when you can spare time I want you to go to Lowell & see cousin Isaac & his nice little wife. I like her very much. She wants to see you dreffully - says she knows she shall like you for your name, & because you are a Metcalf. I like Isaac too very much - better than I expected from what I remembered of him.

I am at \"Father Furber's\" now. Came here day before yesterday to stay five or six weeks (most of the time) with Mehitable while they are gone to N.H. on a visit. They started yesterday morning. The family consists at present of four persons, to wit: John, who goes to school, and is, I expect, a very fine scholar. Alfred Holman, a very eccentric youth, as you well know, but a good steady fellow, who does the chores & waits upon the women. Mehitable and myself, and our husband when he is at home, which will probably be nearly half the time.  He has not been in to the woods since we came from Bangor till yesterday. Began to feel quite uneasy at being so long (three weeks) without employment. I will extract a few lines from a letter he write to Olive last week. \"I am quite tired of this way of life. I believe there is something morally wrong in a person's feeling when contented in inactivity. Action, properly directed from a right motive is what makes men. There is nothing so dangerous to the well being of society as the means of obtaining a subsistence without action etc.\" I have been at Mother's and Almeda's most all the time since we came from Bangor. Mother seems in very good spirits now. She loves little Charlie dearly, and he is a sweet little fellow with red cheeks & bright blue eyes - noisy as any boy can be","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95280,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95280","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e16e841cff14f77a869eff20737d88b7.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e16e841cff14f77a869eff20737d88b7.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e16e841cff14f77a869eff20737d88b7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e16e841cff14f77a869eff20737d88b7.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:10:08+00:00","modified":"2020-06-25T18:50:03+00:00","filename":"e16e841cff14f77a869eff20737d88b7.jpg","authentication":"9c6ed4a7e6caedcb39e1f9d1d748fb7a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_35_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1683034,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2877,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05416631264563100123243799544070498086512088775634765625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["030632"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["030632"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["030632"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e16e841cff14f77a869eff20737d88b7.jpg","FileDateTime":1586653463,"FileSize":1683034,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2877\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2877,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 10:24:04","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:08 03:06:32","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:08 03:06:32","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2874,"ExifImageLength":3595,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1217,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1217","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"and fat as butter, Laughs out loud most all the time. just begins to go along.

Very much obliged I have been expecting a letter every mail for some time. It was mailed at Grouts, I noted. I understand from Eliab that your station was removed to Northfield again, at which piece of information I did rejoice for your sake. How is it? Was he mistaken? \n                    Josie and Eliab were both here last week. E. spent a week - Jos. came up Sat, and back Monday. Charles and Albina went to Atkinson last week to visit some of her Uncles, but came back without finishing their visit, a Charles Metcalf was quite unwell - teething, which you know usually makes children \"cross\" to say the least. He is better now. I was over there Friday. Mother has been almost sick of a cold, but is better now. Lissie was quite sick a few days, but is well now I believe. She is a sweet child. Perhaps tis because she belongs to our folks, but it seems to me I never such a lovely little thing - so good, and so sensible too. She has been petted enough to spoil a common child. Samuel went into the woods yesterday. John is at school. Mehitable has gone out to the Village, and Alfred is doing the chores, so I am all alone, enjoying myself. I went over home and staid while the boys were there. Eliab is as gay as ever.

He has written to the Hampden P.M. to forward any letters, so if she has wrote since e came from there I shall get it. After waiting a reasonable time, I will write to her again. You inquire what I am reading. Jos. sent me \"Allison's History of Europe\" the other day, from the Mercantile Library, which I read with much pleasure, or should do so, were it not, like all History, filled with accounts of \"wrong and outrage,\" shedding of innocent blood, and all the horrors of anarchy and war. I read last night till I was faint and sick, and had to put the book away - all about the butchery of all the Paris prisoners, and the execution of Louis.  Well - will you tell me what \"house\" is on the English throne now. Have'nt I read something about a contemplated, or wished-for alliance, among some of the royal families, which would bring one of the old houses to the throne again. If so, I have forgotten what. Again, you ask how many people will be benefited by our writer's residence in Milo. I don't know Isaac. I don't feel as though I did much good in the world anywhere. Perhaps I am wrong that I do not mingle more in the society. But I don't love to. Besides most everybody that I used to know here has gone away, and their places are filled by those with whom I am unacquainted. I keep close at home from choice, and have no one to good to but Alfred.  I try to help him when he gets puzzled about his sums.

Whereas he was, in my opinion, good looking before, he is by the same rule, handsome now! I don't know whether 'tis best to hope you will be thrown out of housing, but I want to see you a great deal.\n             Feb. 8th I think on the whole I will forward this by tomorrow mail, and let Samuel write next time. But really I don't know whether to direct to Northfield or Grout's. Suppose however, that you will get it before many days in either case. In the last Farmer, I noticed the marriage of one of your Turner friends I suppose, \"In Turner, Rev. Horatio Merrill of Columbia, Conn. to Miss Sarah Whitman.\" Samuel usually leaves home Monday if pleasant weather, & returns Thurs. or Friday. Once in a while stays at home a week. Will probably be at home every other week now untill spring. Does not have to be away over Sabbath at all. Week before last he travelled 140 miles with his horse, 40 miles on foot, and scaled nine hours. \n          We are going to Dover and Foxcroft on a visit one of these days. Principally to Sewall Cochran's. Sam'l boarded there about a year. I mean to go see Mary Tower too if I can. Charles was there a few days agone to a \"Grand\" S. of T. meeting. There has been a \"Union\" of the \"Daughters\" recently formed in Milo. What think of it? Write again soon, please. Aff.

But what is there about which I can interesting on. I am the greater part of the time in the woods when I find but little to interest me with very much to annoy and perplex. I believe that it is generally said that every one is apt to think their particular occupation afford less than a fair proportion of the privilages and pleasures of life. It appear to me however that the life of a lumberman actually presents but very few attractions for any one who has the least taste for society or domestic life. Perhaps I am mistaken in thinking that I can in no other way so readily or easily obtain the means necessary to live as custom says we must live. If we could loose ourselves from the obligations (I suppose they must be called) which society has thrown about us, how little apparently of the present labor which we have to perform would be necessary to supply all our wants. But I am far from believing that that would be desirable. I rather believe that an active life, active for some worth purpose. It is the mode of life best suited to the happiness of man in all the relations in which he may be placed. \nHow far can we decide our own course in life? We lay plans and build fairy castles and say that we will do this or that thing that we will walk in a broad highway or in some narrow retired path, yet at times how suddenly at time, are all our plans and prospects frustrated.

Samuel brought me over here this afternoon to spend the night and go to meeting tomorrow. Josie is writing to you at home, so Samuel and I will write some too. Your past letter was received in due season. I waited impatiently for its arrival, as I felt in great haste to write to you, on an important subject. Matrimony against matrimony concluded!! I told you in my last of my contemplated visit to Dover & Foxcroft. We went up one afternoon. I spent the next day there, while Samuel went to St. Albans on business, returned the third day. In the morning I went to see Mrs. Hurd - formerly Mrs. Foss, your recollect. She seemed unhappy - and I presume is so, in her present connection - was very glad to see me, spoke of you with much feeling. Afternoon went to our good Mr. Parker's, - who, people say, is liked better and better in Foxcroft - at night, back to Jewett Cochrans, where we spent the night. Well, preliminaries adjusted, was'nt Mary Tower made to be your wife? I did not see her, as I had hoped to do, as she had not closed her school in the Academy for a number of terms, or rather perhaps, a competetor with Sarah B. Carter for that rank.

Our last letter I presume you had not rec'd, when you wrote last, as it was directed to Grout's, came back to Bangor, and was redirected to Goffstown. Had you rec'd it, I doubt not you would have made some reply to mine at least! Jos. is at home here to stay all summer and get well, which we think he has already begun to do. He is a pretty good boy considerin'. How I wish you could have been here a few weeks this spring with him and me. What good time we'd have. He reads and writes a little too much I guess but he begins to go out doors more as the warm weather comes on. Rode horseback up to Boobar brook this morning by way of the Interval. Samuel has got through in the woods, went to Bangor last Monday to find where we are going to live this summer! I expect him home today. We shall probably go to Hampden again however. I do not like to live there very well, but I suppose it is best. Samuel thinks if he does the surveying at the Mill this summer, he can be sure of a chance to survey in Bangor in future, which is what he wants to do. I suppose we shall move from Milo next week, and take Jane with us. She is a very good little girl in the main, (a little too bright sometimes) but is certainly a difficult child to manage & get along with. I think she will make a smart woman, but I feel as if it is a great care and responsibility to take charge of her. I rec'd another letter from Maria a short time since, which I have not got answered, but intend to soon. Guess I must'nt write any more now, but will again soon as we get better, whenever it may be. Write to me then  Aff. Sister Lucy.\n\n[left-hand side] It's nearly three months since we have heard from Ann. Mother, Almeda and I have written since. I think it very strange that if she were sick, some one would have written for her. Possibly a letter has been lost, but we feel quite anxious. Don't you feel glad you have got away from Grout's? That is, if you are not in a worse place now.\n[top] Have we told you that \"Aunt Polly\" has taken a babe six months old for her own? 'Tis one of her sister's Mrs. Philbrook, who died last winter.

From the note enclosed in Joseph's last letter you have learned of my recent visit to Milo etc. I returned last Monday the 16th inst. Mr. Cutts drives the stage this summer, and in consideration of money lent him by Samuel, he lets me ride to Milo whenever I please for nothing, so I intend to avail myself of the opportunity frequently. Eliab and Charkes Dennett came to Milo while I was there, & staid three or four days. By some accident the horse run over Charles and bruised him considerably, but he was well enough to come back with Eliab. Also a naughty cow hooked brother Charles, and broke one of his ribs, so he had to give up work a few days, but not long enough for it to get well. It is getting better now. Moreover a little boy down to the boarding house had his leg broken badly last night in five or six places, by a log rolling on him. Has a pretty bad time with it. I can't help feeling anxious every day about Samuel for fear some accident will befall him at the Mill. But I know it is wrong to trouble myself about it - he is in the hands of One who will do all things well. As for Joseph, our poor dear brother Joseph, I don't know what to say. He was getting along fairly, and we all felt quite encouraged about him, before he came to Hampden and while he was here, but we think he exerted himself to much while here, and got too much fatigued going home.

He says he shall not stay in Milo longer than the first of Sept. Thinks some of going to Waterford but has not decided what to do. I feel somewhat in favor of his going. You know they have been very successful in their treatment of spinal difficultys, and his Paralysis was occasioned by an injury of the spine, you know.

She has not so much strength as she used to have I think taking care of children so much wears upon her, though Charles always seems afraid she will do too much, and Albina is kind & considerate and tries to make everything easy as she can I think.

which means washing day you know- almost dinner time, but as I think it is high time to send you a letter, I will write a little, and get Samuel to finish it while I am getting ready to go to the Village this afternoon. We came from Bangor last Teusday - a week tomo now. I did not receive you letter in season to answer it before we left, and you know how almost impossible it is to write a letter for the first few days after getting home. The mill stopped a little more than a week ago for lack of lumber to saw, and very glad was I, as just about then the Cholera broke out in Bangor, and I wanted to come to Milo - but Samuel will tell you about that. We intended to have our Daguerreotypes taken before we came away. These - just this minute Samuel spirited water through the trumpet on to me and the paper, so you need'nt think the drops are my tears! Well, when we go back, if nothing happens, we will have them, and as you wish I will send one to you.

I thought to answer it sooner, but literally had neither time nor opportunity. Charlie and Willie, (as they decided to call him) had both been quite unwell ever since they had the measles about the time you were there, with bowel complaint. Charlie got better but baby grew worse and worse until his disease terminated in Dropsy on the brain which caused his death. He ? Friday. The poor little fellow suffered a great deal the last few days of his life. He had one fit which lasted nearly three hours, the day before he died, and Fri. night another which lasted two hours or more, and died immediately after his muscles relaxed. Charles and Albina feel very bad indeed, but it would be a great deal harder for all of us to part with little Charlie. He is a dear little fellow- just such a little rogue as one cannot help loveing. Mr. Kittredge last his youngest child (an infant) about a week before baby died. It has been rather sickly in Milo for a short time past - two or three cases of real Cholera - no deaths. People have been excessively frightened here, and well they might be, for almost every case has proved fatal.

And such a roaring where the wind pipes went in each side! I could not help feeling afraid it would blow up all the time I was there. From the ground, where i the mouth of the furnace we went up two flights of stairs to the top of the furnace. There, when it is sufficiently melted down, which they ascertain by measuring with a rod, they put in ten bushels of charcoal lime stone, dross from the furnace, and another kind of stone somewhat resembling lime stone, which is found near the furnace and will answer in part instead of lime stone which they have to bring from Sebec - small quantities of each of these are used. They use about 12 hundred bu. of charcoal & 15 tons of ore, and make 7 or 8 tons of iron per day. They have seven large kilns for burning coal, which hold 50 cords of wood each, and cost from 700 to 1000 dollars apiece. They are built of brick with large wooden pillars and roof outside.

It did look beautifully - illuminating the whole building, which was quite dark before. The iron ore when brought from the mountain is placed in large beds upon dry wood which is set on fire under it, as it all must be burnt over before being put into the furnace. Some beds are three months in burning, though not usually so long.\n\n            In the morning we rode up to the Ore mountain, about a mile - fine timber road all the way - found some fine specimens of petrified leaves, moss, wood etc. etc. saw the mineral springs and drank of the water.

When we came back from the mountain, Col. Cilley from Sebec proposed to give us a sail in an Indian birch - we of course gladly assented. I never was in a birch before - had to sit quite still on some folded blankets on the bottom of the boat. We had a delightful time - across the little pond and the big pond and up the Pleasant river two or three miles, which did bend & wind about so beautifully, forming perfect ox bows, again and again. Fine large old trees on the interval banks, almost meeting over our heads in some place. The birds sung beautifully, it was perfectly still hardly a breath of wind, and we did skim so lightly and swiftly over the water! I did not exactly wish I was a wild Indian, but I did not wonder they loved to \"paddle the light canoe\" across the dark water. And the Loons how they did holler. We saw three of them at some distance in the water and it sounded as if they were laughing at us just as hard as they could.

I did not tell him my fears, but it seems to me he loses strength. He says he has more pain in his leg than he has done, and pain in his arm, hand and fingers.

Our dear brother Joseph, as you doubtless know before this time, has taken the decisive step, and gone to Waterford.\n               I do hope it is best for him,  and try to feel so - but it did seem at first, as though I could not have it so, that he had gone without my seeing him once more. We hoped to get to housekeeping before he came, and have him come and stay a number of days with us before he went farther, but he thought it was getting so late in the season, he had better hurry right on, so he only stopped one night in Bangor, & we did not expect him until the next day. The first I knew of it, Charles came down here, and said he had gone in the Boat that morning. I had not the least idea that he would be able to come from Milo in a day, but Charles said he did not seem very tired. Perhaps on the whole, it was easier for hm than to have been longer on the road. Eliab said he seemed better when he got to Waterford than when he started  - was very seasick & thought that did him good. I fear it was only the effort of fatigue and excitement, but perhaps the journey might actually benefit him.

to Joseph, I suppose I must plead guilty & throw myself on the mercy of the court - still there are palliating circumstances - we expected to move so soon, I thought I would wait so as to tell you the whole story. We have moved (Three weeks since) and do dwell in our own hired house, - The Mill has \"shut down\" - The men (paddies) are all discharged - I have made two carpets, hurried & fitted curtains too numerous to mention, prepared a butter firkin full of mince meat (which you must know is no small job) & with the aid of one Mrs. Finnigan picked & dressed 35 chickens (which are packed in snow for winter's use) besides washing & scrubbing with mop & broom, more than I can tell, and arranging thins which you know have been so long scattered in so many places. It is now 1\/2 past  nine P.M. and really I have not seen a half hour before since we moved when I thought I could consistently write to you. For a few days have had a lame shoulder & side so I could not well write - better now -wrote to Ann & Josie yesterday & today. We have a very convenient & comfortable house, besides being pretty - wish you could drop in & see us now and then - feel more settled than before since we were married.

She is a real good girl, besides being bright as a dollar. I am learning her to write - think I shall not send her to school this winter. I have got her bound, dress, cloak, aprons etc. She is a good help to me just as willing & free to work as busy as I do all day long if I don't attempt to drive, only coax & praise her a little. An excellent girl to obey though. Mother has taught her \"unanswering obedience\" you know. I expect Mother before long. I intend to lay you and Eliab under contribution for a cloak without saying anything to her first. The question is how to furnish her room. Eliab & I have been talking about it - whether her home-made rag carpet ( which she has fixing) her old looking glass, a homemade lounge & some common chairs, or to buy a pretty common carpet, sofa, cane seat chairs etc. We got two good substantial, pretty carpets this fall for $15 and $13, a real pretty French sofa (round ends) for $32. cane seat chairs 1.50 apiece, good one, mirror for $3. A good sofa could be got for 25 or 28 dolls. only not so handsome. Her table would answer very well with a pretty cover, though out of date no matter- she has also a good rocking chair you know. I don't know whether E. had written you about it or not, but thought I would write a bit. Eliab was down here to Thanksgiving. Wish you and Josie were here too. Rec'd a long good letter from Mary Tower recently, at Woburn Mass. attending school.

Presto Change I expect to be \"at home:\" this winter to wait upon my friends, should be most happy to see them all. And how may a man tell all his friends, many who favor us with their friendship do it from a mere love of our fire and table. However it never was my nature to doubt any one's sincerity. I am to apt to beleive all that is told me, and I sometimes think him the happiest man who takes the most charitable view of the world. I think Suspicion cannot take deep root in a warm heart; Are not men's views of the world taken from a consciousness of self? although not aware of it. I will not trouble you with my reflections any further tonight.

I have wanted and wanted to write to you, but of course knew not where to direct a letter until after receiving one from you.\n                  I am sorry to hear of Alfred's \"dejection of spirits\" hope he will soon feel better, and do not doubt he will. I was hoping to see him as he went along. He insists that Joseph is better, so John Furber says, who came down in the stage with him. I have had no letter from Milo since you went away, though I have written again and again. If there is the least hope that the dear brother we love so well is any better I should think they might let us know it. They are decidedly naughty about writing. You speak of my getting the girls \"trained in\" so as to let them keep house while I go to Milo - you don't know how much I want to go to Milo, nor do you know two such girls get along together without a head.

He does not lie down near so much nor so often as when I was there in June, yet his limbs are evidently much weaker. Why is it? He does not use his left hand at all, and cannot take a tumbler or cup from the table without spilling half its contents.

He sits up more (frequently till after dinner) and seems to feel quite as well or better than when you went away, reads a great deal, hears the childrens lessons, plays Back gammon some, But his limbs are still failing he will probably not be able to feed himself but a short time longer he cannot stand at all, in the least he takes his drink through a little tube chooses it rather than have his tumbler put to his mouth,. How calm & patient & happy he is you already know. I feel better about him than I did his life may be long and happier than most others, even if he never recovers the use of his limbs\nThey tell of a case of a Man in Hampden who had not the use of his limbs at all for 20 years & is now a well man.

Our dear Joseph is certainly failing failing. He seems better this morning that is, more comfortable and we hope better. Dr. Kimball is here, and thinks him better than last week. Samuel & I came here last Saturday. That morning Joseph had a very distressed turn coughing - or rather could not cough, nor hardly get his breath. The doctor thinks he has not take cold, though in some respects he appears like it. he has not strength to cough, and it is very difficult for him to raise anything from his lungs. The Dr. spoke quite discouragingly about him - said that he might live two or three weeks or a month, and might be taken suddenly without much warning. Joseph has said many times lately \"I hope Isaac will come\"  - He has not said much about it, but we think he does not expect to live a great while.\n          I asked the Dr. what I should write to you this morning. He said his pulse was decidedly better this morning, and he might live till spring.

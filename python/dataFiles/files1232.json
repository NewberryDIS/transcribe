I am however exceedingly glad to receive mine even as they are, they are an new article in the west. I wonder that our western founderys do not cast them.

I do not know how much longer my school will be, I write very much better than when I left before, still I have some trials,  but perhaps they are no greater than are to be met with  in almost any situation of life.  I believe there is no cup of enjoyment but what has bitter dregs mixed with it at least I have always found it so.  I have an excellent boarding place at Mrs Smiths.  I feel perfectly at home here and I could never be contented where I did not.  I did not go home yesterday afternoon, it rained some and I was very busily engaged mending a green jacket for Mr Smith it was terribly torn and Mary had to hand it over to the old maid!  She thinks it a great wonder that a young  girl like me should like to mend; but I do if I can get something that is badly torn.\nWe received a letter from Warren last week, his family were not very well, he says if I will not go out and","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97387,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97387","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/fdf17ede88889b1b5c60fd6c05968c46.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/fdf17ede88889b1b5c60fd6c05968c46.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/fdf17ede88889b1b5c60fd6c05968c46.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fdf17ede88889b1b5c60fd6c05968c46.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T16:16:12+00:00","modified":"2020-07-01T22:12:27+00:00","filename":"fdf17ede88889b1b5c60fd6c05968c46.jpg","authentication":"e60cf8ca369061bb545e6336f8871f13","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_63_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1535803,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2813,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050552428539453},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["234019"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["234019"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["234019"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"fdf17ede88889b1b5c60fd6c05968c46.jpg","FileDateTime":1587312946,"FileSize":1535803,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2813\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2813,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:19 12:03:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:18 23:40:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:18 23:40:19","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":58,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3010,"ExifImageLength":3852,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1232,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1232","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"spend the summer with him, he will pay my expenses out, what think you of it?

the excitement she has been in ever since she came here seems to have died away and left her low spirited. Her mother and Emily are going to start for the East about the first of September. Mr French has sent for Emily to come and keep house for him, she feels so much for the children that she thinks she must go. Hellen is very much opposed to it. I do not wonder that she wants to go back, but it seems to be taking a great deal of care of? herself -- she has been teaching at the Point? for sometime = Mr. Hall, his wife and Hellen have gone to the Point today and left me to keep house. I wish you could come in and chat with me awhile - it would be much better to have some help than for me to do it all. Mr Hall & his wife are very pleasant people, they have boarded here almost a year. He is from Ipswich ?, she is from New York. He preaches here half the time, has but one sermon - after that a bible class?. We have Episcopall? preaching once in four weeks - the Bishop was here last sabbath - he did not put on his white robe suppose he thought it would not look well in a log house - Mrs Hall's brother was here three or four days a short time since.  Mr Chapin - he is President of Belloit colege in Wisconsin-\nhe is a very pleasant man and a very good speaker-\nOlive was over to meeting last Sunday -Bishop [Hernper?] thought we had quite a family choir - you and Gammy should have been here - but  for your own sakes I am glad that you are not - I can't think that you would be contented - at least here in the farm country.  I dont know how it would suit you at St. Paul or St. Anthony.  St Anthony is said to be a beautiful place and growing fast.\nWell it is pleasant enough here as for that matter but it is not New England.  We were very much surprised a short time since at the appearance of John Tenney  & his wife - they have taken up their abode at St. Anthony for the present.  Our goods have not yet arrived.  We feel somewhat worried about them.  I guess Mother often wishes she was in ? but she does not say much about it, she thinks that after we \nget our house built - she will be contented.

years - the bond to be forfeited, as also all payments made previous provided he does not comply with the terms The reason he assigns is that if he should die before a year that his Estate would be unencumbered by notes - I think his reasons are without good foundation, it is a mere whim, but I see no injury resulting to you provided he gives as he says he will security to pay you $50. or more dollars independent of the amount named in the bond because whatever he pays will be forfeited and you will get that much from the use of the place - if he should neglect or refuse to comply with the

What language shall I use to convey to your minds my own feelings or to assuage the anguish of yours, none, no language is capable, I will therefore not attempt it I must content myself by giving you, a brief history of her brief sickness and triumphant death -- on Saturday morning last (this day week) she complained of being unwell but kept about during most of the day. her complaint was diarrhea on Sunday morning it assumed a more malignant type but not distressing or alarming, Monday morning she grew worse her disease had run into dysentery with frequent discharges of blood we immediately call a Physician who did not consider her case in any way dangerous he tarryd all night and saw the opperation of his medicine Tuesday morning the Doctor left she appeared much better, Wednesday morning found her much prostrated, sent for the Doctor immediately, he then did not consider her very dangerous, she continued to fail however and medicine seemed to have no desirable effect, Wednesday 12 oclock at night Warren went to St. Paul after an experienced Physician returned Wednesday noon. the two Physicians held a consultation administered medicine, she felt relieved Friday morning she was much prostrated and sinking rapidly, all efforts to revive her was unavailing she lingered until 6 \/ oclock this Saturday morning when her freed Spirit winged its way to Realms above

times were of short duration, she was aware almost from the beginning that she should never recover, neither did she seem to be anxious as to die she was perfectly resigned and said she could give them all up (meaning the family) when asked what she wants us to say to you she relied \"tell Sam I can give him up\" her death was not hard she died almost like one going to sleep we hardly knew when

it and protected it from the chill blasts I stand solitary and alone with none to share my sorrows or increase my joys, the world to me is a wilderness\nI must not say to you that Olivia and Metatable are almost women Warren and Theodore are men of strong minds they see the necessity of calmness as on them devolve many duties at this time\nOlivia just informed me that she asked her mother last night what we should say to Sam, said she \"tell him the Lord Jesus Christ\" -- and her voice failed  John is in much distress yet he is more calm than I could expect  The funeral will be tomorrow (Sunday) 2 oclock PM We have sent for the Rev W Neill - Presbyterian a talented man at St. Paul\nI do not for a moment regret having moved her because your mother was anxious to do so that she might as she frequently said die with her children - I do believe that during her short confinement she felt a great consolation in having as many of her children around her she often spoke of you & I think the only thing she regretted was that you were not with her also during the time we have been here her health has been as good as I ever knew it, her appetite has been good it is by no means sickly here except the \"summer complaint\" among children. Olivia's little girl Hellen has been quite sick with the same sickness your mother had but is well  Mrs Harkill has been sick with a slight fever is well\nI know not what I shall do in relation to my business affairs\nI shall take the advise of all my children here - Mahitable feels that she is destitute of a home and will no doubt feel lonely. I shall try and get her a village school, she wishes to teach, I thinkn a change of associations, a change of company and employment will be of advantage to her while at home her mind will be continually upon her loss the sight of your mothers things even will keep her in constant dejection however I cannot yet tell what I may do - I shall come to a conclusion in a few days and will write you next week\nFor much sorrow I unclearmyself you affect. father unclear signature

He says he shall stop with us but another week and I find I must make haste or I shall not have time even to thank Samuel for his gift what I have found time to read is very good - books are highly prized by me and we really need them much more here than we should if we lived where we could hear more lectures and sermons &c I have found a good deal of time the past winter to read and indeed I always take time to read a good deal  I have not access to as many books as I could wish but those who have them are very kind about lending  You were very kind in thinking of the children  I assume ? the children shall feel the benefit of your generosity  I feel very much disappointed that Emily is not coming  I need her assistance, and I long for her society but we must expect disappointments for if we never had them we should forget that \"this world is not our home  Henry & Lucy intend to come next spring but I cannot help fearing they will not accomplish all they wish ere, that is, Father Theodore  Olive and I went to Stillwater last week  spent the night at Mr Boutwell, had a good visit.  We are having 'Oh such a cold spring. how hard it seems always to remember that God doeth all things well, I often feel astonished at my own ingratitude  is it not a crying sin against God?","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97464,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97464","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/21a3794bd6eb202fe2d190afa2ed7cf3.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/21a3794bd6eb202fe2d190afa2ed7cf3.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/21a3794bd6eb202fe2d190afa2ed7cf3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/21a3794bd6eb202fe2d190afa2ed7cf3.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T16:17:55+00:00","modified":"2020-06-30T20:32:06+00:00","filename":"21a3794bd6eb202fe2d190afa2ed7cf3.jpg","authentication":"43983c48f7910f2a7af4defaab0226ea","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_66_003_003_o2.jpg","size":1288442,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2824,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042245108068408},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["235404"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["235404"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["235404"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"21a3794bd6eb202fe2d190afa2ed7cf3.jpg","FileDateTime":1587312950,"FileSize":1288442,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2824\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2824,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:19 12:07:00","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:18 23:54:04","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:18 23:54:04","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3091,"ExifImageLength":3939,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1232,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1232","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Wednesday 8th  I am hoping we shall go to St Anthony tomorrow  I wish you could join us ti's one of the prettiest spots on the globe and now is the time to see it before men have made what they ?an? improvements.

she told me that she thought she might as well die then as any time, that she had lived to see her children grow up - I said but little to her on the subject thinking it might injure her  Thursday morning I went over and remained till all was over - I watched with er the night before she died, who roused up to take medicine or by pain - she always prayed - at first \"Lord have mercy\" and afterwards as her life seemed dragging to a close I noticed that she always associated the name of Jesus with that of God -\u00a0: I saw towards night on Friday that she was failing fast and told Olive if she wished to say anything","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97466,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97466","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/ec03ae329d3e724946cc00a348eda892.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/ec03ae329d3e724946cc00a348eda892.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/ec03ae329d3e724946cc00a348eda892.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ec03ae329d3e724946cc00a348eda892.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T16:17:58+00:00","modified":"2020-06-30T01:08:39+00:00","filename":"ec03ae329d3e724946cc00a348eda892.jpg","authentication":"dfc1b7b2280bffde01745e1c64c67aae","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_66_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1435764,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2649,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050185394907932},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["235426"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["235426"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["235426"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ec03ae329d3e724946cc00a348eda892.jpg","FileDateTime":1587312950,"FileSize":1435764,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2649\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2649,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:19 12:07:06","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:18 23:54:26","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:18 23:54:26","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3138,"ExifImageLength":4263,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1232,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1232","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"to her she must do it soon -

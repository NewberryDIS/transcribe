I am however exceedingly glad to receive mine even as they are, they are an new article in the west. I wonder that our western founderys do not cast them.

I do not know how much longer my school will be, I write very much better than when I left before, still I have some trials,  but perhaps they are no greater than are to be met with  in almost any situation of life.  I believe there is no cup of enjoyment but what has bitter dregs mixed with it at least I have always found it so.  I have an excellent boarding place at Mrs Smiths.  I feel perfectly at home here and I could never be contented where I did not.  I did not go home yesterday afternoon, it rained some and I was very busily engaged mending a green jacket for Mr Smith it was terribly torn and Mary had to hand it over to the old maid!  She thinks it a great wonder that a young  girl like me should like to mend; but I do if I can get something that is badly torn.\nWe received a letter from Warren last week, his family were not very well, he says if I will not go out and","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97387,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97387","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/fdf17ede88889b1b5c60fd6c05968c46.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/fdf17ede88889b1b5c60fd6c05968c46.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/fdf17ede88889b1b5c60fd6c05968c46.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fdf17ede88889b1b5c60fd6c05968c46.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T16:16:12+00:00","modified":"2020-07-01T22:12:27+00:00","filename":"fdf17ede88889b1b5c60fd6c05968c46.jpg","authentication":"e60cf8ca369061bb545e6336f8871f13","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_63_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1535803,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2813,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050552428539453},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["234019"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["234019"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["234019"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"fdf17ede88889b1b5c60fd6c05968c46.jpg","FileDateTime":1587312946,"FileSize":1535803,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2813\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2813,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:19 12:03:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:18 23:40:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:18 23:40:19","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":58,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3010,"ExifImageLength":3852,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1232,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1232","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"spend the summer with him, he will pay my expenses out, what think you of it?

Grove  Oct - Nov 4 1851\nDear Samuel & Lucy\n\nYour kind letter was received week ago last Saturday, also Mother's miniature - we all think it a perfect likeness - you were very good and kind to send it. I am so glad she had me taken - Father started last Friday to go after his goods, I don't know when to look for him because it is uncertain where he will find them he may have to go nearly to Chicago, and he may meet them on the river - we did not dare to wait any longer for fear the Lake would freeze and we should not get them this Fall - they have been a constant source o anxiety to us ever since we have been here - I have looked for them so many times that I almost think sometimes they never will come; but I must learn to wait and be patient - we have felt the need of them very much - Theodore and John have gone up to the Fort today to have an experienced surgeon look at John's arm - I am very fearful he will have a stiff arm - Alfred is to work at Theodore's today and I am left to myself - I have washed, and eaten my solitary dinner and now have nothing better to do than to write to you - how lonesome it looks here - there is no kind smile to greet me when I look up and ask me what I am writing to Samuel but silence and sorrow are my companions - everything looks gloomy - the sky is cloudy, and the wind blows cold and chill rustling the dry leaves about our dwelling - Images of the past come thronging bout me - I see the \"Old house at home\" and with it all the pleasant associations of childhood and youth - I see the happy household band - I hear the kind voice of my Mother  Oh! can it be that voice is hushed forever? But I must drive these thoughts from me - We trust that our Mother is now happy in Heaven, let us strive to walk in the \"straight and narrow path\" looking with an eye of faith to Him who is willing and able to save all who come unto him - then we may hope to meet her there. Oh, what a blissful moment when the friends long severed on earth, shall meet in heaven - I feel that this hope is mine - I trust that through the merits of Him who died to save us, my sins have been forgiven  what a blessed hope that when our earthly pilgrimage is over we shall be received into the presence of God our Savior - Sometimes the thought

We are having 'Oh such a cold spring. how hard it seems always to remember that God doeth all things well, I often feel astonished at my own ingratitude  is it not a crying sin against God?","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97464,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97464","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/21a3794bd6eb202fe2d190afa2ed7cf3.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/21a3794bd6eb202fe2d190afa2ed7cf3.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/21a3794bd6eb202fe2d190afa2ed7cf3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/21a3794bd6eb202fe2d190afa2ed7cf3.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T16:17:55+00:00","modified":"2020-06-30T20:32:06+00:00","filename":"21a3794bd6eb202fe2d190afa2ed7cf3.jpg","authentication":"43983c48f7910f2a7af4defaab0226ea","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_66_003_003_o2.jpg","size":1288442,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2824,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042245108068408},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["235404"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["235404"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["235404"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"21a3794bd6eb202fe2d190afa2ed7cf3.jpg","FileDateTime":1587312950,"FileSize":1288442,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2824\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2824,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:19 12:07:00","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:18 23:54:04","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:18 23:54:04","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3091,"ExifImageLength":3939,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1232,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1232","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Wednesday 8th  I am hoping we shall go to St Anthony tomorrow  I wish you could join us ti's one of the prettiest spots on the globe and now is the time to see it before men have made what they ?an? improvements.

she told me that she thought she might as well die then as any time, that she had lived to see her children grow up - I said but little to her on the subject thinking it might injure her  Thursday morning I went over and remained till all was over - I watched with er the night before she died, who roused up to take medicine or by pain - she always prayed - at first \"Lord have mercy\" and afterwards as her life seemed dragging to a close I noticed that she always associated the name of Jesus with that of God -\u00a0: I saw towards night on Friday that she was failing fast and told Olive if she wished to say anything","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97466,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97466","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/ec03ae329d3e724946cc00a348eda892.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/ec03ae329d3e724946cc00a348eda892.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/ec03ae329d3e724946cc00a348eda892.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ec03ae329d3e724946cc00a348eda892.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T16:17:58+00:00","modified":"2020-06-30T01:08:39+00:00","filename":"ec03ae329d3e724946cc00a348eda892.jpg","authentication":"dfc1b7b2280bffde01745e1c64c67aae","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_66_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1435764,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2649,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050185394907932},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["235426"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["235426"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180618"],"TimeCreated":["235426"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ec03ae329d3e724946cc00a348eda892.jpg","FileDateTime":1587312950,"FileSize":1435764,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2649\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2649,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:19 12:07:06","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:18 23:54:26","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:18 23:54:26","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3138,"ExifImageLength":4263,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1232,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1232","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"to her she must do it soon -

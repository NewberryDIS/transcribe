The whites regarded him as a great chief, but his nation only looked on him as a great orator; he was the speaker of the council, but limited in his influence. His greatest fame among the Cherokees generally was built upon the eloquence with which he reported to them the opinions of others in his speeches, - not upon any great confidence they reposed in his own opinions. Hence he was chosen speaker of the Council, word scratched out an office word scratched out which might be better represented word scratched out to our understanding by the title of the explainer word scratched out for the council. He had long been eminent at the time when Black Fox came into power. His residence was at the foot of Muscle Shoals(?). On the north side of the Tennessee, he had word scratched out considerable sway over the population; but there it was thin and widely scattered.

For some time this continued to engage his attention, until he so improved as to succeed in building a house over a spring for keeping the milk of his mother's cows. Of these, she had a goodly number, and other cattle too, word scratched out and also horses. Of his own accord, George Gist now became a cow milker. To this he was lured by his pride & pleasure in the dairy he had built. He would wash the milk-pails, strain the milk, put it in vessells, and set it away in the dairy. After that, when he grew large enough, he became the herdsman to hunt the colts, from the woods, to look after them, and to keep them supplied with salt to make them gentle -- \n      Here I was obliged to interrupt the story with a question about the salt.

Lowry remarked to Gist, we hear you are getting on with your writings? ___ \"Yes\" replied Gist. \"I am getting on very well; for when I have heard any thing, I can write it down, and lay it by, and take it up again at some future day, & there find all that I have heard exactly as I heard it.\" George","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70116,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70116","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c4a22a523e09ed6b0746af005a6b58db.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/c4a22a523e09ed6b0746af005a6b58db.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/c4a22a523e09ed6b0746af005a6b58db.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c4a22a523e09ed6b0746af005a6b58db.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:14:50+00:00","modified":"2020-07-24T14:53:54+00:00","filename":"c4a22a523e09ed6b0746af005a6b58db.jpg","authentication":"3be2faf017ebbd8c428355349a1d29ec","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL02_00126_o2.jpg","size":372774,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":1507,"compression_ratio":0.045807712158077},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["034431+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["034431+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["034431+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c4a22a523e09ed6b0746af005a6b58db.jpg","FileDateTime":1522422788,"FileSize":372774,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"1507\"","Height":1507,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":1507,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:04:27","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4683},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 03:44:31","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 03:44:31","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":9,"SubSecTimeDigitized":9,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":1507,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1049,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1049","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"129                                                                                      247\n\nGeorge Lowry answered, \"It may be that you are not forgetful.

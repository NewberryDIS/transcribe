I suppose it was mailed Monday morning. Yes we are pretty near together, notwithstanding the 1400 miles or thereabouts separating us. If I remember correctly, my brother Robbie started from Utica, when he came west, at six oclock Monday night, and reached Paola the following Friday evening or afternoon. That was in 1869, thirty-five years ago, and in March, too, if I am not mistaken. I believe it was in March in '55 that Father + family reached Kansas.\nThank you for your words of encouragement. I do not think that I have been particularly discouraged this winter though our affairs have been a good deal tangled,--or at least have been unsettled, so that we have seemed to be held in mid-air. We have an assurance that all things will work together and are working together for our good--and that Providence is working in our lives. I cannot believe it to be otherwise.\nI wrote you in my last that I am now asked to return to the secretaryship of the Union. Of course we feel very grateful that the committee with whom I have worked for two years are inclined to show their confidence in me in this manner; but I think it quite doubtful whether I shall accept the\ntop margin:\nI am not sure but some things in your letter may have required an answer, but as I have it not at hand, I cannot be sure.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":27956,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/27956","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/bcf01f39ec44c677d6b85b4435b84cbb.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/bcf01f39ec44c677d6b85b4435b84cbb.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/bcf01f39ec44c677d6b85b4435b84cbb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/bcf01f39ec44c677d6b85b4435b84cbb.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-07T14:52:26+00:00","modified":"2020-08-09T16:23:07+00:00","filename":"bcf01f39ec44c677d6b85b4435b84cbb.jpg","authentication":"e367529a514abdfde84a80ceca43cdb0","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_13_fl_460_008_02_o2.jpg","size":1397453,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2883,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04488164977325599658275478986979578621685504913330078125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["003603"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["003603"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["003603"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"bcf01f39ec44c677d6b85b4435b84cbb.jpg","FileDateTime":1507387793,"FileSize":1397453,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2883\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2883,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:02 11:57:29","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:07:28 00:36:03","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:07:28 00:36:03","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.64385600000000042797410060302354395389556884765625,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":32,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3165,"ExifImageLength":3952,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":114,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/114","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"work again.\nWe are having another event at our house that slightly disturbs the even tenor of our way.

It looks now as though I would not make my second visit there in less than twenty years after my first visit.\nOur lives are uneventful here, and so I have not much, seemingly, to write about.

One of the reporters left, and he was given a chance to try his hand. He had sought work there a few weeks before and had been told to hand in work on trial whenever he cared to do so, which he had done; so that when the opening came, he already had standing at court. But I do not know whether he will be continued there or not, and, indeed, I fear he will not get much pay for it anyway. He hoped to learn at the end of this past week what he would get, as it was the end of the month. He is quite enthusiastic over it, though I fear that his apprenticeship will have to be rather unrenumerative. Later on, however, if he can stand this unrenumerative period, he might find work in this line very helpful.

JONES, NOTARY PUBLIC\nFOWLER, MEADE CO., KANSAS, Sept 29 1906,\nMy Dear Aunt Mary:--\nI have been rather uncertain, I fear, in my correspondence lately. I have been quite busy for the last two weeks. I guess I have not written to you within that time. Two weeks ago Dr. Thayer, our State H.M. Superintendent visited Ford, and preached on Sunday morning, and went to the country and preached Sunday night. He was to have held a service in Ford again in the evening, but a heavy all night rain prevented it. Peculiar circumstances got me wet to the skin that night on my way from where I ate supper to my boarding place. On my way, I stopped at the church where I had noticed light, though it had been pouring all evening. I found two young ladies--\nsisters--there & their brother. They were waiting for it to stop raining--a hopeless wait, as it proved. Though wet through, I stayed with them an hour and a half, until eleven oclock. Then I prevailed on them to go home.

I have never, you know, had the experience of a broken bone, I have always been pretty careful to keep my bones intact.\nI have been thinking some today, since hearing of your accident, of Grandma's remarkable experiences with her bones. I have an idea that I remember seeing a doctor set a broken arm for her when I was quite a small boy. Then I was with her at a big meeting one rainy, slippery day. I think it was in Morris Roberts church, when she fell and broke a bone. I think an arm. The porch was wet and she slipped on it. Again, remember of her falling in her bedroom and breaking a bone. I think she stumbled on a rug, Then I was with her in the sleigh on the way to church one snowy Sunday morning when she had another accident.

Howard had met an earlier train but before we reached the main part on a street car, he somehow saw us on the car and so we came together. We ate dinner with him and then Helen and I looked around in the stores for the few things we wanted to buy. We ate supper with the Wilcox's and are fixed up for the night in a good hotel. I have come down to the journal office to spend a few minutes with Howard who has had some writing to do and now we are both going back to the hotel for a little visit with his mother. Howard is writing this for me at my dictation and is a very rapid writer\nWe had a pleasant journey. Edward and I enjoyed it very much, but the others got rather tired.\nBryan speaks here tomorrow night, but I fear that we will not be able to remain to hear him.\nHoward sends his love with mine, and will write in a few days.\nMost Affectionately Your Nephew,\nJE.

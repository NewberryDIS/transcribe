Katharine is now staying home attending to her numerous house hold duties. With her getting the meals and sewing the most wonderful clothes for our comming (sic) son & heir she is \"some busy.\" We have just leased a quarter of a floor on Fifth Ave to accommodate the firm know as the KRUEGER MFG. CO., and also the Industrial Novelty Works.  We intend to install two printing presses so that we can do all our own work. Our printing bill for last year was over $3000.00 so you can see that by getting the presses, etc. we will be able to save quite an item. I am a very busy man, just got through serving on the Jury and with getting ready to move and doing my regular work I move around \"right smart.\" and their is only 24 hours in a day. Just received a letter from you to K. I will take it home to her tonight. I wonder if Dr. B. will be the father of his own son?

We are all well hope you are the same  not much change in conditions  Well May I hope that you get a good deal of pleasure out of the set\nWith Love \nMax","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":117885,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/117885","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/095265560a81775369c2704fad903cb0.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/095265560a81775369c2704fad903cb0.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/095265560a81775369c2704fad903cb0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/095265560a81775369c2704fad903cb0.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:09:50+00:00","modified":"2021-03-12T17:44:17+00:00","filename":"095265560a81775369c2704fad903cb0.jpg","authentication":"e2318143d1d91b137d29dea88f1f9337","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_003_fl_086_013_001_o2.jpg","size":1297263,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:2","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2409,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04986174530695078},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["020612-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 3"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["020612-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 3"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["020612-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 3"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"095265560a81775369c2704fad903cb0.jpg","FileDateTime":1612458554,"FileSize":1297263,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2409\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2409,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:26 14:16:48","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.011111111111111112,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 02:06:12","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 02:06:12","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.491853,"ApertureValue":4.33985,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2855,"ExifImageLength":4266,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1380,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1380","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Feb 3 - 35\n\nDear Mary:\nNoticed in your letter to\nMalcolm that Mr Matterson\nmay like to have me drive his\nbus car down to your place.\nThis I of course would be\nvery much pleased to do.

bereavement and sorrow.\nYesterday I went the rounds - called on Mrs [Spink?], Mrs May,\nMrs. McCarthy and at your home.  Like me no one had\nwritten you and no one had a later message\nthan my own sent this morning of June 30 telling of the\npassing out of the precious mother during the night.  we\nall had much the same idea, I found concurring your\nwhereabouts - had presumed that after the funeral\nyou would return to Johnson City with your\nbrother for rest and a visit.  Mrs Spink told one that\nyou might go north to visit Katherine before returning\nfor Arrow Park and Mrs. McCarthy had just got word\nfrom Mrs. Lewiston that you contemplated taking a \nrest at Highlands before going anywhere.  The tiller\nwoman in your home looked bad - said she had been \naway on a visit for nearly two weeks - that she was sick.  She\nseemed sad and heartsick.  The clouds in my own skies\nthicken instead of clearing away as the days go by.  Byrum\nlooks like he had came to the \"Last Grey Home\" and I am\nfeeling that way about him myself.  He is doubtless in the\ngrip of the rick friend of his fathers family and every day\nI find myself more helpless to rescue him from the\nhorrible quicksand in which he is sinking - it is no\nuse burdening you with it though - you doubtless\nhave cares and problems enough of your own to \ndeal with.  We are still at work in the homes - have\nhad a carpenter for more than a week now changing","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":117947,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/117947","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d37cb557b5ceb183ee296fe6f3a68933.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d37cb557b5ceb183ee296fe6f3a68933.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d37cb557b5ceb183ee296fe6f3a68933.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d37cb557b5ceb183ee296fe6f3a68933.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:11:00+00:00","modified":"2021-03-12T05:07:21+00:00","filename":"d37cb557b5ceb183ee296fe6f3a68933.jpg","authentication":"f9e0e9d772ab3093241d64c7fdae2337","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_108_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1782741,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2795,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05905853707016498},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["025726-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["025726-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["025726-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d37cb557b5ceb183ee296fe6f3a68933.jpg","FileDateTime":1612458557,"FileSize":1782741,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2795\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2795,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:10:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.011111111111111112,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 02:57:26","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 02:57:26","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.491853,"ApertureValue":4.33985,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3814,"ExifImageLength":4912,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1380,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1380","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Things for the bath room.

Have just been making out an order 2 wards\nfor a lot of \"every-day\" togging for the household, shoes\noveralls, skirts, underwear & etc.  The contemplation of such a\nlist of things isn't provocative of poetry or thrills by a downsight.\nStill folks who work and sweat and get dirty\nlike we do this humid, hot weather can afford to be\ngrateful for a goodly supply of inexpensive garments\nthat make no protest against lavish applications of soap\nand water.  Though it has been two months or more since\nwe began operations on the home there is very little\nto show for it.  We seem to get more involved in dirt\nand expense every day.  For two weeks now we have\nhad Beelen (?) - he works in brick and concrete - usually under\nDilley.  He has about completed steps at north and south\nentrances and is at work on septic tank.  Francis seems\nto be making a full hand at the work, Byromm busies\nhimself most of the time attending the \"Trans - Florida'\"\ngrow work - it seems unending - now he has started\ntwo men in on the pruning, Johnson charges $9 - per day for\none man and two mules.  I am mighty fearful that \"Trans - Fla\"\nwill mow up \"Paradise\" when they see the figures.\nThe mango crop is waning rapidly now - in a few days\nthey will be gone.  I am glad \"Mother\" enjoyed them\nI think of her so often and wish there was some way\nto be found for reducing that swelling - I am sure","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":117949,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/117949","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/6f31fca0c6b0863034d708673e4f1024.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/6f31fca0c6b0863034d708673e4f1024.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/6f31fca0c6b0863034d708673e4f1024.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6f31fca0c6b0863034d708673e4f1024.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:11:03+00:00","modified":"2021-03-12T18:24:13+00:00","filename":"6f31fca0c6b0863034d708673e4f1024.jpg","authentication":"f92e5785e0acaca549d6bb0873b9664a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_108_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1847393,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2795,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.061200324653813025},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["025744-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["025744-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["025744-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6f31fca0c6b0863034d708673e4f1024.jpg","FileDateTime":1612458557,"FileSize":1847393,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2795\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2795,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:11:05","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.011111111111111112,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 02:57:44","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 02:57:44","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.491853,"ApertureValue":4.33985,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"SubSecTimeOriginal":15,"SubSecTimeDigitized":15,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3814,"ExifImageLength":4912,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1380,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1380","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"that hardy and uncomplaining as she has been she\ncould spend several satisfactory years with us here before\nclosing her eyes on the rings of time if those nerves whom\nbusiness it is to see after feet and legs would only get back on\ntheir job.

She looked as happy\nand talked as unconcernedly about her journey\nas if she were forty.  Mr and Mars Len Eyeh will not go\nnorth until the last days of August.

Neither do I believe all he charges she makes about him. I hear a number of ?letters? quite the opposite.  The only chance for them to get divorced would be for him to ask for desertion which I fancy he could do if she would.  I do not want to have any more to do with it.

                  948 Cowper St.\n                   Palo Alto, Calif.  4\/19\/27\n\nMy Dear Nora -,\n\n Were you in any European nook or cranny, I could in a general way visualize the setting you are in - But try as I will, no picture comes to my mind of \"Nora in Algiers\" -\n\nIt is as nebulous a dream as \"Nora in Heaven\" - Yet I suspect, you feel more \"of the earth, earthy\" there, than any place you have ever abided. All this shows, that after all, much of life is in the mind - Life is big or little, confused or clear, important or unimportant, according to the picture the mind holds. I find that mentally living through my European trip, gives me greater pleasure, than did the reality. And too, I have discovered, that only the people who have travelled the same roads, can appreciate, even understand, what I am patiently trying to tell, for only those who have seen have mental pictures -\n\n How big your world will be when you return to us! For I feel, your ambitions will be satisfied with nothing less, than circumscribing the globe - which once to you was the choicest gift,  Life had to offer!  Now ? it is being accomplished!  \"Nora in Africa\". Really that sounds like a phrase out of a fairy tale - or a wonderful romance! Wonderful! Wonderful!

I am\nleaving the decision to Mother - for these are her years. I am alarmed at the change these seven months in Palo Alto have brought! But she is four score and one years - Perhaps it is just the mark of time, not the climate or even loneliness - It wall makes me very sad.\n\n You too, my dear know the loneliness that consumes me - when the loved ones have passed on - and now your brother has joined the group!

But whether or not we do, Death seems a great  friend to me - To go yang? and quickly is my fervent prayer. It was so, Gus went, so that in Death at least, he was among the fortunate. As I wrote Hattie, I hoped she would not grieve for him - or regret anything. Even if one is so philosophical, I know only too well, the tragic loneliness that descents upon one. And it does not mean? away. Perhaps for the young it may - but not at our age.\n\n I wish I could say something that might make the sorrow easier to hear.

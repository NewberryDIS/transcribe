By 1912 she was singing important roles in Die Walkyrie in German, The Barber of Seville and The Jewels of the Madonna in Italian, and The Tales of Hoffmann in English. A native of Alsace-Lorraine, Dufau had arrived on the Chicago musical scene in 1910 following studies in Berlin, and almost immediately was successful with audiences. After 1916 she concentrated on a concert career, appearing at Ravinia and in Hamilton Park concert series, in Orchestra Hall and in Boston, among other places. In May, 1916, she sang with the silent film The Law Decides, which was one of the latest of entertainments called \u201cCinema Concerts.\u201d In a 1917 recital at Orchestra Hall she sang La Marseillaise as apparently was the custom, followed by \u201can eclectic program\u201d of Russian, Swedish and French songs, along with new songs written for her by Frank LaForge. Dufau\u2019s name no longer appears in the Chicago papers after 1917, so presumably she returned to Europe at the end of the war.<br \/><br \/>This collection consists almost entirely of letters written to Jenny Dufau by an Italian lover named Gaetano Riccuilli from September 1915, to April 1917, while Dufau was performing with the Chicago Grand Opera Company. Most of these letters concern his family or hers, the events of his daily life, the fact of their separation due to the war, and his many moods. Ricciulli apparently was an active service army officer on disability leave at the time of these letters.<br \/><br \/>The principle historical interest of the letters lies in the many passing references to the war, especially to its disruption of civilian life in Italy, and to a lesser degree in France and Switzerland. There are repeated references to censorship, and the development of censorship is traceable by evidence on the envelopes. For a brief time after the start of censorship his letters become more circumspect, but they return to the passionate tone of the earlier ones fairly quickly. One letter speculates on the possibility that America may enter the war on the side of the Italian-French-English alliance. Except in a very general way, there is no information here on the progress of the war itself or of civilian morale, as these topics undoubtedly would have been censored. <a href=\"https:\/\/mms.newberry.org\/xml\/xml_files\/Dufau.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<\/a>\n<p><\/p>","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":41,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/41","name":"Description","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Jenny Dufau letters [in Italian], 1913-1917","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":50,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/50","name":"Title","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Love letters written during World War I from an Italian in Florence, Italy, to French opera singer Jenny Dufau living in Chicago.","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":46,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/46","name":"Relation","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"23","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":55,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/55","name":"Percent Completed","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"023100","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":56,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/56","name":"Weight","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}

I'm now managing the draperies, bedspreads, lamps and china department of Sears Roebuck in Bessemer Ala.  Here I'll stay (probably 1 or 2 years) until I prove myself good enough to get kicked up the executive ladder.  So far there's plenty of hard work but no ulcer, even if I did run the toy department during Christmas.\n   My social life is OK, I read a lot, buy a lot of records, and generally get along O.K.  so I have no complaints.  Except that Uncle Sam is breathing down my neck.  He'd rather I be shooting Viet Cong than paying my $1200.00 in taxes like I did for 1970.  Misplaced values, don't you think?\n     How are things with you and your wife?  How's the book coming along?  Drop me a line and let me know how things are going.\n\nDavid","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":124392,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/124392","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/cab14552d096e68735fa4580e51d99bb.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/cab14552d096e68735fa4580e51d99bb.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/cab14552d096e68735fa4580e51d99bb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cab14552d096e68735fa4580e51d99bb.jpg"},"added":"2023-01-06T21:41:15+00:00","modified":"2023-05-17T04:22:04+00:00","filename":"cab14552d096e68735fa4580e51d99bb.jpg","authentication":"229126409b44043a47590a22f296b7e3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"992006198805867_midwest_ms_conroy_box_00012_fl_00637_000012.jpg","size":264025,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1509,"resolution_y":2000,"compression_ratio":0.0291611442456372882414683544993749819695949554443359375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00012], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00012], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00012], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1437,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1437","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"letterhead  David B.

It was forwarded to me.\n    We see where you and Bontemps have done another book -- the one about the little man who painted the very realistic signs.  Congratulations.  I hope it has the best success imaginable.\n    I'm doing a book now on Vachel Lindsay -- a novel in which he is the central character.  In several weeks I hope to have part of it, at least, ready for submission to publishers.   Pellegrini & Cudahy in Chicago offers a $2,100 Fellowship.  Do you know anything about them?  It's a new publishing house.\n    I had hoped to meet your side-kick Bontemps down at Fisk.  But after leaving St. Louis I went to Springfield, Illinois, to live with my wife and to do Lindsay research.  I was unfortunate enough to catch pneumonia.  Thus Albuquerque.  And I had to forego the Fisk trip as too strenuous in my weakened condition.\n    Do you ever get down this way?  If so, we would certainly enjoy being your hosts.  We'll point out the mountains to you.  Jo, my wife, is thinking of doing a children's book with an Indian theme.  At the moment, however, she is somewhat too busy supporting me to dig in.   There is an Indian and Spanish flavor to this place as you no doubt know.\n   Horace Cayton visited me when he was in Springfield recently.   He seemed like a very nice guy and we liked him.  If you see him, please tell him so.  Also have had some correspondence with John Scoon, Holt's representative in Chicago.  Do you know him?\n   That seems to wind it up for now.  Again, many thanks for your card.

Jack\n\n   Thought you might like to see that your review of Menken's letters ran in the local aftenblatt and where it ran.  Ultra Room is the local version of the pre Castro peep shows in Havana.  Except here you sit alone and look through one way glass at two little broads blowing each other off along with a bit of flogging and other Sado\/Maso crap.\n   Which reminds me...\n          It was said of the Marquis de Sade\n          And he must have found it rather odd\n          That the Baron von Masoch\n          Put him over a hassock\n          And reversed their positions by God.\n   This year we didn't have our usual January in Baja.  At about 03:00 hours on December 17, I was struck by a stroke.  I lay in the dark, felt my left side go numb and cold.  Later saw my  mouth sag and dribble. \n   It scarde [sic] Hell out of me, gave me religion.. Now I am a confirmed Ecopalian.  That's an Episcopalian with the piss scared out of him.\n   But then, things got better fast.  So much so that we spent a week in Santa Barbara between my second brain scan and a consultation with my  internist.\n   I should have held out for Baja.  Even comparing pre-devaluation prices and accomodations, Santa Barbara isn't in it with Mexico.  At that, it was not too bad.\n   What burned me most was not driving my shiny new Alfa Romeo the shole [sic] route.  Leave it to my luck to splurge seven grand on a new car and then get hit with yet another 'stroke' of bad luck.\n    Ah well, at least we're not asshole deep in snow.  I read of 144 inches in Buffalo...that's 12 feet of God Damned snow.  Why can't we ship some of that out to the Sierras to relieve our drought?\n    Who knows?  Any day now there will be a movement of tectonic plates.  The Pacific plate will move away from the North American plate and the whole damn West coast will sink into the Pacific.\n    Since the whole fault line zags way East of LA, San Diego and Baja perhaps, by then, I'll have retired to la Mision and can shrug off the whole cataclysim. [sic]\n    Meanwhile, keep in touch.  Whatever happens, we have little time to keep on exchanging letters.\n\nKeep the faith...if you can ever find out what it is.\nGeorge\nPS Give Gladys two hugs - one from Alice, one from me.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":124420,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/124420","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4494e2277cac4320f6ab3cffe7db4ed0.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4494e2277cac4320f6ab3cffe7db4ed0.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4494e2277cac4320f6ab3cffe7db4ed0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4494e2277cac4320f6ab3cffe7db4ed0.jpg"},"added":"2023-01-06T21:41:32+00:00","modified":"2023-05-19T03:43:12+00:00","filename":"4494e2277cac4320f6ab3cffe7db4ed0.jpg","authentication":"5ca2aa20e71c16906b9818420ef401b3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"992006198805867_midwest_ms_conroy_box_00013_fl_00650_000024.jpg","size":270567,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

pencil in top margin  [1969]\nDear Jack\n\n    First let's stop all the buzz buzz around your office.  Here's what the little dog was doing on the skate board.\n    Then, about a lecture date in the Bay Area.  It occurs to me that Rexroth might be helpful if\/and we can think of some way that this might redound to his glorification.  I shall pursue this.\n   Whatever else, remember that El Rancho 2030 offers you the Three Bs - Bed, Board & Booze.  So whatever else, your trip out here needn't cost you more than transportation.\n   No, we aint got no Albee out here.  We have very little little theater besides having very little theater of any sort.  The performing arts in Frisco tend more to things like bare breasted broads doing the Frug.\n   The Swim is passe  At the 'in' parties you'll see us doing the Drown.  Couples lie on the floor practicing mouth to mouth resuscitation.\n   My good wife commends your solicitude and sends felicitations.  She continues biweekly therapy for the shoulder injured in a cable car last Armistice Day.  The gripman hit the slot brake and she hit the fron [sic] of the car.\n   She sells a painting  now and again but at prices which help the ego more than the exchequer.  Or should I say privy purse since I never know what happens to the money.  \n   We have learned to get along with damm [sic] little cash.  After deductions, our taxable income for 1964 was 2716.91.  The big nut is rent of which we pay none which is a damm good exchange for what little work we do as managers of the building.   Besides this all our utilities are paid and Alice gets a small salary plus a janitorial allowance.  Since this doesn't quite cover our costs, the whole matter comes down to a cash outlay of bewteen [sic] two and five dollars monthly.\n    Since we got the building filled and kept it that way, thus reversing the trend in San Francisco to more vacancies, the owner regards us with deep affection.  This is enhanced by the ways I have shown him for saving money here and in his other buildings.\n    Grateful for neighborly little favors, the tenants blame the owner rather than me when things aren't done quite the way they should be.  Besides, most of the favors (which I would do under any circumstances) are often repaid with a bottle of something or other which is supplemented by bottles from the owner who also owns a wholesale liquor company.\n\nhandwritten in left margin  PS:  I'm always tempted to address  you at Substandard Education Society but know how hard it is to find another sinecure these days.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":124432,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/124432","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7ddbba41c40638a84d62715c00150ba8.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7ddbba41c40638a84d62715c00150ba8.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7ddbba41c40638a84d62715c00150ba8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7ddbba41c40638a84d62715c00150ba8.jpg"},"added":"2023-01-06T21:41:39+00:00","modified":"2023-05-21T04:10:34+00:00","filename":"7ddbba41c40638a84d62715c00150ba8.jpg","authentication":"28c9532bffe552053992f6cfa111976d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"992006198805867_midwest_ms_conroy_box_00013_fl_00651_000047.jpg","size":388151,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1566,"resolution_y":2000,"compression_ratio":0.041310238399318861823861226412191172130405902862548828125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00013], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00013], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00013], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1437,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1437","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Then there is barter.

Thanks for the sentiments-certainly print the poem or letter if you wish, altho I enclose another copy which, I hope, is an improvement.\n     Kenwood is near San Francisco, not Los Angeles.  It is close to Glenn Ellen, former home of Jack London.  I look after a friend's place for my board and a chance to do a little writing, at least theoretically.\n    The Los Angeles and San Francisco John Reed Clubs have joined together to put out a magazine.  We were very favorably impressed with the L.A. delegation, and anticipate success.\n    When I wrote you, the John Reed Club in S.F. was in a bad way, practically extinct.  However, a group got together determinedly and today it is growing by leaps and bounds.  Had the club been functioning as it is now, I should have submitted the poem to it for criticism.\n     We have a headquarters, and the other night, so great was the enthusiasm that is [sic] was necessary to reopen the meeting after it had been adjourned and did not finish the discussion till after one oclock.  Quite a few of our group has real talent.\n\nFraternally,  Jack

(and is teaching in the same Deerifled [sic] grammer [sic] school she attended as a youngster) has an apt. in Evanston, leaving only Naomi, who'll be 18 next month, at home.  . and chances are if we can manage the funds she'll be off to college someplace next year.  I can appreciate what the loss of your daughter must have meant to you, and especially the suffering she went thru, and therefore what you and Gladys went thru'...cause we lost our youngest to cancer in Feb. '73, a week after her 12th birthday, after a leg amputation at the hip.  You learn to live with that, but you never get over it, and the visions of her suffering still haunt.\nAfter having two jobs shot out from under me in one year, I'm now working as a sales rep. for a manufacturer of corrugated box machinery, covering a territory from Winnipeg to Little Rock, Manitowoc to Western Nebraska...so yes, Missouri and Kansas are included.  If I can make it to Moberly on one of my jaunts I'll phone in advance to determine if a visit would be comfortable for you.  And thanks for the Foolkiller; I enjoyed your reminisce of Thomas Benton and Dellinger's piece on H.H. Lewis, who (would you believe!) had escaped me.\nDid you know Vincent Ferrini?  A different kind of poet than Bergman, he hammered  at you with images out of his experiences as a factory worker--vivid, unusual, imaginative with a boldness that sometimes took your breath away--during his proletarian days.  A different kind of tenderness than what I find in Bergman, who is the most poignant poet I can remember.  Hard tenderness.  Does that sound like a contradiction?   Then how about a love poem (WINE OF THE HEART) that ends: \n\n   \"We shall be together so long\n    It will seem like yesterday\n    For the blood of the tenement stopped\n   And ours were the hands removing the blade.\"\n\nOr this one to his son, weeping at a photograph of an Italian lad, blinded and handless from the War, learning to read Braille with his tongue:  (DISCOVERY) concluding like this:\n\n    \"be not bewildered\n     by midnight \n     O child\n     weeping among\n    the weeds\n    look\n    hear\n    the dance of his flute\n\n    his stump is around\n    your shoulders\"\n\nAnyhow, Ferrini has a base in Gloucester, where he lives, and the Univ. of Connecticut in Storrs has just published, in paperback, his selected poems with a magnificent introduction by George Butterick, his editor and friend.  Ferrini and I have been friends for almost 30 years, and in a note, he asks me:  \"Can you give me some addresses for reviewing, magazines and newspapers?  I'll send him poop on the Chicago papers and ask Studs if a review can be gotten into underlined:  Chicago Guide maybe by Studs).\nIs there a chance you could get a review assignment?

And on and on.\nJack's now 77, in exile in Moberly Missouri.  There was a time when he got books to review from the Chicago SUN TIMES and DAILY NEWS, but for reasons I don't understand--cause his mind is alert, his wit sharp, his judgement excellent, and he's a fine book reviewer--they don't ask him anymore.\nIf you don't have, and would like to build a good weekly book review page for your paper, I think Conroy could do a heluva job for you.  What he couldn't or wouldn't want to review personally, he could get fine reviewers for, cause he knows so many crossed out:  people writers.  I don't know what the economics of this are, and maybe this is a foolish dream, but a successful something like this could give your paper a distinction that would make it nationally known, give you fun, a sense of achievement, and give Jack a chance to earn a few bucks doing what comes naturally to him.\nI am taking the liberty of enclosing a recent exchange of correspondence with Jack...and if you think my idea has some merit, write to Jack (or call him ) and sound him out.\nOK?\nMike\nPS?

The hospital guards were even permitting some of the local indigents to escape from the cold and wet of the streets into the somber warmth of the dingy waiting room where some lay stretched out on hard wooden benches, covering themselves with newspapers for blankets.\n\n   My change of shift was 20 minutes off.  I was thumbing a text on the emergency treatment of acute poisoning while intermittently staring through a dirty window at the dirtier street outside, pelted with waves of seemingly endless rain.  Just as I was about to fix my third cup of coffee, he appeared at the door.\n   He was black, middle-aged, drenched to the skin and shivering.  Also he was blind.  You have to understand I have this thing about blindness.  A friend of mine studying to be a psychiatrist once told me it was an upward displacement of an unresolved castration complex.  Well, maybe.  Anyhow, my feelings about the blind have always been gut-strong.  His was a familiar story.  He was on welfare, living alone in a basement apartment.  Borderline nutrition and the dampness of his flat led from a simple cold to a persistent cough with chills and fever.  He couldn't afford public transportation.  He walked to the hospital for help.  By the time he arrived, he was so wet you couldn't tell the color of his clothes.\n   Fortunately, my examination revealed nothing beyond a severe upper respiratory infection.  Certainly no pneumonia; early bronchitis at worst.  I dressed  him in hospital garb, putting his wet clothes to dry on the radiator, gave him a cup of hot coffee, and wrote two prescriptions, one for an antibiotic, the other for cough syrup.  I really wanted to hospitalize him, but he wasn't that sick, and I would have been severely criticized for unnecessarily utilizing a bed.  The pharmacy was due to close shortly and I didn't want him to get lost getting there, so I decided to walk over with him.\n   The pharmacy was closed when we arrived, the service window shut, and the over-varnished door locked.   I rang the emergency bell.  No answer.  I rang again.  Still no answer.  I rang once more, this time insistently.  The door opened and I was confronted by an elderly man.\n   He was shorter than I, and what little hair he had was gray and disheveled.  He badly needed a shave.  He wore a short dirty hospital coat with the sleeves rolled up.  It was wrinkled and stained and missing one or two buttons.  In is right hand he held a piece of fried chicken, a bite of which he was still chewing.\n   \"Well,\" he snapped, \"what do you want?\"\n   \"I have a patient here with a bad respiratory infection.  He needs two prescriptions filled.\"\n   \"The pharmacy is closed,\" he replied.  \"He can get them filled elsewhere or come back in the morning.\"  He started to close the door.\n   \"But he hasn't got the money to pay for them privately, and besides he's blind, and it's difficult for him to travel.\"\n   \"I told you we're closed.  I've worked all day and now I'm finished.\"\n   At this, he turned and walked toward the back of the pharmacy.  I followed him through the door between shelves of bottles and jars into a room heavy with pungent medical odors.  \"Look, I'm sorry to be late.\"  I was begging by now.  \"And I'm also sorry I interrupted your dinner, but this poor man could really use the medicine today.  It would be a mitzva if you could take a few minutes to fill the prescriptions.\"  I hardly expected the vigor of his response.\n   \"Mitzva!\" he exploded.  \"You speak to me of good deeds!  What do you call working in this crummy place day after day, having to spill out the rest of my life serving endless lines of miserable people, if not a good deed?  Isn't that enough?  Can't I even have my peace at the end of the day?  You can feel sorry if you want.  I stopped feeling sorry long ago.  I tried it and it doesn't change a thing.  Do you think I was always employed in a place like this?  Before the Depression, I used to have a store of my own.  A fancy place in a good neighborhood...but the competition of the big chains was finally just too much.  I lost everything, and here I am, in the back of a crummy county hospital pharmacy, eating a chicken dinner out of a greasy paper bag.  So don't talk to me about good deeds.\"\n    We found ourselves quietly looking at each other.  He had been gesticulating wildly in the air with the chicken, but his right arm now hung limp at his side.  After a few minutes of silence, I turned to leave.  I was almost to the door when I heard him mumble.\n   \"Oh, what the hell, give me the prescriptions.\"\n   It didn't take long to prepare the medication.  I tried to thank him as he handed them to me.\n   \"Forget your thanks,\" he said.  \"Just leave quickly, so I can finish and read my newspaper.\"\n   It was still raining we walked back to the emergency room.  It was also dark outside, and the unshielded light fixtures in the high ceilings cast a naked glare on the cold, cracked walls of the hollow corridors.  I was caught somewhere between that bitter disillusioned man's loneliness and the ever renewing excitements of my young enthusiasm.  The blind man was also in there someplace.  In fact, as we walked silently along, with his arm gripping mine for guidance, I had difficulty telling where his hand ended and my arm began.  It suddenly seemed to me as though I would never be wholly rid of him, and I felt strangely as if I were my own father.\n\nitalics  Irwin M.

She had many bumps, but no bones broken, she always faints at at blood, she weighs about [blank] Dr. Wenochler says he had a hard time to get her up the stairs.  her poor Mother almost fainted, she was so frightened, she had been sick herself for a few days, and she had buried her Father only a few days before, so she was very nervous, and had been just vaccinated a few minutes before.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":76032,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/76032","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/9b690e5cccd30620871ea819503980e5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/9b690e5cccd30620871ea819503980e5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/9b690e5cccd30620871ea819503980e5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9b690e5cccd30620871ea819503980e5.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-11T20:23:54+00:00","modified":"2020-03-25T19:06:32+00:00","filename":"9b690e5cccd30620871ea819503980e5.jpg","authentication":"5acffb1b04a150e465983068c1faf411","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":45,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03c_048_o2.jpg","size":1081021,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2270,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044094509707946},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180108"],"TimeCreated":["103453"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180108"],"TimeCreated":["103453"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180108"],"TimeCreated":["103453"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"9b690e5cccd30620871ea819503980e5.jpg","FileDateTime":1531340572,"FileSize":1081021,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2270\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2270,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:11 15:02:02","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:08 10:34:53","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:08 10:34:53","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":87,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1724,"ExifImageLength":2733,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803254,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1093,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1093","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Scarlet fever so bad in Lake Forest, all schools and churches closed, talk of quarantine the village.

It will be a great disappointment to all the children, as we have always celebrated.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":76336,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/76336","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3f572b3d7e885d223711130667ebc8fe.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3f572b3d7e885d223711130667ebc8fe.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3f572b3d7e885d223711130667ebc8fe.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3f572b3d7e885d223711130667ebc8fe.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-11T20:29:30+00:00","modified":"2020-04-14T16:21:29+00:00","filename":"3f572b3d7e885d223711130667ebc8fe.jpg","authentication":"7434e65f495f917a3934bf83996c27eb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":349,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03c_352_o2.jpg","size":1263259,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2479,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047183713564311},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180108"],"TimeCreated":["111157"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180108"],"TimeCreated":["111157"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180108"],"TimeCreated":["111157"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3f572b3d7e885d223711130667ebc8fe.jpg","FileDateTime":1531340586,"FileSize":1263259,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2479\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2479,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:11 15:10:12","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:08 11:11:57","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:08 11:11:57","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1844,"ExifImageLength":2677,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803254,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1093,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1093","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Red brocatelle satin furniture came home today- all recovered- looks handsome.\nSaturday, Dec. 12, 1903\nIt is stormy today, we thought Mr. A.

One never to be forgotten in Chicago, as the morning news tells of the list of the dead and injured at the burning of the Theatre Iriquois new building. It is an awful calamity, sending horror to so many families. There is a pall thrown over so many households, all the parties have been recalled. So many have lost families and friends, the Mayor has said there was to be no demonstration on account of the calamity. White writing, the city bells are ringing & whistles and gun firing, to enter in the New Year.\nAt three o'clock, the Expressman called for our four trunks, and the carriage was at the door, and we said \"Good bye\" and went to the Kenilworth depot.

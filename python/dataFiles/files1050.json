The proceedings of the Delegation were all read & explained to the people unreservedly & in the open air. Currey was an attentive observer & listener; but he spoke to no one, and no one spoke to him: a studied silence was preserved, because the Indians did not regard him as one with whom they could, with propriety & safety, communicate.

Mr Ross intimated that Major Currey had given notice of a meeting near Ridge's on the 20th of July for the purpose of disposing of the annuity money; but he doubted whether that spot was one upon which Mr Schermerhorn would be likely to gain his object.  If, however, it were agreed upon to change the meeting place strike out: should be thought to to strikeout: Ridge's the Agency, or Red Clay, Mr Ross would personally invite all the Leading Men & People to attend, & he was persuaded Mr. Schermerhorn would then have the strikeout: all opportunity he strikeout: desired so much wished for. Mr Schermerhorn replied that over that subject he had no control.  \"As the Highest Officer of the United States now in strikeout: the our country,\" answered Mr Ross, \"surely none could interpose so fitly; especially as the people meet only strikeout: 2 words as the Agent professes, to receive their strikeout installments of pay for strikeout the land they have parted with; and for such a meeting, surely no convenience but theirs ought to be consulted.\" Mr Schermerhorn said","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70201,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70201","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4cbd7c1e515af92b65eeff05a74c6de4.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4cbd7c1e515af92b65eeff05a74c6de4.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4cbd7c1e515af92b65eeff05a74c6de4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4cbd7c1e515af92b65eeff05a74c6de4.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:18:56+00:00","modified":"2020-08-03T11:57:47+00:00","filename":"4cbd7c1e515af92b65eeff05a74c6de4.jpg","authentication":"4e1e5ef3b24eb8a5dd89520e0f656dac","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":59,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL02_00210_o2.jpg","size":414351,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":1568,"compression_ratio":0.04893601190476200291090691507633891887962818145751953125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["043315+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["043315+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000116"],"TimeCreated":["043315+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000116"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4cbd7c1e515af92b65eeff05a74c6de4.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423081,"FileSize":414351,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"1568\"","Height":1568,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":1568,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:05:34","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4585},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:16 04:33:15","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:16 04:33:15","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":16,"SubSecTimeDigitized":16,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":1568,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1050,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1050","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"said he would confer with Major Currey.

You will know from the smallness of the number of those who attended your first notice on this subject, that the Cherokee are not disposed to meet at this place you have designated.

I should advise you & your friends to attend this Council, & if there is not a general attendance, I assure you I will use all my influence with the Agent & the approving party to postpone it to another time, as I perceive from the instructions from the Indian Department that a majority of those  who attend the Council, have the power to controul the disposition of the annuity.  I should deem myself extremely fortunate, if I could in any way be the means of bringing together , & to a right understanding, all your people; so that they might act all in harmony & concert, in bringing to a general close by a treaty, the unhappy difficulties existing between your people & the government of the United States.  With respect  Your obedient servant, J.F. Schermerhorn,  Commissioner.  Mr John  Ross, P.C.C.C.N.  Expressions in the foregoing letter, render it perfectly obvious that, under any circumstance, a full attendance of the people was neither expected nor desired by the Agents.  It is equally obvious that they knew Mr Ross had made no other preparations; & there now remained only strikeout: eleven ten days to the meeting.  The time selected was one when it was peculiarly inconvenient for the people to leave their farms.  It was a moment when they were intently occupied in ploughing the weeds & working over the corn.

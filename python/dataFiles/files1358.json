uncertain tenure of all mundain things, the author has employed himself for some years in getting together authentic data, connected with the Ethnology of the American Indians, and making drawings of the specimens in his own collection, and those of his friends, and acquaintances possessed of reliable specimens, in order to perpetuate, and hand down to posterity a true portrait of the indian of today, at least as much of the native indian as at present exists.

Some writers have held that the indian has a common origin, and the different natives are but ramifications of the parent stock, how far that may be true it is impossible now to determine. The indian is preeminently wild and in that condition he has wandered over this continent for no one knows how long. Columbus in 1492, in his search for a western passage to India, found land and natives on it, of a red color, and supposing he had reached his ultimatum named these peoples, \"Indians\", from which circumstance all the native people of the American continent are today known as \"Indians\", be they descendant of the ancient \"Toltec\", \"Aztec\", Chinese or Japanese races. The best evidence that can today be obtained seems to point to the former existance of at least four parent stocks from which have sprung the present races and tribes. Two probably from the east, and two from the west. In those of eastern origin, we are now most interested, and will consider them together as the Dakota, or Sioux and Ojibway (or Chippeway) of today.

They are the same \nas the Algic race of ancient day, and the Algonquin of more recent date.\nIn all indian nations the division into tribes, and the selection by the offshoot\nof a new place of residence, in the course of generations gives origin to a new name\nfor this dismembered branch, which in time becomes the cognomen of a new tribe.

Apart from\nthis fact it seems likely, if not positively proven that the Algic or Ojibway indians\nare of eastern origin, and what evidence we have on the question of the Dakota tribes\nindicates they are of crossed out - like a similar origin However interesting this line of research\nis we must refrain from going too deeply into it as this much has to do rather\nwith the ethnology of the indian of today than their history, albeit enough must\nbe narrated to indicate crossed out - the lines of research. so that the reader can intelligently\nfollow the theme.\nThe name Ojibway has by the various writers been variously discussed and commen-\nted upon. they all agree that \"Ojib\" means bunched or puckered, and some alleged\nthat \"way\" means fire, hence the origin of the name is \"puckered with fire.\"This\nis derived from the fact that this race of indians unlike the Dakotas and other neighbor-\n-ing nations were in the habit of roasting their captives, till as they express it they \nwere puckered up or bunched up with fire.    Another writer states that they are called \nOjibway because they make a moccasin puckered up on the instep. It would\nseem however that the most true and plausible derivation of the word is that given\nthe author by crossed out - my his interpreter at Loc des Flambeau, and from his that explanation we\nmakes it  those of the \"Bunched Voice.\" \"Ojib\" it is conceded means\nbunched and it \"way\" is unquestionably \"voice\" or speech and this  explanation\nfits exactly the facts of the case for the Ojibway in speaking will generally only\nutter a single syllable of a word which to them means an entire word and a \nfew syllables express a sentence, hence their voice may be very Justly

The Indians believe that they are turned into Buffalo and other animals.\nThe ancient Irish crossed out - did held the same belief except as to buffalo. Spencer maintains this\nthe Irish view of Scythian origin, and if so it is easy to ascribe without any\ndeparture from probability [truth the] a like origin to the indians, at least the Ojibway or\nAlgic branch. Women among the Irish had the care of all thing in the home\nand field. This is a Spanish as well as an Indian custom. The Gauls used to \ndrink the blood of their enemies and paint themselves. The Ancient Irish practiced\nlike customs. The Ojibway as late as the early part of this century revelled in the\nblood of their enemies. On one occasion at Fort Snelling  Minnesota The Ojibway were\npermitted to punish by death in their own way three Dakota murderers. As they\nwere being led out to be shot, two sang their death song with a brave heart which \nthe third could not sing through fear and trembling. They were all given thirty \nrods and then started to run, but were all shot.

the hand in a white pigment, and applying it to the body. the result of this \nadornment was truly hideous but the specimen as a man, was noble. In the south \nthe Dakotas encounter more of the hard thorny shrubs consequently they use the \nleather, or skin leggins, more than do the northern tribes. The Yankton Dakota, is a good \nspecimen of the southern indians.  He carried the Winchester rifle, and belt of cartridges \nspace left for inserting a drawing   Yankton Dakota cut\nin other respects the dress is that of the wild indian. \nThe arms and upper part of the trunk are nude \nthe belt, apron and leggins cover the rest of \nthe body and over his shoulder is thrown a blanket \nin which to wrap himself at night or when cold. The \nhead dress of this man shows a peculiarity of the Dakotas, which is that they seldom \ncarry two war eagles feathers erect. one is always, if ever at all erect. the other is \nloosely attached. It has been said that the war eagles feather was worn to denote \nthe number of scalps taken by the wearer. This is not however exactly correct. The war\neagles feather denotes a chief. to be a chief necessitates the taking of a scalp, and the \nendurance of great suffering and torture. These feathers are expensive, and few indians \neven though they may have taken a number of scalps, could afford to wear one for each scalp. The \nfamous chief \"Slotted tail\" is reputed to have killed (539) five hundred and thirty nine \nindians and whites, [crossed out: and] he could hardly find room on his head for so many eagle feathers. \n\"Gall,\" a noted chief wore but one. the same is true of the late Sitting Bull He carried \nusually one feather sometimes two. Of the chiefs and others engaged in the outbreak at \nWounded Knee S. Dakota in 1890. Kicking Bear, the chief, and all the others carried but one erect \nfeather.\n[[crossed out:  The adornment upon the person of these indians is about as meager as it is common \nto see them. they are usually decked out in plenty of indian finery, but it is easy to explain \nthe poverty of their means.

The war, or dance dress Knife a Fort Yates Dakota crossed out:   is a splendid example of the manner of getting ready for war or the dance  \nspace left for insertion of drawing\n\"Knife\" cut\n\nWhen we use this term - war and dance, it must be remarked that to the indian mind they are almost synonymous. In the dance, as in war, the indian works himself up into a state of frenzy, and in that state is in the full enjoyment of exhilaration. They are therefore each equally important to the happiness of an indian. Knife's costume is a typical one and represents that worn by all Dakotas, with of course modifications. Upon his head is the war bonnet. this is made of the skin of an animal or a piece of cloth usually however, the skin is used, and the form of it is a skull cap closely fitting the head with a long tail behind, and a greater or less number of feathers and skins hanging from the sides. about the neck is a bit of gay colored silk, and the long deer toe, or plumb stone necklace. about his loins is a belt ornamented with brass disks and a band of otter fur from which are fastened strips of leather strung with sleigh bells. The right arm is decorated with an armlet of beads and a bracelet of metal. and the right hand grasps the war club. In the left hand he carrires the sacred medicine pouch or bag. Each Dakota indian, when he reaches that time in his life when he emerges from youth to manhood, feels it incumbent upon him to become a brave and to do this he must fast, for a number of days, and retire to a lonely spot and fall into a trance, in which state the Great Spirit reveals to him what his especial medicine is to be and also his guardian animal and upon awakening he must procure the medicine and kill and present the skin of the animal, bird or fish, as the case may be, and always carry the medicine in the pouch. This medicine is not as the white man views it a medicine - this term to the indian is mystic and the medicine acts by being held in possession, for it is often the tooth or claw of a bear, or a bone. at other times a piece of glass, or a fragment of rock. The writer in excavating this mound of an (Adagameo?) indian found a nugget of native copper, which was wrapped in buckskin and birch bark, and was the medicine of the unfortunate indian in whose ruined (home?) his bones were found.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114776,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114776","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c6da1ae6ad3e2bd27b0639750b2a35c0.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c6da1ae6ad3e2bd27b0639750b2a35c0.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c6da1ae6ad3e2bd27b0639750b2a35c0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c6da1ae6ad3e2bd27b0639750b2a35c0.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:15:40+00:00","modified":"2021-06-22T01:22:45+00:00","filename":"c6da1ae6ad3e2bd27b0639750b2a35c0.jpg","authentication":"492ed95bba90a14d396be1f33e0a511a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00034_o2.jpg","size":942010,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2748,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.03174059248476999994803549043353996239602565765380859375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["121121"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["121121"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["121121"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["121121"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["121121"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["121121"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c6da1ae6ad3e2bd27b0639750b2a35c0.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324487,"FileSize":942010,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2748\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2748,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:31:45","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 12:11:21","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 12:11:21","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":85,"SubSecTimeDigitized":85,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"23\nThis medicine pouch carried by Knife is an otter skin.

The men hunt, smoke, attend councils, and go to war when they are not eating or sleeping, all the other duties are attended only by the women. His hair is combed and greized, and then plaited for him by his helpmate, and it is not at all surprising that this indian should prefer that state of things to continue rather than to adopt the role of the white men, and go to work in the field as a laborer. He will have to come to it but it is hard, and a bitter pill. The hunter returned from the chase throws his quarry at the door of his teepee, or wigwam, and the squaw then takes charge of it. his duty is ended. The indians of both these nations are disposed to be affectionate to their children, and the father will avenge the death of a child or an injury done them to the bitter end, and this thirst for vengeance never dies till it is satiated by the blood of an enemy. It is not always necessary that the slayer of the son or daughter shall suffer; but it must be one of the opposite nation. as of old the cry is \"blood for blood.\" An old Ojibway having lost a son by the hands of the Dakotas carried about with him an article worn by the dead, and when he had dipped it in the blood of his enemy: a Dakota the \"Mane\" or spirit of the child was appeased. The indian is stoical, and will never in the presence of anyone show his grief. tears are seldom shed. but an indian man will show his greatest grief by the most eloquent harangue or speech or in mute silence. The women however are noisy in their lament. The affairs of public interest are never acted upon hastily, nor will a chief assume the responsibility of an action, however trifling, without consulting with others.

They were then scattered about in the \"Sugar Bush\" camps.     \"Nawa gulb\"   \"Midday or something that occurred at noon\" - the Third Chief happened to be nearest the Station and he was visited first.

An instance is on record when a\nfather followed and waited for four years before he got a chance to avenge the death of his son.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114779,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114779","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/6dec7e56ba37626941894ff783306768.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/6dec7e56ba37626941894ff783306768.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/6dec7e56ba37626941894ff783306768.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6dec7e56ba37626941894ff783306768.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:15:44+00:00","modified":"2021-06-22T01:53:59+00:00","filename":"6dec7e56ba37626941894ff783306768.jpg","authentication":"69ea8179410c460e4d5f194c42322d60","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00037_o2.jpg","size":1217185,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2737,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04117731633716299743941391398038831539452075958251953125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["121150"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["121150"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["121150"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["121150"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["121150"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["121150"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6dec7e56ba37626941894ff783306768.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324487,"FileSize":1217185,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2737\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2737,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:31:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 12:11:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 12:11:50","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":74,"SubSecTimeDigitized":74,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"26\nThe character of the indian is by no means that to be accepted or a pattern in\nall particulars.

On this suit are five hundred and thirty nine 539 scalp locks which are supposed to represent as many indians killed by the wearer. The shirt is made of two antelope skins dress in the usual fashion. These are sewed together along the top edge leaving a hole for the head to pass through, and to the sides are sewed sleeves made of buckskin. At the lower edge of the shirt is cut in tabs, and the hair left on it to make a fringe. the short tail of the animal is also partially left as an ornament. The long tails, or tabs at the sides, are the parts of the skin of the antelope which covered the flanks and legs. The indians are not given to studying fashion plates, so they just take the articles as they come most readily to hand, and use them up. Covering the shoulders and passing down in front and behind are strips of buckskin. elaborately ornamented with woven? porcupine quills. These stripes are a trifle wider on the shirt than on the sleeve. they are wrought in blue, red, yellow, green, carmine and white quills. White ones predominate, and the figures are of the same colors. about the edges of these stripes are rows of beads in green, blue, red & yellow color. The same colors prevail on the sleeves as on the shoulder stripe. On the breast and back is a tab of buckskin ornamented with a fringe of the same and blue and yellow quills. On the shoulder strips and sleeve the quills are sewn? in a diagonal and are so ingeniously arranged that the colors of certain diagonals are alternated while others are uniform in color. At the edge of the sleeve is a narrow edge of beads of torquois blue, Prussian blue and yellow. Upon the upper half of the shirt, are drawn in color: brown for the stems and red for the ? a number of calumets, two on each side of the tab, in front and behind, with four below it and four more are found outside of the shoulder strips, front and back.

He was a desperate warrior and in a spasm of jealousy, shot the \nchief Big Mouth at the door of his teepee. He was adicted as the scalp lock on his\nsuit show, to war also, and seldom returned lootless from an expedition. His clear head \nand sound Judgment procured for him great reputation not only among the Dakotas but\nother indians and especially with the white men. He was selected to treat with them on\nthe part of the indians and not infrequently he was chosen by the whites to intercede\nwith the indians. His high position naturally gained for him many enemies, and his quarrels\nwere numerous, no indian no matter how exalted he may be is safe. His path is beset with\ndangers, and the other chiefs are suspicious and Jealous. To kill a chief in a quarrel or feud was a\nlaudable ambition. and Spotted Tail met his death on the 6th of August 1887 near the Rosebud\nagency in S. Dakota. He had long had a running feud with \"Crow Dog\". and on that date \nand place, he met his enemy who crossed out - shot him suddenly drawing a pistol shot\nhim, unawares. \nThe late chief of the Dakotas, \"Sitting Bull\" of the \"huca papa,\" tribe was a strong\nman intellectually, but unlike \"Spotted Tail\" he was unfriendly to the whites, and although \na captive, continually incited the Dakotas to attacks upon the whites, and neighboring\nbands. In 1872 he endeavored to join forces with \"Chief Joseph\", of the \"Nez Perce\" and was captured\nin his efforts to cross the Canadian border. In 1890 he was shot at his camp\nnear Pine Ridge, S. Dakota, in a skirmish as is alleged between the hostile Dakotas, and\nthe Mounted Police of the United States. It is not positively known whether the fatal shot was\nfired by the Police or by his own people in their efforts to rescue him from arrest.\nWith his death the leadership of the Dakota bands fell to \"Kicking Bear.\"\nwho was also a captive and prisoner of war. To convince this chief of the vanity of an attempt \non the part of the indian to conquer the white man. He was sent with other indians to \nEurope with \"Buffalo Bill,\" \"William Cody, Esq.\" and upon his return to Fort Sheridan,\nIllinois the only relic of his indian \"outfit\" was his \"horn disk\" of which we give a \ndescription in Chapter IV.

women: Ojibway.\nThe hair of an indian like that of the civilized man and woman more especially the women is the means by which to apply to his or her person the various articles of adornment. The ?means? of dressing it is as a rule characteristic of the tribe. The Dakota combs the hair back over the back and sides of the head, and wears usually a plait at each side of the head, wrapped with fur and tied on the ends with beads, ribbon or feathers; on the crown of the head he will sometimes wear a ?roach? as \"Lone Wolfe\" shows it - or the hair is parted in the middle. The forehead is adorned with numerous smaller braids of hair hanging over the eyes or about the temples. these are adorned with beads or bits of brass rings or tin bent round the braid. It makes little difference to the indian what the intrinsic value of the article may be he is content to wear any ornament that has a light and attractive appearance a bit of tin or brass has the same value in his eyes as it would have if it were gold or silver. A silver dollar has greater value with the indian not because it weighs more than a half or quarter of a dollar, but because it is larger and more shiny. The squaws as a rule among the Dakotas as well as the Ojibway wear the hair plain, simply braided in two large plaits on either side of the head, or one long one hanging down the back, and they seldom wear ornaments in the hair.

This specimen is from the Lower Brule Agency as is also the comb. and is twelve inches long about half the length is handle and is wrapped with red, green and white quills and to the end is attached a tassle consisting of two strands of buckskin wrapped with porcupine quills.  red. and green. terminating in tin cones with green horsehair.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114797,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114797","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/2ad493a882eabef3a4223c58fa72763a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/2ad493a882eabef3a4223c58fa72763a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/2ad493a882eabef3a4223c58fa72763a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2ad493a882eabef3a4223c58fa72763a.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:16:07+00:00","modified":"2021-06-26T15:37:36+00:00","filename":"2ad493a882eabef3a4223c58fa72763a.jpg","authentication":"3a420dbee1167aaea35f6ef1d0345c81","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00058_o2.jpg","size":969445,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2711,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.033110817383226000265583621740006492473185062408447265625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["121904"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["121904"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["121904"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["121904"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["121904"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["121904"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"2ad493a882eabef3a4223c58fa72763a.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324488,"FileSize":969445,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2711\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2711,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:33:19","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 12:19:04","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 12:19:04","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":92,"SubSecTimeDigitized":92,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"43\n[Image]\nOjibway, Porcupine Skin bag (Haupt Coll. del)\nlength, 18 3\/4 inches.\ndiameter. 11 \"\nPorcupine Skin bag\nThe Ojibway indian and the [unclear] tribe doubtless of the Dakota used quantities of Bear grease to anoint their hair and keep it soft and shiny.

When old age comes on the black turns to gray. but no other color is found as a rule among indians in fact this strong tendency for black. hair seems to reach to their half breed descendants\nTo carry the Bear grease necessary to anoint the hair a bag or ? as it has been styled, is made of the skin of the porcupine. an animal is procured and so dexterously skinned that the outer pelt is removed with only a small apperture at the head. the hair and quills are all removed. and the orifices where ever they occur are tied  Into this is put the bear grease. which is used only to anoint the hair. It is indeed very appropriate to select the porcupine as the recipient of the bear grease as both are sacred animals. among the Ojibway. it is said that the indians formerly carried water in such bags but this we doubt. There is no question that they will and do hold water but In the Ojibway country there is no need to carry water it is every where. The present race of indians know them porcupine skin bags with few exceptions only by tradition. they were used in days gone by. but are now obsolete.

The pair of which we give an illustration are made of cotton cloth are white now colored with red pigment and ornamented with porcupine quills dyed green, red, yellow, and purple. these quills are secured to a strip of buckskin and this sewed on the leggin with sinew. The effect of the combination of colors is rich but not necessarily startling the predominant color is green and the others contrast well so that the result is very pleasing. These leggins are of more than usual interest in the fact that they are a pair offered to a ghost and with other presents were placed about the Ghost lodge.   In chapter X Death and Burial we give an account of the Ghost lodge. so will not refer to that at this time. except to say, that this Ghost Lodge was erected at White River camp at Lower Brule Agency S. Dakota. Just before the out break at Pine Ridge in 1890. The top of the leggin is open down to the strip of quill ? below this it is sewed together. To wear them they are drawn over the foot and secured by a garter below the knee. they fit tight and being once put on are expected to stay for a time at least. This brings up the recollection that Mr. George Catlin mentions the fact that the Mandan women and girls in the Summer months repaired to the river every morning for a bath and swim: we have of course no reason to doubt Mr Catlin's statement.

This Love flute is made; or in fact they are seen to be of red cedar. two pieces are hollowed out and fitted together so that they form a tube an inch and a quarter in diameter at the upper end the tube or pipe is contracted and approaches a point, at a proper distance a hole is made in the upper side and fitted with a reed.  to give the notes.  This is composed of a sheet of metal usually in three five unclear words and signs Over the end is a bit of wood shaped like a saddle. and of about three and three quarter inches length. this is adjusted and firmly bound down with a thong of buckskin The barrel of the flute proper is bound together after being cemented with pitch by sinew and dexterously tied so that it shall not unravel. In this specimen the fancy of the sculpter prompted him to carve the head of a 'loon', or great northern diver \"Colymbus glacialis\" upon  the end. The eye is made of a brass headed nail.  The note is modulated by five keys upon the barrel stopped by the fingers. We have seen it stated as a fact that these flutes have six keys and there are drawings extant which show the same. but we take issue with the authenticity for such statements we have carefully examined all the flutes within reach and give illustrations of three all of which have but five keys and while all their specimens had other holes than the keys they are for purpose of ornament and are rest keys.  The head of their flute is adorned with a bunch of ribons two blue and one red. and at the saddle or reed the thing is prolonged into a  loop to hang the flute up.  Most articles of Dakota workmanship have a loop to hang them up by.

If they ever did the art is now lost.  This is a flute or probably more properly a pipe as it has no keys only the reed.  The wood is like the others of red cedar.  The music produced is modified by a softer ? current of air.   The head is that of the deer and the antlers are cut from the same piece as the top of the head.  and are excellently made.   the whole work is well executed and would do great credit to a Yankee whittler or a ? prisoner.  The throat is adorned by a strip of buckskin and a tuft of red feathers.  This specimen is also owned by Rev J H.

One day he was taken with a great giddiness,  and faintness and had to sit down on a log when his nose began to bleed and he knew then that the abandoned squaw was ? a \"Gush kib idge.e.gun.\"  and he said to his companion that he must go to her or he should die, he went married her, and was cured.\nThis love charm is a rare object in collections, the writer has seen only two such one in his own collection the other owned by Mr. Gustav Beauleau. :this later was wrapped in birch bark and had instead of the ring a small wood image of a man and a woman. then ? placed heart to heart, and bound up with the other elements of the charm. In the charm in the authors collection the man and woman are represented by two small pouches of buckskin cut square and beaded on the edges  In both these pouches is a mixture composed of vermillion, a bit of the tongue and heart of a dead body, that has been dug up by the medicine man.  these are pounded to powder and mixed with fragments of a ? stone: \"Gypsums\" in this case.  In one of these pouches is a rare medicine:  the tip of the leaf of a thime herb. \"sage.digorm\". which grows in obscure places.   The two small pouches are placed one on each side of a tin ring and then are wrapped up in a bit of cloth. and three pieces of ribon and finally a strip of bead work and the whole deposited in a small pouch made of buckskin. fringed at the edges. and ornamented with a line of garnet beads and at the bottom is a cross of light blue beads.  The pouch is an ingenious structure and is so made that the elongated side cut into strips and passed through a ? slit holds the pouch shut or closed, and in this condition it may be ?worn? without danger of losing the contents which would of course be fatal to the charm.

And there are cases on record where an old chief being rich in ponies bought more children for wives.  The Ojibway resorts to the Love charm if he fails to secure the coveted prize.

At the head end of the board is a strip which suspends the pappoose, cradle and all from a tree or crotch in frame of the Wigwam or teepee or the mother's head and at times the pommel of a saddle.  The Ojibway cradle is from Lac du Flambeau Wisconsin.\n\n  The Dakota pappoose board is an elaborately beaded affair and consists of a \"frame\" and a \"bonnet\".  the frame is composed of four sticks of wood. (In the Dakota country wood is very scarce and we find that it is sparingly used.)  these are secured together in a rectangular form with a thong of buckskin and ornamented with brass headed nails. probably in former times the frame had other ornament but we never saw a frame that did not have brass nails about it somewhere.   The bonnet is a pair of buffalo hides dress to softness and made in the form of a U open at the lower end.  It forms a bed and sides.  the top being rounded.   This bonnet is elaborately beaded also over the extension.  In this case the ground work is white and the figures ? dark blue, yellow, red and light blue.   Around the head is bent a strap of rawhide that keeps the sides of the bonnet rigid and prevents annoyance to the child.  a small quilt or cushion is placed at the back upon the frame.  wrapped in skins or rags the pappoose is placed in this cradle and by means of the buckskin thongs the sides are tied together and he is a prisoner till released. and they are seldom released.  hour by hour in fact day after day the little fellow is confined in his narrow bed.  he cannot move a limb absolutely. all that is left for him is to sleep. and if awake look right ahead and groan.  His nourishment is administered to him in his cradle the squaw taking the pappoose load and contents under her arm, nurses the infant through the arm hole of her dress.  This done he is hung up again or stood up in a corner.  At the crow agency in Montana we have seen little indians in their pappoose boards standing against the wall of the agency in the broiling sun. their eyes watering from the effect of the strong light without a particle of shade and the dogs licking their faces and they powerless, yet, not a wimper escaped them.

What gave origin to either of these stories we do not know but certain it is we never saw or heard of their being practiced.  It is true on a whole that young children cry very little, but it is due to the fact that they have no cause they have plenty of food.  no scarcity of nourishment exists in the indian breast. and the child soon likes his bed, and crys to be put back in it; and for these reasons there is no occasion to cry white babies cry because they are in distress but the indian would do the same if he were not content.  as a matter of fact he does cry when he feels like it and is allowed to cry till he gets ready to stop. the crying of a baby does not cause its parents to lose a moments repose.\n\n  To speak mildly indian babies are not very clear or sweet. As a proof that early impressions are lasting we have the skull of an adult crow indian which has a flat place on the occipital bone produced by the pressure of his infant head against the pappoose board.   The flat head Indian has a board attached to the cradle with a device to constantly increase the pressure of the board upon the forehead of the pappoose to give the ? flattening of this region of the skull.   When the infant can walk he leaves the board and is carried on Journies or at other times upon the back of his mother enclosed in a fold of her blanket his head only projecting above her shoulders.

The little girl a dress  only and moccasins this is usually the same summer and winter.  The ojibway boy usually has a shirt and the ? white man's pants and the little girls the dress of her mother in summer  the boy is clad in a shirt.\n Names are given to children at an early age. but they generally before they ? a number.

the whole number of totems of the (Chippeway) Ojibway indians is indefinite and he says further that the totem is derived from the \"Dodaim\" a town or village and from this no ?doubt? that as the family grew it formed a village and each village was originally the family residence and it is easy to see that from the fact that each man of that village had the same sign the designation of village or Dodaim was given to that sign or symbol.\n\n  It is stated that most indians can make and do when asked their named make the totem symbol, however true this may have been in years long since gone it is not true at the present day. only one indian in the writers experience knew the totems well enough to draw them. and thus are extremely adverse to drawing them this may be due now to the fact that the indian is now more cautious in his dealings with the whites as he has become wary and shy of the white man and his ways.  However by careful study and searching we have secured authoritative facsimile of twenty totems that exist at present or in the recent past among the Ojibway tribes and by tradition we learn that there are still some others that as yet we have not procured.  the only method of doing so is visiting the grave and examining the totem sticks always there found and this method is hazardous. the writer got in a serious altercation with the Third chief of the Lac du Flambeau tribe for attempting to make a drawing of a totem stick that was stuck in the ground near the grave of one of his ancestors.  Among these which we have not procured but which are known to exist are the \"Bi-Shiw\" - Lynx.  \"Mous\" - Moose (the same as the Elk) \"sucker\"  \"A-dih-a-meg.\" \"White fish\"  \"Amik\"  \"Beaver\"  \"Ga-ya-ashk\"  \"Gull\" \"Hawk\" same as Eagle, \"A-Ji-Jak\" \"Pelican\"\n  The spelling of the names of the various totems being different according to different authors we have add all the variations that have come under our eye. and give a drawing of each as follows.

Life without fire is an almost unendurable thing and the man must be very low in the scales of humanity to exist without it.  Indeed it is the mark of the division between the animal and man that the latter uses a fire  From an early date the Indians of these plains have used the flint and steel with which to ignite the fire.  Among the Dakota tribes the steel consisted of any piece of that metal [....able?] and the flint was a fragment of chirt picked up any where.  The \"Pawnees\" and doubtless others of the plains indians generated fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together at the same time exerting pressure X as shown in the drawing a pointe stick was rubbed between the palms of the hands the point resting in a small pit in a softer piece of wood and the thumb held upon the end of the stick to exert pressure with such an instrument by rigorous effort a spark was produced and ultimately a fire.  The Ojibway so far back as we can discern used the flint and steel   The Fire Steel shown is an authentic specimen and the one carried by \"Aysh-ke-lug-eco.zhay.\"  \"Flat Mouth\" the Head Chief of the Pillager Band of Ojibway in Minnesota.  The broken line shows the outline of the steel when complete or as it was originally made the present aspect shows the usage it has received  To use it the steel was most likely placed around the four fingers and the spark struck out by\nX   W. W. Warner tells me that the early Ojibway also made fire in this way.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114844,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114844","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/14406fdc27e94a8909231201a9020864.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/14406fdc27e94a8909231201a9020864.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/14406fdc27e94a8909231201a9020864.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/14406fdc27e94a8909231201a9020864.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:17:09+00:00","modified":"2021-07-22T04:49:30+00:00","filename":"14406fdc27e94a8909231201a9020864.jpg","authentication":"6cffaf8882907827719e83b5f602e442","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00105_o2.jpg","size":1215640,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2703,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041642345267946002940195882047191844321787357330322265625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["123452"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["123452"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["123452"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["123452"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["123452"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["123452"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"14406fdc27e94a8909231201a9020864.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324491,"FileSize":1215640,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2703\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2703,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:36:37","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 12:34:52","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 12:34:52","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":41,"SubSecTimeDigitized":41,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"87\nImage\nDakota (Sioux) Match pouch.

At the fold of the flap is secured \na loop of buckskin carrying a collection of blue and black beads, a single black bead on each side,\nthe upper end of the loop secures the pouch to the belt.

In making the \"Ma.kuk\" the bark is folded at the sides: Birch bark is peculiar in that it has lines of cleavage in which it splits very easily and in forming the various utensils made of it the indian woman is careful to avoid these lines. hence in folding up the sides to form the end she folds against or [?] side the to the cleavage lines as shown in the \"Birch bark  plate\" cut for making the \"Ma.kuk\".  The dotted lines show the lines in which the bark is folded.

Upon this the decorations are drawn, the skill and ingenuity of the native being exercised in making out designs upon that surface and formerly when \"pictography\" was common among the Ojibway, the surface of the birch bark was the medium upon which they drew.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114863,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114863","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5bed9699e81b2066845ceb80710b5cc3.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5bed9699e81b2066845ceb80710b5cc3.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5bed9699e81b2066845ceb80710b5cc3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5bed9699e81b2066845ceb80710b5cc3.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:17:33+00:00","modified":"2021-08-01T03:29:25+00:00","filename":"5bed9699e81b2066845ceb80710b5cc3.jpg","authentication":"1a4bc1e49f9f32b487475a7a526aeb8c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00124_o2.jpg","size":1069341,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2696,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.03672591081437499849204897373056155629456043243408203125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124325"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124325"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124325"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124325"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124325"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124325"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5bed9699e81b2066845ceb80710b5cc3.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324491,"FileSize":1069341,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2696\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2696,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:37:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 12:43:25","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 12:43:25","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":68,"SubSecTimeDigitized":68,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"104\n[Four images]\nPlan    Haupt.

The sides of this decoy are covered with plates of tin.

This decoy the indian  upon the ice and within his \"lean-to\"  lowers and raised in the water by a thong attached to the ring.  The ingenuity of this decoy in this becomes apparent.  When it is drawn upward the water presses against the  lateral fin from above and the decoy hanging in an angular position the body is urged forward when it is lowered the lead in the head end causes that to descend first.and the pressure of the water on the lateral fins from beneath raises the tail and the decoy is urged forward and by bending the tail to one side the decoy circles round beneath the hole in the ice similar to a minnow with up and down motion.  The large fish seeing this decoy in motion darts at it and comes close to the hole, but detecting their  error stop and as it were pause in the water at which moment the spear of the indian transfixes them.  the spear is a pole about an inch or more thick and two sides of the end of which are fastened barbed iron prongs six and three quarter inches long. and one quarter inch thick.

Prior to that date the only means was doubtless the trap or shooting them with the bow and arrow.  At certain seasons of the year in the spring the accumulation of fish in obstructed places is such that they can be caught in the hand. an indian standing in the stream could literally pick up all the fish he needed and many more.\n\n   When a fish is captured and taken to the wigwam it is put hole [sic] and undressed into a pot or kettle and boiled and eaten. every thing except the bones and scales and fins.  a fried or brilled [sic] fish the indian never dreampt of and in many cases fish are and have from time immemorial been eaten raw by this savage nation.  \n  The Ojbway indians eat the raw flesh of the deer and moose.  At Lake Winnibigoshish in Minnesota in A.D. 1891 the writer saw the Ojibway eatting the raw flesh of a freshly killed moose and the children cracking and gnawing the marrow bones.   The Ojibway so far as we know is the only indian race addicted to eating human flesh but they tell within recent times did do so. and it is possible that even at this date in the more distant districts in extreme situations it may be resorted to.   It is said that within the century a family in great destitution living in the north were reduced to such strayghts that the mother killed her son a boy sixteen years of age and the father and she ate him.  She decoyed the boy into putting his head in her lap for the purpose of searching for vermin and while in that attitude poured molten lead into his ear and so killed him.  We have known of instances of cruelty practices among the indian upon their enemies and will have ocasion to relate some of them but there are few cases on record to equal this.\n  The fact of this horrid proclivity existing among the Ojibway would it seems point to a reversion in these practices to an earlier race from which they were derived, the heart of an enemy was frequently eaten by them to engender bravery.   There is no reason for the necessity to eat human flesh.  animals and fish are as a rule very abundant in the Ojibway and Dakota country and in the absence of animal diet the supply of vegetables is plenty as the Ojibway has learned to eat all varieties of flesh.  The bison, otter, porcupine, musk rat and other animals are all eaten and our friend the Honorable Henry M Rice told the writer that he partook of a very satisfying meal made of Musk rat stewed with the bark of the maple tree.  The writer ate porcupine cooked by a squaw in the indian fashion and while it would no doubt sustain life and may [?] to the indian palate been delightful, these and other articles of diet and methods of cooking we prefer the meat beside being tough were very astringent owing the fact that the animal fed on pine cones and sweet from the administration of maple sugar introduced by the \"chef\".","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114869,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114869","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8f86efc11569c125c52a75dfa9f0b7cd.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8f86efc11569c125c52a75dfa9f0b7cd.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8f86efc11569c125c52a75dfa9f0b7cd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8f86efc11569c125c52a75dfa9f0b7cd.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:17:41+00:00","modified":"2021-08-02T04:28:15+00:00","filename":"8f86efc11569c125c52a75dfa9f0b7cd.jpg","authentication":"9b07cc6e6f32ebaa65bb5e463ae3acb6","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00131_o2.jpg","size":914278,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2711,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.031226621309617001720493334460115875117480754852294921875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124454"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124454"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124454"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124454"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124454"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124454"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8f86efc11569c125c52a75dfa9f0b7cd.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324492,"FileSize":914278,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2711\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2711,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:38:34","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 12:44:54","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 12:44:54","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":72,"SubSecTimeDigitized":72,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"110\n[Image]\nDakota (Sioux) Pemican mallet.

In the dry plains where food is so scarce that the Dakota may Journey for days and find no animal to kill for food, other than a rattle snake, the pemican plays an important part in sustaining life  a quantity of pemican stowed away in a bag usually forms a part of every indians out fit and when over taken by hunger a pinch of pemican is put into his mouth and allowed to macerate and is finally swallowed containing no salt it produces no thirst or its use would cause the most intense torture.  The Dakota country unlike that of the Ojibway furnishes no water that is potable except in the rivers the ponds and spring under in the snow capped mountain regions are alkaline and bitter, hence the Dakota indian may travel for days without a drink of water.  The Pemican Mallet and its use naturally leads to the discussion of method of making the mallet heads and other stone implements.   The subject of arrow and spear heads is treated of in another place.   The Dakota indian uses a good deal of stone of the harder variety in his domestic life and at war, the articles he uses are as a rule such as may be easily adapted from materials he finds ready to his hand in nature.   In our drawing we show the method of forming the head of a war club.  The rounded stone picked up at the river bank or elsewhere that will answer the purpose is held in one hand and placed upon a stone as an anvil with another stone he pounds the rock to be worked turning it from side to side and shifted the position till the required form is obtained,  By holding the rock as shown a [?] effect is obtained from the blow one on top by direct action the other beneath forms resistance.  To form gneiss stones having an edge are selected.  In some cases the war clubs and other articles are left in the rough state, others and notably the war club is rubbed down upon a rock till it is smooth about polished.  In these cases however it is usually only such articles as are to be left uncovered.  Those which are covered with a covering of skin usually  are left in the rough state.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114875,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114875","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/cde3c8643699d8187e1a401a9064c2f2.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/cde3c8643699d8187e1a401a9064c2f2.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/cde3c8643699d8187e1a401a9064c2f2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cde3c8643699d8187e1a401a9064c2f2.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:17:49+00:00","modified":"2021-08-07T03:43:05+00:00","filename":"cde3c8643699d8187e1a401a9064c2f2.jpg","authentication":"a1adecd64cc89c2d8bbc2890e88e00b4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00138_o2.jpg","size":1112488,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2703,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.038108822844301996901617002322382177226245403289794921875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124701"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124701"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124701"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124701"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124701"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124701"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cde3c8643699d8187e1a401a9064c2f2.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324492,"FileSize":1112488,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2703\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2703,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:39:00","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 12:47:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 12:47:01","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":21,"SubSecTimeDigitized":21,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"116\n[Image]\nblade\nOjibway curved knife used in making bowls.

The handle of this knife is of hard wood cut as is seen with a horse head upon it by way of ornament as we have elsewhere remarked the Ojibway indians do a good dal of carving except on pipes we recall no carved mark among the Dakota.  this may be due to the absence of wood among that people but it would seem that even their articles made of wood they have and [?] they prefer beads and quill to carving as a means of ornamentation. of course now and then we find departures from this rule as in the carved par flesche in another place.

It is stated that it was buried with an indian who was interred in the same ground and from the concern about circumstances it would seem reasonable to suppose that this knife had been carried by an Ojibway whose last resting place was disturbed to make room for a second the statement is that it was \"three feet beneath the deep surface.\"   that is exactly the depth of a grave opened at Twin Lake, Michigan and there seems to be little doubt but that the former owner of the specimen was an Ojibway the important question then arises if so, did he make it?  This is not of easy solution;  In 1664 at Pierre Boucher published an account of the manner in which he says the Ojibway indians in Wisconsin procured copper in a certain place is a huge nugget of copper and he says \"(as they pan it, they make fires on top of it and then hew pieces out of it with their axes.\"  Another writer, \"Allouez.\" says that the indian on the South shore of Lake Superior frequently found and carried nuggets of copper he adds \"they look upon these as so many divinities or as presents made to them by the gods who are at the bottom of the lake to be the cause of their good fortune.\"  apropos to this the writer in opening a mound on the shore of one of the northern Wisconsin lakes discovered the crumbling skeleton of an indian dweller and of the\"Adujanues\"  \"Foxes\" who had perished in the [?] of  which the mound was the remains and with the loner was a nugget of copper wrapped in buckskin and birch bark.  It would seem however that in this instance the good fortune failed this indian.  In 1730 A.D. LaRonde, an officer at \"Chagouanigon Bay\" reported that the indians had nuggets of copper but would not reveal the places where it was mined.  L. Simonin \"Underground Life\"  1869 gives  pictures of the stone hammers used by the \"Kayoway\" Indians of \"North America\" in their copper mines.  The fact seems to be that the Ojibway and the indians of the region of Northern Wisconsin did use copper. at the same time it is not clear whether or not they made weapons of that material","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114877,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114877","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7e1d4dbfc6199539e55ed1a03c02e173.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7e1d4dbfc6199539e55ed1a03c02e173.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7e1d4dbfc6199539e55ed1a03c02e173.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7e1d4dbfc6199539e55ed1a03c02e173.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:17:51+00:00","modified":"2021-08-08T04:31:10+00:00","filename":"7e1d4dbfc6199539e55ed1a03c02e173.jpg","authentication":"381bad5357ec942d1389029d18571d4e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00140_o2.jpg","size":1530491,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2737,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051776444877467998895159695393886067904531955718994140625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124736"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124736"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124736"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124736"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124736"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124736"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7e1d4dbfc6199539e55ed1a03c02e173.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324492,"FileSize":1530491,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2737\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2737,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:39:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 12:47:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 12:47:36","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":91,"SubSecTimeDigitized":91,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"118\nour opinion is that they did.  At Sandy Lake in Minnesota are constantly being unearthed copper specimens.  Before the advent of the white man and the establishment of a trading post at that point by the Northwestern Fur company that locality was unfrequented by the indians and all these specimens are the droppings as it were of the visiting Ojibway.  it is by no means likely at all that all of them had been found or unearthed by the Ojibway. they in our mind made them.  The specimens which we show in chapter IX from the \"Wakefield collection\" were found near the surface and certainly had been dropped by indians visiting Sandy Lake since the white man went there.  These deductions we draw not to uphold a theory but simply from the facts presented to us and the logical analogy following therefrom   The Ojibway in former days before the white man brought them knives and steel weapons preserved and used copper implements and weapons from whence had they they if they did not fashion them?  Our opinion is that the Ojibway or Algic indians were the successor of the \"Mound builders\" and that the \"Mound Builders\" descended from the ancient Druids [?] but no one not prepared to admit that all the copper implements that are being frequently discovered on the surface and beneath it in Wisconsin and elsewhere are all extremely ancient and belong to a race prehistoric.  That the Mound Builders did live and form copper implements centuries ago. we do not dispute but it does not by any means follow that knives and other articles found at the present day upon the surface (or near it) of the ground are the production of \"Mound Builders.\"  although they are similar to specimens exhumed from mounds assuming that the Algic and Ojibway indians are descendants of the \"Mound Builders\" it is safe to say that their arts and skill has been handed down. and that the great number of \"coppers\" found throughout the country noted are the work of the recent race rather than the former but the limit of our space will not permit our going deeper into this subject and we reluctantly leave it with this comment Rev. W. W. Hanes seems to be of the opinion that the Ojibway indians did not work the copper mines of Lake Superior and other regions and that the implements being from time to time discarded in that region are the remnants of the[?] former race his reasoning is good but the question naturally arises if it be true that the ancient Ojibway did not mine and work copper from whence did the indians procure the great number of copper implements as knives, spear and arrow points which are found constantly in different pats of their country upon turning over the ground not buried deeply but as it were upon the surface and in places where it has only been since the Ojibway history commenced here have visited by them   Our opinion is that when the necessity for it existed the Ojibway did work the copper mines.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114878,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114878","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/6a5a26271718b0e811a682b788cf51a5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/6a5a26271718b0e811a682b788cf51a5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/6a5a26271718b0e811a682b788cf51a5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6a5a26271718b0e811a682b788cf51a5.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:17:53+00:00","modified":"2021-08-09T03:53:27+00:00","filename":"6a5a26271718b0e811a682b788cf51a5.jpg","authentication":"4802576816f2e240d2e1f719a9cd025e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00141_o2.jpg","size":1167787,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2696,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040106982910209997006401039243428385816514492034912109375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124756"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124756"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124756"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124756"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124756"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124756"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6a5a26271718b0e811a682b788cf51a5.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324492,"FileSize":1167787,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2696\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2696,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:39:16","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 12:47:56","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 12:47:56","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":41,"SubSecTimeDigitized":41,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"119\n[Image]\nDakota (Sioux) Knife sheath.

I have elsewhere exhibited the manner of wearing them in that situation.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114880,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114880","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/91552608cc62088e17c3ab5ac6d41c77.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/91552608cc62088e17c3ab5ac6d41c77.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/91552608cc62088e17c3ab5ac6d41c77.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/91552608cc62088e17c3ab5ac6d41c77.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:17:55+00:00","modified":"2021-08-09T04:42:44+00:00","filename":"91552608cc62088e17c3ab5ac6d41c77.jpg","authentication":"dad1925285d819320c5ed1e5f520d9eb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00144_o2.jpg","size":1092823,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2696,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.03753238680074699740174537510029040277004241943359375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124846"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124846"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124846"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124846"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["124846"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["124846"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"91552608cc62088e17c3ab5ac6d41c77.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324492,"FileSize":1092823,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2696\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2696,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:39:26","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 12:48:46","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 12:48:46","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":69,"SubSecTimeDigitized":69,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"121\n[Three images]\nHaupt\nDakota (Sioux) - Horn dish, owned by \"Mato.wa.na.rta.ka\".

The bowl and spoon from the Haupt Collection of Ojibway manufacture is made of birds eye maple and is of a round shape with high sides on to the bowl.  the spoon is made with a rather flat bowl and of a shape similar to that of the Maple sugar ladle only of course smaller.  The bowl is nearly four inches deep and a little over ten inches wide at the top.  such wooden bowls are now extremely rare among the Ojibway the china & tin plates of the white man has entirely superseded them  However such dishes are preserved and handed down in the family for generations.   This one was procured at Lac du Flambeau, in Wisconsin and shows signs of great age.   The spoon is very redolent with greece and the edges show [?] signs of use.   It is the custom when the \"Great Medicine Men\" meet together to have a feast and eat from such wooden dishes they are kept for that purpose and are held sacred.   They believe that in such feasts the Great spirit comes down and eats with them.   this specimen was an \"heirloom\" for many years.   The wood is \"[?]\" burl and is strong.   The wooden dish made by the Dakotas is a more elliptical and flatter article and unlike the other has a projection and holes in it by which it may be hung up.   We have noticed among the Dakota that all their utensils are provided with the means of hanging them up off the ground.  we would never accuse the indian of being either so careful or cleanly as to take such precautions.  let us as think that the realization of the fact that did they not do so any thing that had an suspicion of greese or fat about it would be stollen away by the dogs and other vermin.   The Ojibway have more permanent dwellings and keep their utensils on a shelf or store them away out of reach.

Mr. Warren tells us that the early Ojibway ground this awl from the thigh bone of a muskrat and he also says \"A stone tied to the end of a stick\" xx assumed the purpose of an axe.\"  This description give a rather erroneous impression of the craft.   The stone is always very securely fastened to the stick. it is usually secured by having the stick bent once or twice about it and being then tightly tied with raw hide.  We feel a little skepticle also about the muskrat bone awl  we give a drawing of an awl which was obtained from an old indian spring near the town of [?] in Wisconsin.   This is an awl the point being restored and is the \"os calci\" of the deer.  The small size of the musk rat bones render it very highly unlikely that these bones were used the indian is not a dainty maker and while the thigh one of a musk-rat would make a delicate awl it is too fine for the uses of an indian and for this our authority can hardly be substantiated by fact the fact seems to be that a piece of bone capable of being grasped in the hand and [?] to a point which was capable of being [?] through a skin or pieces of leather answered the purpose of an awl.   In the spring at the time the other specimens were found several others were also discovered.   This one fell to the [?] of our friend Dr. W. A. Phillips of Evanston Ills. and the others were scattered.  The bone is well preserved of a dark brown color and shows on the point unmistakable marks of use exhibits a number of scratches.

The scraper whether of brass or flint was used to remove the flesh and hair among the Dakota and early Ojibway now the Ojibway use an iron scraper of which later.   The process is now among the Dakota to prepare these robes was to stretch the green hide upon the ground and cutting [?] in the edge to fasten it to the ground with pegs. in this condition the flesh is scraped off with the scraper. the skins of all animals contains more or less adhering flesh and fat and these are scraped off and the hides worked with the scraper to remove from it all superfluous flesh and or fat.   The skin as it lays stretched on the ground is [?] from time to time and worked with the scraper.  the heat of the plains and the moisture added causes a certain degree of fermentation in the skin this locks up the tissue and eliminates the fat and flesh when these have been removed the hide is left with the hair and enough of the tissue to hold it when this situation is realised the skin is smeared with the brains or other fatty parts of the animal and moistened with water and the grease rubbed in the rubbing is continued till the skin is soft and the robe finished.  To prepare buckskin the method is similar to that to be described under the Ojibway method of curing skins.  Buffalo robes are no longer to be preserved and the Dakota have fallen into the practice of dressing the skins of the beef cattle served out to them by the United States Government for food, but these are of course few and usually for between the [?]  so the supply of robes is small and the [?] cattle having short hair the robe is of a poor quality it will keep out the wind however and that is really now its only use.   The Ojibway have for many years 4 unclear words   and now as a rule use robes the skin they use the smaller fur bearing animals and deer, Moose, Carito & Elk skin for the moccasins.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114891,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114891","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f725ee41639f416bf2459cc7f03f02fe.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f725ee41639f416bf2459cc7f03f02fe.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f725ee41639f416bf2459cc7f03f02fe.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f725ee41639f416bf2459cc7f03f02fe.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:18:09+00:00","modified":"2021-08-17T04:30:09+00:00","filename":"f725ee41639f416bf2459cc7f03f02fe.jpg","authentication":"6bd81655b2f91bbfd03dd2ef15f1a84e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00155_o2.jpg","size":1024375,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2711,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.034986918862795000906285025621400563977658748626708984375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["125156"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["125156"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["125156"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["125156"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["125156"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["125156"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f725ee41639f416bf2459cc7f03f02fe.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324493,"FileSize":1024375,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2711\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2711,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:40:13","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 12:51:56","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 12:51:56","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":13,"SubSecTimeDigitized":13,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"132\nFour images\nOjibway squaw removing hair from a skin.

The sewing of the muccisin and the securing of the beads and quills is in the indian and genuine muccisin done with sinew - the tendons of the larger animals and dried and then pounded with a [?] of the Pemican mallet till they are seperated into the filliments and with these the indian woman does her sewing such thread never breaks.  At present they sew with a steel needle formerly the awl was used.  This V shaped upper [?] the beads or other ornament.  In this case the ornament is only beads.   The first row is white, the second blue then red. in the center is a  band of red and yellow triangles running along the tip of the foot flanked by a line of blue beads and the rest of the spaces filled with yellow beads   Across the instep is a transverse band of blue, white and red beads arranged in triangles.   To the instep is sewed a tongue of an angular shape as to this there is no regularity in shape some meccesins have a forked tongue others a uniform straight piece.

In the Meccesin in the Billin collection from the Lower Brul\u00e9 Agency the upper is ornamented with quills in lines radiating from the instep and this meccesin shows a leggin made of buffalo skin a piece of a robe doubtless used to protect the leg in the extreme cold winter of the plains.  the indian meccesin and leggin is his shoe and stocking and this is usually donned at the beginning of winter and then remains till spring.   This is tied along the side with six thongs of skin and has a height of thirteen inches.   Tho not infrequently is antelope rather than buck skin.  This leggin being shaggy is very warm and prevents the wearer from \nInsert Winter Meccisin & Leggin\ntaking cold when he gets his feet wet in fact in stormy weather or rain they are generally in that condition but the indian minds it no more than does his dogs.

In the muccesin we find a good illustration of the influence of the environment upon the animal.   The Ojibway meccisin is all of soft bucksskin sole and upper.  the Dakota makes a tough raw hide sole for the reason that his country abounds with cactus and prickly pear and a meccesin such as the Ojibway wears is useless.   The upper as described is sewed like the Dakota with sinews along the straight edge at the heel sometimes leaving the piece taken out of the notch hanging as a tab at the heel.   The front is sewed along the middle line and puckered up on the instep to fit a rounded piece set on the tip of the foot analogous to the tongue.  By some writers as we have explained in the chapter on History state that this puckering of the meccesin gave origin to the name Ojibway which they say means \"Puckered\" &c This tongue is in the Ojibway moccesin the only part of the foot or upper that is beaded","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114896,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114896","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/20e49608e8036ccdd6ea12f8f0c97a04.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/20e49608e8036ccdd6ea12f8f0c97a04.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/20e49608e8036ccdd6ea12f8f0c97a04.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/20e49608e8036ccdd6ea12f8f0c97a04.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:18:16+00:00","modified":"2021-08-22T04:21:05+00:00","filename":"20e49608e8036ccdd6ea12f8f0c97a04.jpg","authentication":"b7a9f561ed91b678809e9d9c2b14adf3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00160_o2.jpg","size":888591,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2737,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0300609954126580015965064518468352616764605045318603515625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["125307"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["125307"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["125307"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["125307"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["125307"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["125307"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"20e49608e8036ccdd6ea12f8f0c97a04.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324493,"FileSize":888591,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2737\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2737,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:40:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 12:53:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 12:53:07","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":60,"SubSecTimeDigitized":60,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"137\nabout the back of the meccesin is sewed a collar like strip which is also variously beaded and ornamented with ribon but to the authors recollection the Ojibway moccesin is never ornamented with porcupine quills as is the Dakota although they use the quills for other purposes   This heel piece or collar is secured about the  upper edge of the upper a part of it extending below the edge and this free edge it is that carries the beads.

Entering the camp he sat down and observed at his side a pair of diminutive snow shoes and picked them up to examine the workmanship  while so doing a small indian boy probably four years of age who had taken refuge behind his father scrambled out of his hiding place and found his snow shoes and brought them over to the writer to be examined too and so amused were we at this that we gave the little fellow a looking glass which we carried for trading with the natives.

This meccessin is the work of the Phirasorca Apache of New Mexico and is an ingenious device the Apache country abounds with cactus probably pear and Spanish Bayonet and the meccesin is made with a view to protect the foot and leg from injury.   The sole is cut from a thick piece of buffalo hide that of the neck usually being selected.  it is left in the raw state the hair not removed. the hair side is dense and the edges of the side turned up.   The sole is prolonged at the toe into a kind of prow or fender which projects above the foot about two inches.  In the specimen chosen it is formed like a button spreading at the tip but others shapes may be given it.   To the inner edge of he sole the upper is very dexterously sewed so that the stitches are on the in side and are not visible from without the sole is wider also than the upper and protect the foot in the tread.  Incased in such a covering the foot is protected against the injury liable to occur from the very sharp thorns of the luxuriant vegetation that cover the apache country.  The only ornament on this moccasin is a few black lines about the toe and at the summit of the leggin which is inordinately long being forty two and a half inches  the leg is drawn up and tied above the knee with a thong and the end allowed to fall over.   at the ankles is a thong to keep the moccesin snug on the foot and prevent its slipping about.

The snow shoe is secured to the foot by means of the thong shown in the centre.  At first sight it would seem impossible for an indian or any one to walk in such device but the fact is it is an easy matter not only to walk but run and Jump in snowshoes as the writer can testify.  To secure the shoe the ends of the thongs are passed through the holes as shown the central figure.  the loop then drawn up so that when the foot is placed on the web of the shoe and the [?loop?] rests Just above the heel the ball of the foot shall come on the backward edge of the central hole.

The strand from the other side is similarly treated and the ends tied at the ankle.  Thus tied the snow shoe is secure and great freedom is acquired for action.

Kinnikinnik plant, (Cornus Sericea.)

Tobacco with the northern indians is a rare article and as it is not cultivated by them must be procured by trade and is expensive and is now used only mixed with this Kinnikinnik and has become a recognized article of incense to be smoked to gratify the Great Spirit.  The indian is a devote animal and he feels that the nostrils of the Manito are gratified and his spirit appeased by the odor of burning tobacco.   The thing with them is that a little is as efficacious as a great deal hence the more costly tobacco is mixed with the more easily procured Kinnikinnik.  The article is popularly spoken of as the bark of the \"Red Willow\"   We consulted several living authorities upon this subject and they all said in reply to the question do you know the plant from which the indians make their Kinnikinnik and the reply always was it is the \"Red Willow.\" that grows along the streams.  However not satisfied we pushed  into the indian country with the same question and at Lake Wennebegoshike found an indian through the courtesy of Mr. Fairchild who knew the plant and further knew how to prepare it for use.  We are enabled to give a correct description.  The writer went with \"Billy Washington\" (the indian) into the shrubbery and \"Billy\" cut some of the plant and from it made for the writer a sample of the finished Kinnikinnik which we will describe later.

situations green or brown.  the slender usually straight branches or trunk with the some what willow shaped leaf has given rise to the erroneous conclusion that the plant is the \"Red Willow.\"   The method of preparing the shrub for the pipe is as follows.  the stems are cut as near the ground (and let us remark the shrub usually grows in shady places and reaches a height of about six to ten feet) as convenient and the branch  es cut off so that only the long slender stems are used.  and these are taken and with a knife held so as to cut backward similar to a draw knife the thin red or outer bark is stripped off this is readily done as the cortical portion separates easily.  When the red is all removed from the entire stick the green bark is scraped off from the [?wood?] with the back of the knife and comes away in long ribbons. these are collected upon a piece of birch bark or any suitable means and when enough has been obtained the ribons are dried either upon a piece of cedar split up into strips in the fashion of a  fan or as \"Billy Washington\" dried it upon a  tin plate set up on a stick. in an inclined position before a fire. when thoroughly dry the bark is quite friable and is [?broken?] by rubbing in the hand.  This then is the Kinnikinnik in its original and genuine form.  There are however a number of spurious kind  used for instance in the absence of he [?] the [?] of Bear berry. \"Arctostaphylos Nivi Ursi\" [Spurge} which grows abundantly in the woods of our northern states. and is a trailing vine springing from a common center in radial lines this is collected dried and smoked as the genuine in case of necessity.   The Partridge berry or Mitchella ripem [(?)] a slender trailing vine common in much of the [?] states is according to the authority of Mr. Gustave Beauleau another substitute for the true kinnikinnik.\n\n  The description of the kinnikinnik is that made and used by the Ojibway and it is probable the Dakotas use the same plant. at the same time there is a difference in the mixture of the ingridients as will be apparent from the narrative related to the writer by Hon. Henry M Rice in [?] Paul.

Phillips Coll.  Haupt del.)\nDrill, from sketch, made from photograph in Phillips Collection.\n\n\nThe Dakotas, as well no doubt as the Ojibway, used the chirt drill to bore the rock in making their pipes.  We have found the drill in use among the recent tribes and the chirt points are not an uncommon occurrence in the collections.  In the specimen of which we have given a drawing the point of the drill is gone.   The remaining fragment is one and three quarter inches long   The head is one and one eights inches wide. and one quarter of an inch thicke.  The shaft of the drill is six sixteenths wide and four sixteenths thick. having an eliptical section.  This specimen is from the collection of Dr. Wm. A. Phillips and was found at Jackson Illinois it is of white chirt and very carefully chipped.  In the Phillips collection is also a photograph of a drill mounted and the bar with [?] it is used.  It consists of a shaft of wood into a slit in the lower end of which is fitted the drill point, this is not a difficult task as the upper end of the head of the drill is tapered to make it chisel pointed and this can be easily adjusted to the shaft  The upper end of the shaft is rounded and fits into a bucket of  mud  this Bucket is any bit of wood at hand.  the drill is operated by the bow which has a cord passing around the shaft of the drill and by running the end back and forward the drilling is accomplished    Such a drill as this has not been in use among the indians for many years since the advent of the white man.  the file has in a great measure superseeded the old stone drill.  now the calumet  pipes which formerly were drilled with the bow and drill are now drilled with a file that is sthe end of it.   The reasons for this is obvious the file is formed ready to hand and is [?] more durable.  the stone drill is difficult to make and easily broken.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114906,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114906","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ed6d70c3061da6e8c867f35421da763a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ed6d70c3061da6e8c867f35421da763a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ed6d70c3061da6e8c867f35421da763a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ed6d70c3061da6e8c867f35421da763a.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:18:29+00:00","modified":"2021-08-30T03:15:08+00:00","filename":"ed6d70c3061da6e8c867f35421da763a.jpg","authentication":"f3b906abcec2a366ef8fc684a41403c5","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00170_o2.jpg","size":911635,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2703,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0312285046792999988751748929871610016562044620513916015625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["130819"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["130819"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["130819"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["130819"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["130819"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["130819"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ed6d70c3061da6e8c867f35421da763a.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324493,"FileSize":911635,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2703\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2703,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:41:17","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 13:08:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 13:08:19","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":73,"SubSecTimeDigitized":73,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"147\n\n The subject of Drills naturally leads us to a consideraton of the construction of the great \"calumet\" of indian pipe.

This stone is a variety of steatite so called and is and has been quarried only in Southwestern Minnesota at a place called Pipe Stone. in the county of the same name.  we give a map of the region made from the authors notes and which we believe to be in the main a correct drawing of this region.  Our author says that the Dakotas in whose country it is say that this stone was given them by the Great Spirit for their pipes and for nothing else and that it is strictly forbidden to use it for other purposes.\n\n  The method used by the Dakota as described by Mr Cattin differs from that shown in our out of the drill but we are led to believe that this drill is probably the most correct Cattlin says that the bowl is shaped out with a knife and that the hole is drilled into the bowl with a hard strike of the [crossed out:  proper size] proper size \"with a quantity of sharp sand. and water kept constantly in the hole.\"  this does not seem a likely method as it partakes to [sic] much of the white man's ways. and we are inclined to doubt it. and lay more reliance upon the chirt drill. as a means of boring than the stick and sharp sand.\n\nThe sacred Pipe Stone Quarry the fame of which has reached all the indian tribes is in the South western corner of the State of Minnesota.  Mr. Cattin in his Second Volume of \"Cattin's Eight Years\" gives a sketchy picture of the quarry as he saw it in AD 1886.  It is a rather fantastic sketch and conveys an erronius idea of the locality.  The view he depicts is taken from the north west looking toward the South east.  In this picture the back ground is cut off by a wall of rock which appears to be of great height and is described as being \"twenty five and thirty feet in elevation\".  We measured the cliff at the face and found it sixteen feet and this we believe to be the highest point that is the [?] cliff is highest at this place in as much as the falling water has washed away the debris at the foot and deepened the ca\u00f1on if it may be so designated.  In the Cattin picture five high boulders are shown all in a perfectly straight line which is incorrect first because there are six of these boulders and second because they are not in a straight line, a glance at the accompanying map will show the relative position of the sisters and their relation to the old indian granaries and the white man's quarry. as well as the chimney of each known as Gitchi Manito.

It is most likely that the stone was discovered by the outcrop in former days protruding at the surface now however the grass has grown over the face of the country and repeated seasons have buried the stone, at these quarries the superimposed earth is forty three (43) inches, then a stratum pf pink quartz, of the same thickness and then follows the pipe stone in a stratum eight (8) inches thick broken up into layers the thickest of which is two (2) inches. this is the layer from which the stone for the pipes is procured the others being too narrow for the purpose. beneath the pipe stone is a second stratum of pink quartz. the dip of these strata is 10\u00ba ten degree to the east.   It has always been the custom with the indian to secrete the stone and when a quarry was made it was invariably covered up when the stone was removed. so that the place could not be found the result is that we find these old pits with the debris scattered about extending for some distance of recent years the red men have become [?cooler?] about filling up the pits and quite a number are open.

The presence of the [?boulders?] of gray granite in the middle of the prairie is a mystery. not only to the indians but [?suspense?] the white man [?] as there is not a fragment of granite any where in the country except these boulders the fact naturally impressed the natives with solemnity and they pay reverences to these rocks as \"Manito\"   The tradition is extant among the Dakotas that under these boulders lied two squaws. the guardian spirits of the quarry and that they live there eternally.  In former days before an indian attempted to dig the pipe stems he in great reverence he approached the five sisters and stopping before he got too close, made a supplication  by throwing tobacco to the Spirits solicited permission to quarry the pipe stone.

It is said that beneath the boulders are two  [?] or pits the abode of the Spirit if such was the case in 1836 AD, the Spirits must have taken to themselves [?] since for in 1892 we saw no evidence of such excavations.\n\n  This red pipe stone has for a great many years been an article of traffic among the indian tribes and it would seem was the object of many of their wars and conflicts. the Quarry has for all time so far as the white man knew any thing about it been in the possession of the Dakota people. and was sought after by the succeeding races. the Ojibway own a few red stone pipes, and only a few, and they procured them from the Dakota country.  A legend is extant among the Dakota peoples that  the Sacred pipe stone is the petrified blood of the Ojibway.The story is that at one time way, way back in time the Ojibway wanted to take the hunting ground and pipe stone quarry away from the Dakotas and they mustered all their forces and attacked the Dakotas at this place, a terrible conflict ensued and the Ojibway were killed and slaughtered to a man and so bloody [?] fight that the earth was saturated with blood.   This blood seeped awa into the ground and was by the Manito turned into stone so that the indians could have it for a material for their sacred pipes.   The story is told of an indian Dakota who took a piece of the stone and held it to his bare arm and said to the white man this is our flesh, the flesh of the indian so it is sacred.  In the early days when the white man was first permitted to visit the locality the stone was preserved by the indians with the greatest care. and was used by them for no purposes whatever except that of making the pipe.   On one occasion a trader after a good deal of persuasion procured a piece of the stone from an indian and made from it a \"dish\".  this so incensed the indians that they wanted that white man's scalp as he had desecrated their acred stone.  Now however the charm is broken fragments of the stone are to be picked up any where. and in the town of Pipe Stone hard by the quarry any one may purchase articles made of it as \"shop made curios\".

If a chief refused to smoke and passed the pipe it was evidence that he would not agree to the terms and was still hostile  With the degeneration of indian customs incident to the comings of the white man the smoking of the calumet  as a mark of assent to a treaty has in a great means become obslite [sic].  Treaties are now signed with the pen and the indian makes his mark or holds the pen.   The pipe is  however always present in the council each indian carrying his own pipe and smoking it.  Among the Ojibway the pipe is smoked at their ceremonies of worship as we will see under that head.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114913,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114913","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8e0fe61a1cfbec0d2187e813026fa981.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8e0fe61a1cfbec0d2187e813026fa981.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8e0fe61a1cfbec0d2187e813026fa981.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8e0fe61a1cfbec0d2187e813026fa981.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:18:38+00:00","modified":"2021-09-04T04:35:19+00:00","filename":"8e0fe61a1cfbec0d2187e813026fa981.jpg","authentication":"c0174fce9d9bca30c90dc2815c0463c2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00177_o2.jpg","size":906797,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2695,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0311549852264139982838120346286814310587942600250244140625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["131001"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["131001"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["131001"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["131001"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["131001"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["131001"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8e0fe61a1cfbec0d2187e813026fa981.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324494,"FileSize":906797,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2695\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2695,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:41:43","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 13:10:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 13:10:01","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":77,"SubSecTimeDigitized":77,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"153\n[Image]\nDakota (Sioux) Pipe.

The decoration of the pipe stem consists of a band of feathers from the head of the Mallard duck. a piece of the skin is taken off with the five green feathers attached this is glued to the stem over the tuft, and tassle of [crossed out: red] horses  hair dyed red and over the feathers  is tied a green ribon. from this point to the end the stem is wrapped with the plaited porcupine quills ingeniously woven in figures. adjoining the tuft is a band of the quills dyed carmine. succeeded by a narrow band of yellow and one of green. they occupy about a fourth of the space covered with quills.  In the center  is a wide space filled with white quills in which are [?] figures in green and yellow.  The two rectangular figures have [crossed out:  yellow] red quills in the center surrounded by yellow and a border of green.   The mouth end of the stem is finished as the lower end except that the ribon in two strands is red.  Accompanying this pipe is \"Tobacco Bag\" in this bag both the pipe and tobacco is carried at times though usually upon ceremonies the pipe is carried in the hand and the bag held at the throat accompanies it.   The bag is a rectangular buckskin receptical open at the top or small end. which [?part?] is six and a half inches wide the length being twenty and one quarter inches.  It would seem that this article is of recent introduction among the indians.  Mr Cattin in his work while showing numerous pipes and pouches made of skin of animals no where shows a picture of the buckskin bag ornamented with beads and quills now so unusual among the indians of all nations the Dakota especially devotes much time and care to the making of these bags and it is the rule for each pipe to be accompanied with a tebacco bag of this form. and it seems strange that if [?] it be true that they did not at this time exist Cattin should have over looked them. and yet it seems strange that if they are the introduction of recent times they should have so rapidly reached to all parts of the nations as there is really very little intercourse between the remote branches of the tribes.   The specimen accompanying this pipe of \"Smoke Maker\" is a very handsome piece of work.   The mouth of the bag is ornamented with red. turquoise blue. and dark blue beads, and the throat is secured by thong of buckskin [?] with porcupine quills dyed purple. red. [crossed out & yellow] and orange. and terminated with tin cones and whisp of horse hair dyed red.  The bottom of the bag is richly ornamented with beads.  Let us say Just here the work of the              [?genuine?] [?] of a bit of bead work alliged to the indian is proven by the presence or absence of sinew or cotton thread as the means for securing the beads.  The indians in their genuine work use sinew. but when they make to sell to \"white man\" they frequently use thread and when as is some times the case the white man tries his hand at making \"Indian [?]\" he uses thread also.

Coltin in his work seems to have ignored the Ojibway pipe altogether as he has not a single illustration of that indispensable article.  The reason for this may be found in the fact which probably existed at that day: that the Ojibway. not having the \"Cattimite\" are obliged to use other materials. and it appears that only the council pipes are of Stone and they of Slate a harder material to work in.   The other social pipes are carved of wood. the fashion and style of pipes ct out of wood chiefly Maple, \"acer niger\" is endless  A piece of wood is taken and shaped into the proper form. a bowl cut in it and this lined with tin or a piece of brass.  A few of the Ojibway carry pipes of red stone such pipes are prized by them highly but are articles of barter not of domestic manufacture.   The chief Speaker \"mad.we asin.\" at Lac du Flambeau Wisconsin carries a pipe made of \"cattimite\" in the form of a Tomahawk, which is the fabrication of a white man.   \"How have the mighty fallen.\"  The Council Pipe of which we give an illustration is the one belonging to the [?drum?] of the Third Chief of the Lac du Flambeau Band of Ojibway, in Wisconsin   The facts relating to the Ceremonial Drum will be discussed in another chapter.   This pipe is about five inches long made of black slate the body is cylindrical and surmounted by a ridge or tip about a half inch high.   the band is about three inches high of a cylindrical form slightly tapering on the sides of the bowl and about the body are depressing cut which are filled with lead. near the end of the body are three grooves cut.   This pipe the writer made a sketch of as it with the Drum and other sacred articles reclined upon the mat [?needed?] for such things, (This mat is the same as the \"Anakas\" but smaller) in the corner of \"Nanqueb's\" camp.  The Pipe fastened to the stem. reclined on the mat filled to the brim with clean new tobacco. and by its side was a box containing more tobacco.  The reason for all this is this.  The pipe is the special property of Manito. and that it is only loaned to the indians and that they, must keep it full of tobacco at all times and have plenty of tobacco new at hand so that when the Great Spirit desires to smoke he can do so.   In former times the flint and steel were kept close by the pipe now they are replaced by \"the white man's\"

This bag consists of a piece of buckskin doubled up and seamed at the edges. and ornamented by a fringe of buckskin one and one eight inches long.  The bag is open along the outer top and finished by a string of light blue beads secured in loops.  About the edges of the bag is a band of bead work three eights of an inch wide.  the top and bottom stripes are of green beads with dark blue points.  the sides of yellow beads with blue points.  At the tip and bottom are small tassles of tin cone and red horse hair.   Upon the face of the bag is visibly ornamented with porcupine quills dyed a variety of colors.  In two opposite corners is a figure representing the head of a buffalo.  the head and ears are [?] in purple quills the horns in red and white alternately.  In the other corners are now [?] figures which are the likeness of nothing we are acquainted with in the indian country.   In the center is a band of green quills, on either side and of white and an outer one of red, beneath this is a transverse bar. the centre red, and the points green.   The reverse side of the bag is ornamented with their nondescript figures without the heads and have in addition a square patch of white and purple quills in the centre.   The bag is hung round the neck and down at the side by means of a narrow strap wound with red. green, carmine. yellow and purple quills.   The ends of which strap terminate in two tails finished with tin cones.  this bag was worn by \"Dog Home from the War\" in the Ghost Dance held by the Dakotas. and for reason of display rather than utility was made broad.  Vigorous and [?] dancing such as the Ojibway and Dakotas some time engage in would spill all the tobacco from the gaping mouth   However this indian has ceased to dance hence the reason of Mr. Bigerts having the Tobacco bag.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114926,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114926","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3d80cfa47e1acf5b25fb54b366136ff4.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3d80cfa47e1acf5b25fb54b366136ff4.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3d80cfa47e1acf5b25fb54b366136ff4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3d80cfa47e1acf5b25fb54b366136ff4.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:18:55+00:00","modified":"2021-09-08T04:12:44+00:00","filename":"3d80cfa47e1acf5b25fb54b366136ff4.jpg","authentication":"b90395af42d3977f67721adc5edb63b7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00191_o2.jpg","size":1107595,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

made solely for sale in the resorts for tourists in Canada and the \"States.\"  With the Dakota however the percupine quill is in constant demand few articles are there made on which some of these are not to be found.  And they seem to lay great store by them for they are always carried in a pouch  used only for this purpose. as illustrated. it is of an eliptical shape made of a piece of bladder or skin of a length usually about 10\u00bc inches and about 3 3\/4  inches wide.   It is flat and made like an envelope with an upper and lower flap.  The end are finished with triangular pieces of bead nails sewed on the skin with sinew  the beads on this specimen are a ground of yellow with triangles of red and blue. and to finish the ends is the ever present tassle of tin wcenes and here hair the hair in this case is purple.  In such a pouch then the Dakotah squaw carried her stock of colored quills.   Some of the pouches are more elaborately ornamented. the writer has one in which the top flap has a line of beads along the edge but this specimen was selected for illustration for the reason that it was ordered and carried with her into captivity by \"?Crow Kane\" one of the hostile Dakota Squaws who were captured at Pine Ridge Dakota and incarcerated at Fort Sheridan Ill. where this specimen was obtained.  It seems to be singular that so much care should be taken of porcupine quills when the other articles used for ornament are neglected. and it probably grows out of a veneration the native has for this animal the Ojibway  deems it a sacred animal.  And it is possible although we do not know as a matter of fact that the Sioux so consider it.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114927,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114927","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/656859a09acd8813893b4d0a4c2f81d8.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/656859a09acd8813893b4d0a4c2f81d8.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/656859a09acd8813893b4d0a4c2f81d8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/656859a09acd8813893b4d0a4c2f81d8.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:18:57+00:00","modified":"2021-09-08T19:43:00+00:00","filename":"656859a09acd8813893b4d0a4c2f81d8.jpg","authentication":"51560a54f46d88d7c320b481d1be4904","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00192_o2.jpg","size":982955,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2726,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.033387509850275998157798085230751894414424896240234375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["131311"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["131311"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["131311"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["131311"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["131311"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["131311"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"656859a09acd8813893b4d0a4c2f81d8.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324494,"FileSize":982955,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2726\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2726,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:42:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 13:13:11","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 13:13:11","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":75,"SubSecTimeDigitized":75,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"166\n{Three Images]\nOjibway.

The Dakotas method is to secure one end of a strand of sinew and string upon it a number of beads then pass the free end of the sinew through the stuff and again string on beads all the work of the Dakotas that we have ever seen is of that nature. The Ojibway on the other hand while they use the Dakota method most frequently  weave the beads to form their articles of dress and [?]   To weave beads a frame is made of the required size; this frame is a [?] [?] structure [?] top and bottom.  Across the open space are stretched any required number of strands of thread, or sinew. according to the width, or narrowness of the article to be woven.  These strands are simply [?] about the frame.  A second thread is then fastened at one side and on it is taken a bead this thread is then passed over the first strand to the right  hand and carried under the next strand to the left where a second bead is taken up. in this way the beads are put on the thread passing alternately under and over the strands. when the margin is reached the threading is reversed.  In this way all the elaborate piece of bead work such as garters, belts, [four illegible words] are made.

The question has been much disputed whether the \"Cayuse\" is an indigenous horse or a descendent from stock captured from or turned loose by the early Spanish explorers.  we incline to the latter supposition.  However It is a fact that the Dakota raise great numbers of ponies and uses them to carry their bodies and their goods.

The stirrup is a triangular piece of wood covered with raw hide this is illustrated and more fully described under the chapter War & Weapons.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114933,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114933","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/beb976d4d4544edbaaba6feaf65c41c8.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/beb976d4d4544edbaaba6feaf65c41c8.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/beb976d4d4544edbaaba6feaf65c41c8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/beb976d4d4544edbaaba6feaf65c41c8.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:19:05+00:00","modified":"2021-09-10T03:49:37+00:00","filename":"beb976d4d4544edbaaba6feaf65c41c8.jpg","authentication":"808b62585cba8b0f47e4b7ba804ddae5","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00200_o2.jpg","size":998264,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2701,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0342213446323040015872862795731634832918643951416015625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["131456"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["131456"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["131456"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["131456"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["131456"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["131456"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"beb976d4d4544edbaaba6feaf65c41c8.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324495,"FileSize":998264,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2701\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2701,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:43:30","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 13:14:56","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 13:14:56","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":37,"SubSecTimeDigitized":37,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"172\n[Image]\nDakota (Sioux) Quirt.

The lower end of the tine is [?] with a depression into which is fitted a loop of leather which is secured by a rivet.

The Dakota does carry a stuffed skin at times of ceremony but it is rather his sacred animal or bird than his totem in the strict sense.

A favorite game in early day with the Ojibway and all of which they made very good was at one time [?] the game called by the French in Canada \"La Crosse\" by the Ojibway, Bang-ah-ud-o-way.   this is played with a lot of sticks curved at the end and punched with a net made of raw hide.

On one occasion the British lost a fort and the live of many men through a game of La Crosse. It occurred in this way.  The Elgish [sic] held the fort at Mackinaw. in the latter part of the eighteenth century.   The indians had grievances that they were awaiting an opportunity to avenge.  It occurred that the British commandant Major Etheringten. determined upon celebrating the Kings natal day with proper ceremony. and it was agreed by the crafty indians that on that day their young men would play a game of ball out side the fort for the diversion of the white men to this the Major agreed.   The night was spent by the indians in preparing for the capture they sharpened their knives and made everything ready.  In the morning with their weapons concealed under their cloths. they flocked to the fort the women carrying arms and weapons under their blankets took their stand near the gate of the fort.  Upward of a hundred chosen men from each side formed the indian players.  The cannons of the fort had been discharged in salute to the king and the game began   The \"stakes\" were made up.  as the play continued the players moved further and further from the gate of the fort carrying with them in the excitement the white garrison. who stood unarmed  [?] watching the game.   The ball was then gradually carried back toward the open gates and in an instant the ball was thrown within the fort and a rush made to regain it.   And in the fort the play ceased and throwing off their blankets the women produced the weapons and with a \"war whoop\". the indians rushed upon the english ad butchered and scalped them to a man.  The Commendant was captured  The love which the indians had for the french saved them and it is said not a single french man was hurt.  So vigorous is the play that the ball shall it fall in a lake or river. will be followed by the eager sportsmen. who will plunge in and swim for the ball..  This game is now seldom played. by the Ojibway except in Canada where they have match games with the Canadians and half breeds.

The fourth or youngest was \"Cho-kan-in-pok.\" or \"the Man of Flint,\" or the firestone.  When Manibojou grew up he made war upon his brother \"Chokanipok\" because he was as the alleged the cause of his Mother's death.

Origin of the Big Ojibway Drums\"\n\"Some twenty or thirty years ago. among the Dakota tribe of indians an out break arose and on one occassion. of a battle between the United States troops and a band of Dakota Indians. the whole band engaged in this encounter were killed by the troops save one native woman. who saved  herself by wading in the water of a lake and placing a water lillie leaf on her head. which shielded her from the observation of the soldiers.  She remained for four successive days and nights without food.   The cause of her remaining so long in the water was the camp of the soldiers at this spot on the bank of the lake.  On the morning of the fifth day she heard a voice calling to her. in her native tongue and being alarmed she dove out of sight for a moment but on again appearing she observed an old man on the shore with gray flowing beard who told her not to be afraid, but bade her come ashore. which she did.   The old man asked her if she was hungry and she replied she was.  Then he [?] he go to the soldier's camp and have her breakfast and said she must not be alarmed as he would cause her to be invisible so that the soldiers could no see or harm her.  After partaking of her meal the old man again called to her to follow him and bring along with her the wash tub. that she observed. lying in her pathway.  On arriving a short distance from the encampment they halted.   There the old man told her he was the Great Spirit. and that he saw and knew that she was in the water during the four days she was hiding but he could not come to her assistance as he was planning and regulating a religion which he would then relate to her.   Presenting her with a short stick he bade her strike the tub which she did and immediately the tub was transformed into a most beautiful  drum.  (From this circumstance the Ojibway make all their Big Drums out of birch tubs or in lieu thereof a half barrel) and to this day. a tribe cannot make a new drum unless they have authority from this woman","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114977,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114977","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f47f1f3e12db1372337cef5c83cf76fe.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f47f1f3e12db1372337cef5c83cf76fe.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f47f1f3e12db1372337cef5c83cf76fe.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f47f1f3e12db1372337cef5c83cf76fe.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:20:02+00:00","modified":"2021-10-01T04:09:09+00:00","filename":"f47f1f3e12db1372337cef5c83cf76fe.jpg","authentication":"1a6d9762a5423e80c6c62b444dbbf46a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00244_o2.jpg","size":1160813,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2740,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.039227257366855998454990839263700763694941997528076171875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["133214"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["133214"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["133214"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["133214"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["133214"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["133214"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f47f1f3e12db1372337cef5c83cf76fe.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324497,"FileSize":1160813,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2740\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2740,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:46:32","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 13:32:14","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 13:32:14","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":31,"SubSecTimeDigitized":31,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"214\nwho is still young and alive for the Manito ordered it so. and they must have a piece of the original drum. or of a drum that has had a piece descended from the original drum.

This ornament seems to be peculiar to the Dakota stock.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114986,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114986","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/234726622f47020dbecb0f21ab5ea301.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/234726622f47020dbecb0f21ab5ea301.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/234726622f47020dbecb0f21ab5ea301.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/234726622f47020dbecb0f21ab5ea301.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:20:14+00:00","modified":"2021-10-04T15:57:14+00:00","filename":"234726622f47020dbecb0f21ab5ea301.jpg","authentication":"74f43623f6b06c584dcb3021dd929afd","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00253_o2.jpg","size":1152100,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2718,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.039247949200120001156388838126076734624803066253662109375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["133704"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["133704"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["133704"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["133704"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["133704"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["133704"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"234726622f47020dbecb0f21ab5ea301.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324497,"FileSize":1152100,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2718\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2718,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:47:12","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 13:37:04","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 13:37:04","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":31,"SubSecTimeDigitized":31,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"222\n[Two Images]\nOjibway, Dance Collar.

This fruit is used as food and the pits preserved and after being dyed of different colors and drilled at one end with a hole are sed as a substitute for beads. and furnish good material for a necklace.   This necklace is made of four hundred and nine such plum pits secured to a strap. (The drawing does not shew so many because the [?] necessary to get them all in would confuse the picture to an [?] degree.)  The manner of securing them is to perforate the thong of leather at two places and pass through the hides the ends of a short piece of buckskin thong (the size is shown in the enlarged sketch) and to the ends to tie a plum pit.  The strap in the specimen represented is Seventy inches long   The pits themselves are variously colored a majority are of the natural color assumed by a dried pit. a goodly number are dark green. and a few red.

This specimen we procured for purpose of illustration from the [?] Wyman. and are informed that the specimen had originally twelve claws and that the former owner being [?] to part with all of them retained the twelfth claw as a Souvenier.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":114992,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/114992","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b7ec9c9a1f444e683d737beccf60551a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b7ec9c9a1f444e683d737beccf60551a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b7ec9c9a1f444e683d737beccf60551a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b7ec9c9a1f444e683d737beccf60551a.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:20:22+00:00","modified":"2021-10-06T04:10:55+00:00","filename":"b7ec9c9a1f444e683d737beccf60551a.jpg","authentication":"5cc2c26f94502b03af3c5872048bd496","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00259_o2.jpg","size":1079812,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2703,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.036989490415313998339374990109718055464327335357666015625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["133855"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["133855"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["133855"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["133855"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["133855"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["133855"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b7ec9c9a1f444e683d737beccf60551a.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324497,"FileSize":1079812,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2703\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2703,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:47:40","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 13:38:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 13:38:55","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":49,"SubSecTimeDigitized":49,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"229\nDakota Necklace bead\n[Image}\nDakota (Sioux) Necklace bead.

Such a bead most likely took the greater part of a day to make if not more than one.  and it is easy to imagine that the elaboration of such a necklace consumed months.  and such necklace was common only before the advent of the white man.  He brought with him beads ready formed and obtainable with a few. or it might be many pelts..but even then it cost less than to make them. and for this reason the construction of beads of shell and other material died out.  It seems to be an instinct of proclivity stamped upon the human that the costume is not complete without the necklace of beads. almost every human race secure beads of some kind or another.

About the edge of the pouch is a fringe of buckskin. made by cutting the edge of the rear disk into shreads.

In history of man [?] we find a description of his life we find a description of the bracelet as a part of his adornment and the indians are not lacking in this peculiarity and we find the Dakota making for himself and her self a great variety of bracelets of beads. and about any other thing that may be [?].\n\n In the Dakota Armlet or Bracelet we have an illustration of a type. of article worn by the squaws of S. Dakota. at the White River Camp.  It is a band of three strips of raw hide.  Joined at the ends and held in the center. and sides by threads of sinew.  These bands are wound with porcupine quills. dyed. red. gree. and blue the red. predominate and the green. and blue are used to give relief to the color.  The place of union is marked by a tassle of four strips of buckskin wrapped with red porcupine quills and finished with tin cones and brass beads. which tinkle as the wearer moves.  We are often struck with the singular harmony of color which exists in the work of the Dakota indian and are at a loss to explain it.   They use as a rule the complementary colors and the [?] of color is as a rule larger than with the Ojibway yet there is far more conformity to principle and a better result.  Reds are usually associated with green. and yellows with blue. in such a manner that the result is quite brilliant and withal pleasing.  In this bracelet the red and green harmonize well. and the result is good.  The wearing of bracelets is not confined by any means to the Squaws.

The material is black velvet.  Just here let us remark in passing that velvet seems to be a favorite stuff for garments and other articles among the Ojibway. and we incline to the opinion that it is because the velvet has the texture and appearance in a great measure. of a fine fur. the Indian has a fine appreciation of fur. and is prone to use it when ever possible..

When one is sick he is possessed of evil spirits and to rid the patient of them is his care. and he resorts to every known means by noise of drum and cry. to expell the evil one \"to frighten him away\". and we do not understand how if this theory be rue the evil spirit could long remain and listen to the dismal [?] noise made by a Medicine man and his \"tom tom.\"  However the Dakota indian seem to recognize that something beside the cry of he Medicine man and the thunk of his tom tom, and shaking of his rattle. are necessary to cure the sick. and they resort to the process of sweating. which in most cases prove effectual.  The sweat box. or as Rev. Cattin (plate 71. Vol I Collins Eight Year\") calls it.

Two features are correct the fire at which the squaw is heating stones and the water near which the bath is set up.  all the rest is the work of imagination.   We cannot refrain from asking right  here \"why cannot the [?] on indian subjects stick to the truth. it is Just as fascinating as the falsehood:  In the Cattin picture a large teepee is set up and inside is an indian crouching in a cage (probably made of wood) though it would be equally as correct if made of iron. or brass.) set upon pillars of stones piled one upon the other leaving a large space beneath the floor of the cage and the earth the floor of the cage seems perfectly flat and it is likely that is [?] made of a [?] of flat stone.

The fact is that when it is deemed proper to give a patient a sweat bath. for any reason and we would say in summer  they indulge in them from [?]  A \"wikiup\". is made very low. and Just large enough to contain the party taking the bath.   It is made of willow or other saplings thrust in the ground. the ends arching over and being tied..  Over this frame is spread blankets and robes to enclose it    In the centre is a small hole in which when they are heated the attendant squaw puts some stones and on them is thrown water. as many indians as can huddle into this \"wikiup\" do so.  they are all nude and when the cage is full so to speak the cover is let down. and the occupants. are immersed in a bath of hot vapor. which they submit to till they are [?] with persperation and every pour [sic] is open. when they throw off the cover and plunge into the ajoining  water. which in the case of a patient kills or cures.

It is stated on good authority that when a Dakota has become so ill that the herbs and combined howl of the squaws of the lodge and village fail to drive out the evil spirit the medecine [sic] man is sent for. for this purpose a swift runner is selected as a messenger and he proceeds with a present to the lodge of he medecine man enters it and states the object of his visit and deposits the present. he then roughly Jostles the medecine man with his foot and and starts off at a run for the lodge of the sick man followed by the medecine man. if the latter can over take the messenger and kick him he goes no further. if not he follows to the lodge of the sick man and is bound to heal him if he is able.  Colonel Dodge states that the Medecine man is paid only in case the patient recovers.. Our experience has been that nothing is gotten from an indian without pay. first and with no contingencies.  The medecine man is a thing of spontaneous growth. the office is not one of heredity but is acquired and granted by common consent. any one may aspire to the dignity. and each has an equal chance to maintain the right to the office.  From time to time the aspirant proclaims that he has made medecine which is potent. and will effect the cure he claims for it. He is put to the test and must expose himself to the greatest danger and the most trying circumstances to put his \"Medecine\" to the trial. if injury befall him his medecine is \"not good\" and he fails. if he succeed he is given confidence.  The  Late \"Sitting Bull\" was a medecine man of experience and was at the same time a chief which circumstances made him a very influential personage among his people.  He at the same time being turbulent and cross grained excited the Dakota to incessant attacks and incursions upon the whites and since his death there has been peace.

But we would just say that the \"Phthisis\" or \"consumption\" is a disease of civilization and unknown to the indian in his normal aboriginal condition.  It is only when the wild animal: indian. is taken from his teepee and cooped up in a house made by the white man which is air tight. in a measure. and in which the indian several families deep some times. lie huddled together that the disease makes its appearance.  The houses made for the indian are totally unfit for their occupancy from the fact that they admit of no ventillation.

Haupt coll. (& .del.)\nActual size.\nIn the domain of Surgery the Ojibway does little. and has very few appliances. in fact none in the strict sense. but we feel that we must admit the \"Medecine bone\" to a place under the head of surgery as it is a mechanical means for producing a medicinal effect.  The medecine bone is a long hollow bone of a crane or other bird.  cut about two and three eigth inches in length. the edges smoothed down by rubbing them on a stone or file.  This bone is the last resort of the medecine man when he wishes to produce emesis and every other method has failed.  this bone is swallowed by he patient and is it said always produces its effect.  Mr Beauleau tells the writer that four were usually swallowed. but we had never found more than one in the possession of any one Medecine Man.  The rationale of the cause of the effect upon the system is difficult to conceive unless we admit it to be strictly mechanical.  To the white man with less indifferent [?nerves?] than the indian. the idea that the bone had been formerly applied for so many similar purposes might produce emesis through the operation of the emotions.  The same  bone is used as an aspirater to remove pus from a sore. when occasion requires the medecine man or his acolyte creating a vaccuum at one end of the bone with his lips and mouth.\n\n   Being [?] to see this for [?] \"Medecine Bone\" we made constant inquiry and search for it among the different band of indians visited at length in one of our visits we heard through a friendly squaw of such a bone in the village. and by her efforts were able to get it to make a drawing from. and doing so expressed a strong desire to possess it. finally through the kind offices of our friendly squaw the squaw a [?] woman who owned it agreed to let us keep the bone if we would make a photograph of herself and daughter. to this we agreed and the bone was delivered. but with the express understanding that it should not be known that she had parted with it. or her husband would kill her.\"  It has been kept a secret from the tribe. and we presume the squaws life is still

They say that a great many years ago. way back in the early days. on the spot where they dig the\n\nstone they were once attacked by thousands and thousands of their enemies the Ojibway (Chippewa) indians living to the north. and that a most desperate fight was he result it was very sanguinary and all the Ojibway were killed.  Their blood coagulated and hardened and there were so many killed the hardened blood forms the present stratum of rock.  This is why the stone is sacred to them as it is the blood of their enemies.\n\n One old Indian told Mr. George Cattin taking a piece of the stone and comparing its color with that of his arm that the stone was the hardened flesh of the indian hence it was sacred.   The Dakotas who dominate the pipe stone region. became very much exasperated because a trader made from the pipe stone a \"dish.\" to eat from.   They hold that if the stone is used for any other purpose than to make pipes it is desecrated. and it is bad medecine to the tribe.'\n  The dances of the Dakota tribes are now fewer than they were at the opening of  this century. and it would seem that they do not [?] like the Ojibway the regular [?] ceremonial dances that descend from generation to generation.   the ceremonial [?] through in olden times in the act of imitating a brave. and the \"Sun Dance\" have both practically fallen into disuse.   In their place the \"Ghost Dance.\" a modern invention that was resorted to in 1890 at Pine Ridge S. Dakota to arouse the anger and hatred of the indians against the whites and led to an outbreak. in which many were killed.   The \"Sun dance\" is one which is not uncommon in a very harmless and dwarfed condition    In former times the dance consisted in. the formation of a large lodge. in the center of which was an opening and suspended from the roof was the \"effigi\" of the \"Sun God.\"   in the middle of the lodge was a ring roped off.  A council having met the number of days the dance should last was determined..and the dance opened. by the placing of the musicians (drummers) at one side.  the drumming and chant commenced and from the assembled crowd one and another indian stepped into the ring and began to dance.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":115057,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/115057","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7e0056b82412601bfedd05de76702379.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7e0056b82412601bfedd05de76702379.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7e0056b82412601bfedd05de76702379.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7e0056b82412601bfedd05de76702379.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:21:48+00:00","modified":"2021-11-02T04:03:06+00:00","filename":"7e0056b82412601bfedd05de76702379.jpg","authentication":"b4fdd9e2ae8e8cd06c0268cacceaa4e7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00327_o2.jpg","size":1389148,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2746,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0468407919937419980893622550865984521806240081787109375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["141024"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["141024"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["141024"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["141024"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120510"],"TimeCreated":["141024"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120510"],"DigitalCreationTime":["141024"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7e0056b82412601bfedd05de76702379.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324501,"FileSize":1389148,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2746\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2746,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.7 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:05:16 09:52:34","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:10 14:10:24","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:10 14:10:24","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":31,"SubSecTimeDigitized":31,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"287\nkeeping time with the music and having his eye fastened on the \"sun.\"  he could not take them away..he must held his head up.   the dancer carried a whistle made of bone. which they held in their mouth. and blew constantly   Once in the [?] the dancer might not leave it till the dance ended or he was carried out in a faint by his friends looking on. or as the case sometimes was 'dead'.

The ceremony and dances which it has been our privilege to witness have been quite staid and stately.   The old time-bound customs many of them prevail today.  and are practiced with great ceremony.  The advent of a stranger to the village is heralded with marks of stoical indifference. and always with suspicion the ice is never broken til a council has been held and the purpose of the visit of the new commer [sic] ascertained as far as may be.  if the object is a laudable one well and good if not he soon discovers that \"his [?room?] is better than his company\".  In an incredibly short time the presence of a stranger will be made known to every wigwam in the village and a council summoned to take action on his presence.   The [?writer visited?]  the Ojibway in [?Wisconsin?] in the time of sugar making for the purpose of seeing how it was done by the indian. and till the chief \"Nausquelo\" satisfied himself that it was all right he was very cold and distant.

In another place we have described the council pipe and [?] box held by \"Nanoquels\"  \"Sun that occurred at mid day.\"  and in the [?] drawing we show a Tobacco Tray. and flint bowl of the old \"Regens\".  This is a tray made of maple as is also the bowl.  The dimensions are given from memory. the original notes being destroyed with the former MSS.  The tray is of a rectangular outline. on top the sides sloping toward the bottom which is rectangular but smaller.  In the centre is an oval pit in which the tobacco is place. the margin or rim being broad. and preventing loss of tobacco.   The \"flint bowl.\" is smaller of a [?conical?] form with a flat bottom.

As soon as he begins to totter about, he carries - as a plaything - a miniature bow & arrow.  The first thing he is taught as great & truly noble is taking a scalp, and he pants to perform an act which is so manly.   At the age of sixteen he is often on the war path.   When a boy is of the proper age to go to war, he is presented with p, or he makes a war club.   He then consecrates certain parts of animals, which he vows not to eat.  after he had killed an enemy he is at liberty to eat any one of those portions of an animal from which he agreed to abstain.  If he kills another person the prohibition is taken off from another part, until finally he has been emancipated from his oath by his bravery.   Before young men go out on a war party, they endeavor to propitiate the patron deity by a feast.   During the hours of night they celebrate the \"armor feast\" which is distinguished by drumming, singing, and agonized shrieking. much in the same way as the Knights of old [?watched?] their armor before the day of trial.\n\n  The war prophets, or priests, by the narrating of pretended dreams or by inspiring oratory, incite the tribe against an enemy.  If a party are successful in securing scalps, they paint themselves black and return home in mad-triumph.   As they approach their village, those who are there run forth to greet them and strip them of their clothes and supply them with others.   The scalp is very carefully prepared for exhibition being painted red and stretched upon a hoop which is fastened to a pole: If the scalp is from a man it is decked with an eagle feather, if from a woman with a comb.   At a scalp dance at Kaposia Minnesota the braves stood on one side of the circle, drumming & rattling and shouting a monotonous song, reminding one of a ditty of the chimney sweeps of a city.  The women standing opposite to the men, advanced & retreated from them squeaking in an unearthly manner a sort of chorus  This is the chief dance in which the women engage.  If a scalp is taken in summer they dance until the falling of the leaves; if taken in winter, until the hares appear.   When the scalp is freshly painted, as it is four times, it is a great occasion.  After their mad orgies have ceased, they burn or bury it.\n An Eagle's feather with a red spot on the head of an Indian is a badge that the possessor has  killed a foe.   If the feather is notched and bordered with red or dipped and topped with red, it signifies that a throat has been cut.  The red on a blanket shows that the woman has been wounded by an enemy; but the black hand, that he has killed his enemy.  The Dakotas like other savages in war, show no sympathy for sex, infancy or old age.

Mr. Riggs narrates an insident [sic] of some of the upper bands of Dakotas pursuing a weak Ojibay mother.  To save her life she swam a stream.  Half naked she reached the opposite bank and dropped down to much exhausted to attempt to proceed.   With the delight of demons just let loose from hell, her pursuers came over, stabbed and scalped her.  Prematurely ushering into existence her unborn babe they dashed its brains out upon the ground.  Returning with the mother's scalp, they came home as \"conquering heroes come,\" and were received with pride & honors.  Such is savage warfare, and such is the savage idea of true glory.  But, notwithstanding their horrid mode of warfare, they are not destitute of affection for their own offspring or friends.\"  Hennepin relates that the Dakotas at Lake Pepin seeing a frenchman shoot a wild turkey with a gun they called the [?\"Manza Ouachange\"?] \"iron that has understanding.\" or more correctly \"Maza Wakando\" \"this is the [?] metal.\"\n\n  Spring and Summer was the time for war.  In former days the Dakota and Ojibway met together in bands upon the common hunting grounds during the long northern winter and lived in the same villages. and even intermarried. but as soon as spring came broke up their camps. and returned to the permanent villages, and the parties had hardly separated before they retraced their steps and attacked each the other to kill and take scalps. after killing a relative or one who had been united by marriage to them. as it was the custom when the camp broke up for the families to separate and the husband and wife go with their tribe.\n  The belief of the indians was that to scalp an enemy subjected the soul to eternal torment in the world beyond. and if the body was mutilated it had the same effect.

When it was possible a Dakota procured a piece of iron be it an old wagon tire or any thing else. that would apply this was rubbed on stones and in other ways fashioned into a spear point. and secured to a shaft made a spear.  The spear from the Cache collection has a point about nine inches long and one and a half inches wide this is secured to a handle six feet or so long. by means of sinew which is wrapped about the end of the shaft and over this is a piece of buckskin, the end of the shaft is also as we recall it finished in a like manner.  extending the entire length of the shaft is a strip of blue flannel to which is sewed Eagles feathers.

It frequently happened that they had to follow the trail for some days before they came up with the herd.  so soon as the buffalo were sighted the hunters would set off.   Among the ponies owned by the indians certain of them were especially used to hunt buffalo. and in proceeding to the hunt these ponies were led while the owner rode another when the chase commenced he dismounted and mounted his buffalo ponies and with spear in hand bow and arrows if he had them strapped on his back he rode into the hunt. when all was ready with a shout of the war cry the hunter dashed upon the afrighted buffalo and rushing from one to another shot them through or thrust them with this spear thus disabeling [sic] them and these were dispatched subsequently by the slower riders and the squaws.

Such [?] whistles do not at  present exist at all.\n  The time honored Bow and arrow is still in constant use with the indians of Dakota and Ojibway [?]  The metal and stone point is now obsolite [sic] with the Ojibway in a great measure.

From the Pacific coast we get arrow points made of agate for shooting birds that are really beautiful they are sometimes only one inch in length but most beautifully chipped and beveled \n\n  The arrow points. employed by the Ojibway past and present by present we mean those of this century seem to be included in three classes the types of which we give as taken from the valuable collection of Dr. Phillips.  The upper specimen is the form used for killing small game, and birds.   This is made of a [?mottled?] chirt chiefly of a white or light gray color.   The point is good and the rear end cut square with no barb, the thickness if five sixteenths of an inch. the height two and three eight inches and the width one inch.  this specimen is from. Jackson Illinois\n  The writer in August 1892 on the [?South?] west shore of Lake Beulah. Wisconsin. a point of similar construction as to outline but much smaller and more regular.  the edges more delicately chipped and the square edge very sharp.  This specimen. was about. one and five eights inches long. five eight of an inch wide and three sixteenth of an inch thick.  This is also of white chert. and was no doubt used as a knife the point driven into a handle and the Square edge used as a cutter.\n  The second specimen in the Phillips collection is th form of arrow point used in wars it has a shank which the others did not. and is barbed..  The shank it will be noted is of such form that to it might be fastened the shaft of the arrow to direct the point. but when the head and barbs had once entered the body any attempt to withdraw the arrow would detach the head leaving it to fester in the wound. so that should the warrior succeed in imbedding his arrow in his enemy he might go back to his wigwam with a satisfied mind feeling sure that sooner or later his enemy must succumb to his shot.   This specimen is from Grand River [?Lock?] Fox River in Wisconsin and is of uniform gray chirt and is well formed.. the length is two and three quarter inches the width, one and five eights inches and the thickness one quarter of an inch..\n  The third specimen is the type of arrow head used for the killing of large game this form is barbed and has a flared shank. intended to prevent the shaft becoming detached. shot with sufficient force the head entered the body and the shaft protruded. and remained an integral part of the arrow when the animal fell.  the arrow was recovered usually intact.

Such could not be the method.  the \"coppers\" were forged cold or hot as we think we can show..   In 1864, \"Pierre Boucher.\" a Canadian. published a work. in Paris. in which he in describing Lake Superior and the surrounding country says. \"that the french men who returned to Montreal, being the remnants of the Jesuits expedition under Father Menard says, \"They told me they had seen a nugget of copper. at the end of a hill, which weighed more than eight hundred pounds. and this the indians as they pass it. make fires on top of it. and then hew pieces out of it. with their axes.\" (Minnesota Historical Collections.

When we are seeking for facts it is hardly Just to Jump at conclusions. or. advance theories that are in reality only theories.   Copper melts. at 2500\u00ba degrees and such a degree of heat cannot be attained in an open fire. it can be attained only by a blast. and that we are certain the indians never had. we find no indication of such a apparatus. in any mound. or picture nor in the descriptions of any early writer on the subject.  it is strange that if any thing like the complicated devices necessary to smelt copper were in use by the indians at any time. they had failed to attract the notice of the early writers.. and that the indians should have no traditions of any thing of the kind.  It is very possible for the indian to make a fire and soften the nugget of copper but he never melted it.  In fact we think it shows superior skill to be able to forge from the cold copper, upon a stone anvil, and with a rock hammer the beautiful specimens. of \"copper\" that are found. throughout that region of country.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":115093,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/115093","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/181f9521e8843991d6bf0ce4b1ea93b7.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/181f9521e8843991d6bf0ce4b1ea93b7.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/181f9521e8843991d6bf0ce4b1ea93b7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/181f9521e8843991d6bf0ce4b1ea93b7.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:22:34+00:00","modified":"2021-11-25T03:52:46+00:00","filename":"181f9521e8843991d6bf0ce4b1ea93b7.jpg","authentication":"33f431372c75985f6ec74672578044aa","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00364_o2.jpg","size":889241,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2705,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.030438864927773999491389389504547580145299434661865234375},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"181f9521e8843991d6bf0ce4b1ea93b7.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324503,"FileSize":889241,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2705\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2705,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0},"IFD0":{"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:05:24 06:06:24"},"EXIF":{"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2294,"ExifImageLength":3053}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"319 [Three Images]\nDakota (Sioux) War Club.

The handle or shaft is a piece of [?] [?]. the end of which enters the pit in the head and \"[?]\" of the [?] is carried round the head fitting in the groove in the stone. the [?] and handle are bound with sinew. and over all is sewed with sinew or pairs of green raw hide. which when it dries binds the whole together as firmly as a rock.  The Mandan indians. made a war club by taking a rounded stone of the required size and covering the entire head in raw hide.   The end upper end of the raw hide of the handle is [?] and to this is attached the ornaments.   This consists of a \"rosette\" of feathers\" . in the center of which is a tassle of white wool as additional ornament is put a loop of raw hide wrapped with read. blue. and yellow. porcupine Quills.   To hang it by a buckskin loop is attached to the end of the raw hide.  In a contemporary work written by a gentleman who certainly knows whereof he speaks. is a picture of an impliment [sic] of stone covered with raw hide and having a short handle. which is described as a \"Sioux War Club,\" it is in reality a picture of a \"pemican pounder\".  and the only war in which such a short range weapon could be used is the domestic war in a teepee.  The author most likely did not [?] the subject or such an inexcusable error had not been put in. \u2609\n\n  In the war among themselves and with other indians Natives a war club armed with steel or iron blades was used.   In the Cooks Collection is one with a revolver handle made of tough wood. and armed with two steel knife blades. projecting about six inches. from the body of the club..  such a weapon would make a dangerous thing in the hands of an infuriated inidian and such they in reality were.  Other forms of the war club exist some with a blade projecting from [?] cut on the end of the club.\n\n\u2609This war club was one that belonged to one of Sitting Bulls. band. and was taken with him when they were captured a few years ago and now at Fort Randall. as \"Prisoners of war\".","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":115095,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/115095","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/6f684126b497a804d35f4ee320d28198.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/6f684126b497a804d35f4ee320d28198.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/6f684126b497a804d35f4ee320d28198.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6f684126b497a804d35f4ee320d28198.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:22:37+00:00","modified":"2021-11-27T03:30:21+00:00","filename":"6f684126b497a804d35f4ee320d28198.jpg","authentication":"61f005e837b8d4db61fef0833b3e7360","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_366_FL001_00366_o2.jpg","size":1008762,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2702,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.03456842667982600036946649879610049538314342498779296875},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6f684126b497a804d35f4ee320d28198.jpg","FileDateTime":1606324503,"FileSize":1008762,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2702\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2702,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0},"IFD0":{"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:05:24 06:06:25"},"EXIF":{"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2293,"ExifImageLength":3054}}}},"item":{"id":1358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1358","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"321\n[Two Images]\nOjibwaay.

It would seem that the statement  of their being stones is apt to lead to the most erroneous conclusion.  We have not in any of the collections of our friends or the musiums [sic] seen any of these stones. hence we doubt their existance.[sic] but we have seen and have collected pieces of wood of various sizes and shapes. although the usual in fact typical. is that of a short paddle. a broad end to mark on and a pointed end to stick in the ground. and such pieces of wood with the Totem. and other marks. as the case may be engraved on it.

Just here we would say that substantiating Mr. Schoolcrafts statement we have found on all the Burial tablets examined the head of the animal in the totem is inverted. a sign of the death of the owner thereof.  In answer to the question. What do the marks on the \"Totem sticks\" or Burial tablets mean? we obtained the following explanation.. \"You know the indian relies upon his medicine a great deal and an indian is [?].  Just for his medecine. and so he ranks with his tribe.. They believe that an indian can kill another with medecine.    (The medecine as the indian applies it is not of necessity the medical application of the white physician uses it. but a patent Spiritual subtle influence by means of which they can. produce effects at a distance and at any time)   The marks on the sticks are the figures of men and women [?] they are to show how many indians the deceased has killed or been accused of killing.  The straight marks are some great deed done such as some great medecine work. You will find such marks on the totem sticks of children..  A great thing or act of bravery done by the head of a family is honored. and kept for generations after hence the children have marks of their elders\"   When an Ojibway dies the medecine man and the family stay all night at the wigwam and dance. and the chief speaker makes a speech ulogizing [sic] the dead. and they sing songs to the Manito in behalf of the defeated and in the morning they carry him out with with ceremony to the grave. and bury him.

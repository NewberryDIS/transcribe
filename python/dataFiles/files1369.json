They stated that they had been at war with the Texians for several years, and were tired of hostilities, and would long since have sent in a flag of truce to our settlers, but were fearful that they would be shot down.  Mr. Logan further states, that they desire that Gen. Houston should designate a time and place to meet them, to form a treaty of peace. - They say that all the tribes of Texas, except a few renegade Cherokees, will send deputies to meet him at any place on the frontier that he may designate, and tey think all the tribes residing on our borders, will readily join in concluding the treat. - [Telegraph.\n\nSantanas proposition for an Armistice or peace\u00a0! -\nUnder 26th March [?] obs. is found on Texan fleet & its operation at leaving New Orleans for Yucatan.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":116404,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/116404","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ed491a75e7619494d3a0512b11a0c92a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ed491a75e7619494d3a0512b11a0c92a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ed491a75e7619494d3a0512b11a0c92a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ed491a75e7619494d3a0512b11a0c92a.jpg"},"added":"2021-01-15T14:15:39+00:00","modified":"2021-02-02T05:17:37+00:00","filename":"ed491a75e7619494d3a0512b11a0c92a.jpg","authentication":"ad53221543937929dbef0461d3519151","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_83e_VL06_00045_o2.jpg","size":1312292,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5D Mark II, software=Adobe Photoshop CS5 Macintosh, datetime=2012:","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2920,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0416125063419584},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120606"],"TimeCreated":["134426+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120606"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120606"],"TimeCreated":["134426+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120606"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120606"],"TimeCreated":["134426+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120606"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ed491a75e7619494d3a0512b11a0c92a.jpg","FileDateTime":1610720072,"FileSize":1312292,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2920\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2920,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:06:27 09:50:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666666666,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:06 13:44:26","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:06 13:44:26","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":40,"SubSecTimeDigitized":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1759,"ExifImageLength":2168,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965045,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.141962421712,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1369,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1369","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"[?] Journal 26th March.

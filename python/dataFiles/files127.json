Indeed I do not think I shall study much this winter only enough to fix the lectures in my mind. I have been taking it pretty easy since coming down and have got fairly rested at last. Indeed am feeling much better, quite well. \nI am sorry Tommie's side is no better. I think it would be well for him to take aconite at night and rhus. or arnica in the morning. He might take acon night and morning for a few days. I am very sorry indeed to hear of David's illness. I hope he will yet get better. I suppose acon would do him good, but probably they would not wish to give him anything aside from the Drs. prescriptions. How does Mrs. Thomas get along. Have you given her that little bottle yet?

Jan 23, 1890\nDear Sister:\nSaturday has again come & with it the prospect of sending a letter to you. Our calender says that it is a month since Christmas, but we can hardly realize it. Our cold snap of the first of the week, has given way to warm cloudy weather, leaving ice and mud, after our nice carpet of snow. These weekly storms remind me of our [?] experience, of storm every Saturday, with roads blocked up for Sunday, as it used to be sometimes for several weeks in succession. Lewis used to say, that there would be sometimes a cycle of three weeks, of similar weather & occasionally it would double, and be six weeks,   we have had four weeks, so perhaps\n\"grain rent\" that is one third of the crop and supply everything as John rented one half, and he supply horses, farm implements [&c?].   Something in that way it goes, varying as to whether the grain is housed or left in the field. I wish it could be that Robbie & family were coming out here. If he still has it in mind, his way would be to write to John or Edward or both & see what they would say. There are chances for school teaching here.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":30579,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/30579","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/5cf629fafd53eea6a944857e6f10476d.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/5cf629fafd53eea6a944857e6f10476d.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/5cf629fafd53eea6a944857e6f10476d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5cf629fafd53eea6a944857e6f10476d.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-09T15:58:00+00:00","modified":"2020-03-28T07:06:47+00:00","filename":"5cf629fafd53eea6a944857e6f10476d.jpg","authentication":"935f81a3ee1c74592539ea9bf949efc4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_06_fl_199_030_02_o2.jpg","size":1029576,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2334,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040844520613158},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["015237"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160217"],"DigitalCreationTime":["015237"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["015237"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160217"],"DigitalCreationTime":["015237"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["015237"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160217"],"DigitalCreationTime":["015237"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5cf629fafd53eea6a944857e6f10476d.jpg","FileDateTime":1507564345,"FileSize":1029576,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2334\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2334,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:06:20 10:18:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:17 01:52:37","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:17 01:52:37","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":18,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":127,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/127","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"we will have two more, and then there may be a change.

Where John Shafer and Mr. Barnard are buried. Mr. B. died a year ago of pneumonia. He was an old setler and perhaps you remember he told us, that John's house was the first at which they stayed in Kansas. He called here several times when we were strangers here and was the first Kansasian who manifested any interest in us. His son Horace was a great friend of Franks's. He left one other son, Addison, both married, and their mother who has long suffered with a tumor on her neck. We never have seen her but John has her likeness\nJay's age and a smaller one. Mrs. Reynold's family consists of two sons and a married daughter, mother of a 4 yr old lad.

It rained a good deal on the way home & we were glad of the shelter.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":30603,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/30603","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/6f8d4cd83209fe025176530151b7e4d5.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/6f8d4cd83209fe025176530151b7e4d5.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/6f8d4cd83209fe025176530151b7e4d5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6f8d4cd83209fe025176530151b7e4d5.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-09T15:59:01+00:00","modified":"2020-03-28T21:48:09+00:00","filename":"6f8d4cd83209fe025176530151b7e4d5.jpg","authentication":"4fc49d735d2ddbb97f431ff240e6ff4d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_06_fl_199_035_04_o2.jpg","size":1037594,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2274,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042248688882374},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["015407"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160217"],"DigitalCreationTime":["015407"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["015407"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160217"],"DigitalCreationTime":["015407"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["015407"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160217"],"DigitalCreationTime":["015407"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6f8d4cd83209fe025176530151b7e4d5.jpg","FileDateTime":1507564346,"FileSize":1037594,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2274\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2274,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:06:20 10:30:14","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:17 01:54:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:17 01:54:07","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":127,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/127","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"We are sorry to know that Laura & Carrie are so feeble.

We both went to the Baptist church in the evening\nWe looked over the books in the study yesterday putting those with Eddie's name one side. Who is the owner of Thackery's works. There is not name in it. Am glad you like the new sweeper. Did you get it of Mr. Ross at Merrill? Give my love to the good friends. I am glad you are gaining in strength I have not been lonely at all. Have enjoyed it. The sun shines brightly today We sleep in large room up stairs. Mary on west side , while I take the east.

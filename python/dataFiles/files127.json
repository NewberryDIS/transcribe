I have been pretty busy the last week, and have been too careful of myself to write evenings. I usually retire as early as eight or nine. do not study at all evenings. Indeed I do not think I shall study much this winter only enough to fix the lectures in my mind. I have been taking it pretty easy since coming down and have got fairly rested at last. Indeed am feeling much better, quite well. \nI am sorry Tommie's side is no better. I think it would be well for him to take aconite at night and rhus. or arnica in the morning. He might take acon night and morning for a few days. I am very sorry indeed to hear of David's illness. I hope he will yet get better. I suppose acon would do him good, but probably they would not wish to give him anything aside from the Drs. prescriptions. How does Mrs. Thomas get along. Have you given her that little bottle yet?

Jan 23, 1890\nDear Sister:\nSaturday has again come & with it the prospect of sending a letter to you. Our calender says that it is a month since Christmas, but we can hardly realize it. Our cold snap of the first of the week, has given way to warm cloudy weather, leaving ice and mud, after our nice carpet of snow. These weekly storms remind me of our Steuben experience, of storm every Saturday, with roads blocked up for Sunday, as it used to be sometimes for several weeks in succession. Lewis used to say, that there would be sometimes a cycle of three weeks, of similar weather & occasionally it would double, and be six weeks,   we have had four weeks, so perhaps\n\"grain rent\" that is one third of the crop and supply everything as John rented one half, and he supply horses, farm implements &c.   Something in that way it goes, varying as to whether the grain is housed or left in the field. I wish it could be that Robbie & family were coming out here. If he still has it in mind, his way would be to write to John or Edward or both & see what they would say. There are chances for school teaching here.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":30579,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/30579","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5cf629fafd53eea6a944857e6f10476d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5cf629fafd53eea6a944857e6f10476d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5cf629fafd53eea6a944857e6f10476d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5cf629fafd53eea6a944857e6f10476d.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-09T15:58:00+00:00","modified":"2020-09-14T20:48:58+00:00","filename":"5cf629fafd53eea6a944857e6f10476d.jpg","authentication":"935f81a3ee1c74592539ea9bf949efc4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_06_fl_199_030_02_o2.jpg","size":1029576,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2334,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040844520613157998811804105798728414811193943023681640625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["015237"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160217"],"DigitalCreationTime":["015237"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["015237"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160217"],"DigitalCreationTime":["015237"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["015237"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160217"],"DigitalCreationTime":["015237"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5cf629fafd53eea6a944857e6f10476d.jpg","FileDateTime":1507564345,"FileSize":1029576,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2334\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2334,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:06:20 10:18:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:17 01:52:37","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:17 01:52:37","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":18,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":127,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/127","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"we will have two more, and then there may be a change.

We did not send very much in the box, a few cans of fruit, some stock, a pair of shoes of Jennie's for you. They are pretty worn and so soft.

City the next day starting before daylight too meet the 7 A.M. train & returning on the 7 P.M. that evening, both local freight & pretty rough traveling. Wednesday it snowed about 5 to 6 inches & Thursday it drizzled as they started & then rained all day, making the trip a pretty hard one, John was very tired but was somewhat rested when we started last evening.

Your sister Mary.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":30682,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/30682","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f11cb49d3af7a3bb0ae0d0ae7fdb3317.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f11cb49d3af7a3bb0ae0d0ae7fdb3317.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f11cb49d3af7a3bb0ae0d0ae7fdb3317.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f11cb49d3af7a3bb0ae0d0ae7fdb3317.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-09T16:02:03+00:00","modified":"2020-05-04T17:20:33+00:00","filename":"f11cb49d3af7a3bb0ae0d0ae7fdb3317.jpg","authentication":"3ae5e02979286b5441cd5584ced31317","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_06_fl_199_055_04_o2.jpg","size":793272,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2270,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.032357317670092998473929668534765369258821010589599609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["015842"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160217"],"DigitalCreationTime":["015842"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["015842"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160217"],"DigitalCreationTime":["015842"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["015842"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160217"],"DigitalCreationTime":["015842"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f11cb49d3af7a3bb0ae0d0ae7fdb3317.jpg","FileDateTime":1507564350,"FileSize":793272,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2270\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2270,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:06:20 10:44:38","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:17 01:58:42","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:17 01:58:42","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":127,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/127","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Have just discovered a swelling under the left lower jaw a little in front of ear.

He preached a beautiful sermon this morning from the text, \"He that hath this hope in him, purifieth himself even as he is pure.\" \nSubject the power or mission of Christ to save from present sin as well as from its consequences & punishment.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":30708,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/30708","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/fffabf042f49478177eb7a10ec869cff.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/fffabf042f49478177eb7a10ec869cff.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/fffabf042f49478177eb7a10ec869cff.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fffabf042f49478177eb7a10ec869cff.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-09T16:03:11+00:00","modified":"2020-05-05T05:02:09+00:00","filename":"fffabf042f49478177eb7a10ec869cff.jpg","authentication":"4d3e8bdba01fcaded613c0e6c10618ee","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_06_fl_199_059_06_o2.jpg","size":975056,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2334,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.038681646513693997146976499834636342711746692657470703125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["020028"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["020028"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["020028"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"fffabf042f49478177eb7a10ec869cff.jpg","FileDateTime":1507564350,"FileSize":975056,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2334\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2334,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"10mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:02:18 16:50:30","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:17 02:00:28","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:17 02:00:28","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":57,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1621,"ExifImageLength":2500,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":127,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/127","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"$.5. came all safe.

If you get the widest the same width as this and I guess you had better double it a little to go around the crown as this is a little shallower than the other These flats full of love from Mary","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":30720,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/30720","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/bb551317355f33383608fdf784db63b0.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/bb551317355f33383608fdf784db63b0.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/bb551317355f33383608fdf784db63b0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/bb551317355f33383608fdf784db63b0.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-09T16:03:41+00:00","modified":"2020-01-17T22:53:45+00:00","filename":"bb551317355f33383608fdf784db63b0.jpg","authentication":"fbbf315b90736f5ca95a5c53b6137ef2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_06_fl_200_002_02_o2.jpg","size":1036208,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2278,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042118167333268001495394372568625840358436107635498046875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["020305"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["020305"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["020305"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"bb551317355f33383608fdf784db63b0.jpg","FileDateTime":1507564351,"FileSize":1036208,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2278\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2278,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"10mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:02:18 16:51:21","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:17 02:03:05","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:17 02:03:05","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":86,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1600,"ExifImageLength":2528,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":127,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/127","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Sending you there!

What a host of questions. You will perhaps say, well there is not one to which I do not wish I had to answer. I expect you will have a nice visit with Jennie and Anna. They left us yesterday intending to be with you tomorrow. Do not visit too hard, but enjoy it as much as you can. Jennie has been quite poorly this vacation, we hoped the trip would do her good, and I know Sarah will be delighted with a visit from Anna. My head is much better than when I last wrote and as Sarah would say, I must mark the hours that shine. I try to, and feel happy today. The house is very still only minestrone home today.

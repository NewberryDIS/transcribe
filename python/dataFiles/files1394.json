Moore Business Mgr.\n\nM.M. MOORE\nPhoto Pillow Tops\nGlen Ellyn, ILL.\nMay 4, 1921.\nDearest Mum & Grandmum:\nTunsilu Moore is not yet with us in person. Each day I have looked forward to as a possible family birthday, but not so. I only hope he (she) will not put it off so long that I can't have Mrs. Lang. She expects to be called by another patient on or near the 15th of May, so in case the other lady is on time, I may only have her help for a few days. I probably can get someone who will do as well to finish out with, though, and the first few days are the most important. \n\n  Keep forgetting to tell you that about three weeks ago, on a Sunday, Helen and Herman, with the children, also Helen's father, stopped outside in the auto for a few minutes to say Hello. Helen came in for a short interval - long enough to go the bathroom. Uncle Geo. leaned forth from the car and said: \"Where is your mother, K?\" Then - \"Give her my love when you write.\" He is all smooth shaven, now, and","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":120200,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/120200","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3bfdb37c5bb726dc8301d6ae19c03072.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3bfdb37c5bb726dc8301d6ae19c03072.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3bfdb37c5bb726dc8301d6ae19c03072.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3bfdb37c5bb726dc8301d6ae19c03072.jpg"},"added":"2021-06-14T21:42:57+00:00","modified":"2021-09-10T04:36:39+00:00","filename":"3bfdb37c5bb726dc8301d6ae19c03072.jpg","authentication":"14a08f599b5d4041ef730bb9ae9ee30e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_002_fl_067_018_002_o2.jpg","size":1471379,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2736,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049794881687242796564074609477756894193589687347412109375},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20201208"],"TimeCreated":["221853-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 2"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20201208"],"TimeCreated":["221853-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 2"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20201208"],"TimeCreated":["221853-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 2"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1394,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1394","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"his face is quite full.

Malcolm was much pleased with the letters and I am sure they will be a great help to him in learning to spell. Marvin notices the red ball, which I hang in front of him sometimes. This past week he will smile  and chortle nearly every time I speak to him. Also smiles at Max and Malcolm. He is such a good child - lies awake for such a long time without crying at all and sleeps a long time at night without nursing. Never have to rock him to sleep or bother with him, just put him down and he goes to sleep sooner or later, without any fuss, when he gets ready. \n\nAm beginning to train him. Started yesterday and saved 3 diapers. It seems hard to realize that he is only 6 weeks old he seems so much bigger than most babies at that age. \n\non side:\nAnna wants the boy to stay alone after a few days and she will go back to town. Morris looks strong, a little pale, perhaps.

Yours just rec'd. Glad books arrived safely. Have just finished reading \"This Side of Paradise\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. A very worth-while and\n\nentertaining book. One gets a very wrong impression of it from the book reviews. Got it from our local library which I am pleased to find, has all the\nbest-sellers always on tap. Got Julius's \"Dust\" yesterday. Looks quite readable. Have not yet started it. Saw a copy of \"Growth of the Soil\" on the shelves the other\nday but preferred to read the Fitzgerald book first. Have my name on the waiting list for \"Main Street\". They take your phone number and call you up when it comes in. No such service as that in the Chicago public library and no such chance of getting hold of the best sellers, either.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":120239,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/120239","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/59d71083b0217c886995aaa1e25462d1.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/59d71083b0217c886995aaa1e25462d1.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/59d71083b0217c886995aaa1e25462d1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/59d71083b0217c886995aaa1e25462d1.jpg"},"added":"2021-06-14T21:43:35+00:00","modified":"2021-08-26T20:56:01+00:00","filename":"59d71083b0217c886995aaa1e25462d1.jpg","authentication":"c06c88da058c463c24b00fcc475f1548","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_002_fl_067_031_002_o2.jpg","size":1435964,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2701,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0492260753904589509755140852576005272567272186279296875},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20201208"],"TimeCreated":["222354-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 2"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20201208"],"TimeCreated":["222354-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 2"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20201208"],"TimeCreated":["222354-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 2"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1394,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1394","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Will send for Growth of the Soil for your birthday and have them mail it direct.

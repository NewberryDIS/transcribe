in behalf of the United Sates is most likely to conciliate their attachment. But it ought to be conducted without fraud, without extortion, with constant and plentiful supplies; with a ready market for the commodities of the Indians and a stated price for what the give in payment and receive in exchange you will see by this recommendation of the President to congress more than six moons ago, of the regulations of the Trade, which you now speak of -  That this subject will be again pursued by the next Congress, and that some arrangements will be made by the next Spring.  I have no other intention but that Capt. McCaleb should conduct you to the frontiers. I know his value too well to part with him, until he puts you in your own Country. I will consider the proposition you have made of a post at the Ocunnee Mountain - I will mention it to the President.\" -\n\nCapt McCaleb then said it was the earnest desire of the Indians that General Pickens might have notice to provide a guard for them and their goods to their own   This was agreed to by the Secretary of War. -   The Secretary of War then distributed silver arm bands and silver medals to the Chiefs and Warriors who were present. -\nThe articles were then respectively signed by the Secretary of War, and the principal Chiefs in the presence of respectable witnesses, and interchanged; and the articles with one great white Belt were given to Mr Dinsmoor to carry into the Cherokee

Cherokee Nation May 16, 1828\nDear Madam,\nIt is a year since I wrote to you; But I understand that you have not recieved the letter. In my other letter, I mentioned the love I had towards Mrs. Dean, and how much good she has done me. I mentioned that they left their son here. I took care of it while it was here and at my fathers. They had it there five or six months. I loved both of their children very much as well as I do my brothers and sisters. When Mr. and Mrs. Dean went away I was not here, I was at my fathers taking care of their son. I wished to see them before they went away. They were father and mother to me, and it almost makes me shed tears to think about them and how many pleasant hours I spent in working with her and playing with Chester. There has been more attention to religion at this Station and in this neighbourhood than usual. Among others the girls of this school? have thought more about the Saviour and that that they were sinners. Some of them think that their sins are forgiven. I have thought more than I did and some times I think they my heart is changed and at times I am doubtful. I love to think about the Saviour and love to pray to Him, and pray that there may be a revival of religion here.  My studies at present, Reading, Spelling, Writing, Wood bridge's Geography and spelling the definition in the spelling book and Colbrom's Arithmetick. The girls are learning fast.

I continue still in school at Brainerd, and am well pleased with my education. Our school is large containing fifty scholars. It will be about three months before vacation, then we will all go to our homes. Father's family were well the last I heard from them. I expect him here next Saturday. Thomas is attending school a short distance from home . My studies are at present, Reading, Writing, Spelling, Geography, Arithmetic, and the definition of words. My studies occupy the greater part of my time. Father is very well satisfied with my improvement this last season. We scarcely ever see any white people excepting the missionaries and a few travellers. Our neighbors are all Cherokees.  I often think of my dear friends in Tennessee and wish to see them very much. But I am perfectly willing to stay in this nation. although I should be very glad to stay with grandfather.

Respected Madam, I have long wished to write to you, but have had no good opportunity until now. I have felt a greater desire to write because you were anxious that there might be a revival of religion in this place. Perhaps you have no heard of the seriousness that has been at this station, if you have not it would no doubt, be interesting to hear of it. There has been much more feeling at this place upon the subject of religion since you left us. Many have felt the need of a Saviour. We were afraid it was decreasing and I do not think there is so much feeling in the school but we are more encouraged about the neighbours. We have great reason to praise the Lord for His goodness and for His wonderful works to the children of men. We lately received a letter from Mr. Holland which informs us that the Lord is carrying on His work there. They hope four are born again and many inquiring what they should do to be saved. he says there are six different places that he holds meetings besides the Sabbath. He likewise mentioned that last Sabbath there was the largest audience he ever witnessed, since his residence at that place. What glorious news to hear of sinners turning to the Lord It ought to rejoice the hearts of all christians. But to return to this station from which I have digressed. A few have hoped in the Lord Jesus. Eleanor North has left the school and married. She expressed a hope before she went away. Betsey Taylor still continues to go to school she expressed a hope a few weeks ago but has now given it up.

But there is great danger of being deceived, and it would be dreadful to go on in this life thinking we were in the way to Heaven and at least be cast from the presence of God. If I have got a new heart I do not feel as though I had done anything to merit it. I feel it to be a free gift. I want sinners to become christians. I ought to be more devoted to God.

I did not attend day school when you were here but have attended about two months. It is with difficulty as I am the only help in Mothers family which consists of six in number. I do the washing in the morning before school with some help. I go till half past two in the afternoon. My studies are Reading, Spelling, Writing, Geography, and Arithmetic.

They are much pleased with the permission their kind teacher granted them, she requested them to write with as much freedom on the subject of religion as they would speak to their parents and as the same privilege is granted me; If you will not think me too forward tell something of the exercise of my mind. When a child I was often affected with a sense of sin  as I grew older these seasons became more frequent. I never could go to class without first saying a few words in the form of a prayer. About a year since the family were much encouraged with the appearance of a reival of religion. Some of the children were deeply affected also the neighbors paid better attention to preaching. I then had a realizing sense of my danger while out of Christ. Before this I had an idea religion would make me gloomy and melancholy. I found many obstacles in the way. I endeavoured to make myself a little better so Christ would not have so many sins to pardon: the more I tried the more sinful I appeared to myself. In a few days I trust I was enabled to feel willing Christ should do all and have the glory. I hope the Savior was then pleased since that for the most part of the time I have enjoyed the comforts of religion.

And I am glad of the opportunity. I sometimes imagine that you may feel bad that you have a daughter so far from you; and when I look upon my dear teacher it makes me pity her very much because she is so far away from her dear mother, brother, and sisters. I sometimes think that I should be willing that she should leave the school to visit you, though I should be sorry to part with her. I do not know that she wishes to go, for she says she is as happy as she was in teaching in New England. She rejoices me very much when she receives letters. I watched the mail and when it arrives, I tell her and she says \"go and see if I have any letters.\" Yesterday she received one from Virginia, and I had one from a lady in Charleston. I did not wait to get mine but caught up hers and ran to her and forgot mine. I think I feel as sorry as she does when there is none for her. I can write more than I could say if you were here.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71500,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71500","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/0016bef613c7b315220620c1b219eb88.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/0016bef613c7b315220620c1b219eb88.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/0016bef613c7b315220620c1b219eb88.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0016bef613c7b315220620c1b219eb88.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T14:07:25+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:09+00:00","filename":"0016bef613c7b315220620c1b219eb88.jpg","authentication":"9acc85f1c87cd1c3860274fd22032dd0","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL08_FL001_00016_o2.jpg","size":528436,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2179,"compression_ratio":0.04490982951744799944737707164676976390182971954345703125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["`"],"DateCreated":["20120620"],"TimeCreated":["085414+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["`"],"DateCreated":["20120620"],"TimeCreated":["085414+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[" `"],"DateCreated":["20120620"],"TimeCreated":["085414+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0016bef613c7b315220620c1b219eb88.jpg","FileDateTime":1522678012,"FileSize":528436,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2179\"","Height":2179,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2179,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:17:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3934},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:20 08:54:14","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:20 08:54:14","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":94,"SubSecTimeOriginal":94,"SubSecTimeDigitized":94,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2179,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1059,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1059","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I think more than I can talk.

We have written several letters to Miss Ames friends and they have answered them in her letters and every time they write to her, they send their respect to us. I wish some of them would come and visit this station. When the hours of school are over and we sit down to sewing we ask her a great many questions about the North and her friends. It seems as though I could see them and the places she tells us about, she cannot always sit with us as she is obliged to cut out socks and other clothing for the scholars and she then has to make them. Sometimes I think we have got all the sewing done then she will find something else which she says is needing to be done.

Yours with much respect,  Nancy Reece. \nMy dear Elizabeth, I have heard my teacher talk about you a great deal, and should be glad to write to you. I wish to tell you somethings.

Respected Sir, Miss Ames says she has no time to write and I will write for her. I know that you are a friend to the Cherokees because Miss Ames and Miss Sargent has told us so and I know you are by the letters which you have written to us. I do not think that all the peoples are friends to the Cherokees. Miss Ames has been reading a part of the Presid message. Perhaps she does not like the laws of the Indian tribes for she says \"this state of things requires that a remedy should be provided\" Miss Ames has been talking to the scholars and she felt very bad and told them that they must get a good education as soon as they can so they can teach if they should be moved where they could not attend school and says that we must try to get religion for all the instructors ought to be christians. It seems that it will be a trying season to us and the missionaries if we should be separated from them, but she says if God suffers it to be we ought not to complain for it will be for the best.

I have a class of the younger children in sabbath school, I ask these children who do not talk english if they understood the sermon that was read and they so they do not but when my father comes on sabbath days he talks in Cherokee, then they tell me a great deal he says. I try to tell them how to spend the sabbath day and tell them where they will go when they die if they are not good. When they first enter school if they are asked these questions they often say they dont know. When school hours are over, the girls attend to domestic concerns and learn to make their own clothes and the clothes of the boys so they can do such work when they go home to assist their parents.

We can see the difference between the girls in this school and the Chackinnau? girl. After Miss Ames reads it to us I thought that we ought to try and be like her. I know very well that we have not tryed so much to have new hearts as she did, when I think about the judgement day and that it may come and find me unpreserved and that God's word tells us that \"the wicked will call for the rocks and mountain to fall on them and hide them from the face of Him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb. I then think I see the importance of being prepared to meet God, and I say in my heart I will try to seek religion. But then my attention is taken up with other things and I forget these promises. I then think sure God will leave me if I do not exert myself more then I have done. I often think happy  the children of God will be in the day of judgement when they find the Saviour their friend.

The parents of the children brought the cloth for the greatest part of them. Some of them are calico to wear on sabbath days and the others to wear on other days of the week are Cherokee cotton cloth which they spun and wove themselves. We had some calico and American gingham sent to us as for events by the friends of the missionaries to whom we have written. They are to wear sabbath days.

N. Feb 20 1829. My dear friends, Miss Sargent has requested me to write to you. She has told me about Miss SHerwood your teacher she says that she wishes all the heathen to be civilized and have the knowledge of the Saviour. She says that she is a friend to the missionaries and that she used to do a great deal for them she used to make garments and send them out to their indians. She says that she came from the same place where she used to visit and she used to go around about the towns and beg money to support missionaries. Miss Ames has just read her letter to Miss Sargent to us. I was very much pleased to hear that she had so large a number of scholars. She said a great many people in Georgia had become Christian and a great number of them had joined the church like wise she mentioned some of her scholars become christian and a number of sabbath school teachers. I did not know that there were so many that were christians. I do not think these christian people wish us to remove. I think they wish us to be civilized and be like their christian people. I have read much in the papers about the Georgians wishing the Cherokees to remove from their native country. We have a charitable society among ourselves. We have heard what was doing among other people in their societies. We thought that we could form one. It is not long since our society was established.

I felt as though I wished to write to  you, because I knew you was a friend to us, and I think we ought to be thankful that God has given us minds that we can write fine hand. I felt as though I wished to write to you, because I knew you was a friend to us, and I think we aught to be thankful that God has given us minds that we can write and we ought to be more thankful that he has given his Son Jesus to die upon the cross to save sinners. I think this is the greatest thing that God has done. I remember when you was here you told us if we were good you should hear of it, and you said if we were not good children you should likewise hear of it. We hear of other heathen becoming Christians and that they feel thankful for what is taught them. MIss Ames read about a little girl at the Sandwich Island. She is now a Princess.

There are thirty scholars in school. Twenty six Cherokee girls besides myself. Three white girls. My parents live seven miles from this place. They both belong to the church, and my father was a warrior and did not think so much about the education of his children. Now he is very anxious to have his children learn. He is an elder of this church and an interpreter for preachers. I have 2 brothers who think the Lord is their friend. One united with the church last summer whose name is Samuel Wocester and WIlliam Reece who expects to unite with the church our next communion which will be in the 3rd sabbath in May. I have heard what the situation of the Indians of the country was nearly 2 hundred years ago and how good people went to teach them and labouring among them and after they had laboured their then some of them became pious and helped them in preaching. At this present time I expect their are many christian Indians. I have also heard of Mr Mayhen missionary to Marthas Vineyard.

And I think we ought to be very thankful that the good people at the North has done so much for the Cherokees. We have no minister in this place he has removed to another station so he could learn the Cherokees language. We do not have any preaching other than once in two months except when some ministers from the neighboring Stations or some traveling minister calls. And I am going to ask you one question will you please Mr Thatcher to ask the Board to send in a minister? I will tell you how the Cherokees live they generally live in log houses and cabbins, though some have framed ones. Some of our neighbors go to the next of government and to the neightboring states and see how civilized people build houses and they begin to live a little as they do. They have gardens and cultivate fields some of them have ?een? sheep, horses, and a great many swine. They have all kinds of fruits such as are peaches apples pears and the veggatables are sweet potatos, beans, peas corn, groundnuts, and turnips &c. which they raise for their family to live on. But a great many of the Cherokees are poor and ignorant and live so poorly that they have scarcely any houses or clothes there they often go to those families that can take care of themselves and if such families do not mention them they think they are stingy.

Mr. Addison percieved that he was given over by his physicians, and felt his end approaching, he sent for a young man of a very irregular life, and perhaps loose oppinions, whom he had before endeavored to reclaim, but arguments and expostulations had no effect. The young man who was not wanting in respect for Mr. Addison, came at his request. Mr. Addison, who was extremely feeble, and whose life, at this moment, hung quivering on his lips, observed a profound silence. After a long pause, the youth at length addressed him, \"Sir, you desired me to  see you; signify your commands, and I will execute them with religious punctuality.\" Addison took him by the hand, and

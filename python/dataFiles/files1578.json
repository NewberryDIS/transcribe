Comrade Debs, the day of our execution is approaching speedly, and we do not know the least thing of what is going on, what the Governor intend to do, what and how his appointed commission. We are just in the tickest [sic] darkness. \n  The Defence and the Committee have asked G. Fuller to announce a posponment of the date of our execution, on three grounds: 1rst. Because at the date the commission of investigation appointed by the Gov. has not yet began its investigation and, safe a riprive, we shall be executed within less than three weeks: how could be possible to study thoroughly, [?] and wholly, in less than three weeks, a case that lasted seven years of legal procedures, with two trials which lasted, globally, over ten weeks, and with seven voluminous appeals?","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":138706,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/138706","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/58886b604bd70781e960a3fefa6f05d9.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/58886b604bd70781e960a3fefa6f05d9.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/58886b604bd70781e960a3fefa6f05d9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/58886b604bd70781e960a3fefa6f05d9.jpg"},"added":"2023-01-26T16:36:46+00:00","modified":"2023-01-31T05:07:39+00:00","filename":"58886b604bd70781e960a3fefa6f05d9.jpg","authentication":"9593fb9c2cef798a4706d6b623dca26f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_brommel_debs_box_007_fl_088_002_004.jpg","size":170670,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":963,"resolution_y":1200,"compression_ratio":0.04922983731394946216308738939915201626718044281005859375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Bernard J.

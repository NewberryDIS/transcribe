The Sabbaths here seems akin to Dunbarton Sabbaths for quietude disturbed only by bird, music, and, at meeting time, by the coming of country carriages to the old fashioned church. Were you ever inside it?  The high pews, with dark green fronts give it a sombre appearance. We walk in, facing the congregation. Pulpit at the entrance.  One needs to remove? ones-self to meet the eyes on entering.  I feel as if it were Sabbath all the week.  There is such a sense of rest of \"occupation gone\"  I don't think I fully enjoy it yet.  Though I would'nt have your support I am in the least unhappy.  I do not think I have felt for some months the light heartedness.\nSha'nt you be here by the 28th? or cannot you tell yet! Love to all.

We went to Portland as we expected last Monday. It is a sad sight. It took a full hour to ride over the burnt district, not stopping at all. There was a very strong wind at the time of the fire, and it seems as if nothing could arrest its progress - Cinders were picked up in Yarmouth the next morning. It was so sad to see the ruined trees. We rode the whole length of streets that, before the fire, were lined with tall Elms that shaded elegant residences on either side - now nothing is left but ruins - tall chimneys scorched & blackened trees, and now and then a part of the wall of a brick building. Not a vestage of Dr. Carruthers church but some cross beams lying in the sand. The walls of the elegant city buildings are mostly standing, but entirely cleaned out within, and cracked from top to bottom in varis places. The Post Office of stone is in such a condition that they do business in it, and have all the while. Everything all around it is gone. It was said to be a fine sight to see the flames roll up against it, time and again without seeming to have power to harm it. The glass throughout the building is all gone. What a world of work to clean away the rubbish.

July 26, 1866\n\nMy dearest -\n\n I wish you were home this most lovely of mornings. The sunshine, the singing of birds, and the delicious air, with the views that never can anywhere be surpassed, it seems to me, make it glorious. Here, at Dea Parker's, the view is very extensive. Kearsarge, Monadnock and the White Mountains can be seen, as well as the ranges of smaller hills. I mailed a letter to you at Concord Tuesday morning on the way here. But I have not heard from you since last Friday, almost a week. I think there must be a letter for me at the office but- we have not heard from there, since I came. It has been rather hard to be patient. Dea Parker says he will go this P.M. to the office & I shall go to, and make calls and perhaps spend the night somewhere.

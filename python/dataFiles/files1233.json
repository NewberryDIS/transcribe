At an Early age she became an open decided Christian, + has since made a clear steady progress in the Xtn life.\n2. She has a bright active mind, ever learning + ever gaining new stores of knowledge. She possesses a ready sound practical judgement - \"a sanctified common sense\" - not at all cranky or crotchety.\n3. She is accustomed to Xtn work - has a genuine love for it - is quite at home in it - Eminently gentle + judicious.\nI know of no young lady whom I could so unreservedly recommend as fitted to be a true, faithful, successful missionary at home or abroad. - possessing in marked? measure the proposed \"qualification for missionaries + assistant missionaries.\"\nVery truly yours,\nEdwin E.

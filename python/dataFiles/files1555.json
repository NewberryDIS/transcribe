T and Wright and I went to the apartment of a very interesting young woman that I think you have not met -- Laelah Cooper advertising manager of Household. T fell in love with Laelah, and Laelah reciprocates her affection. We have had tea at T's studio.\nMarco came to town last week, and T. Laelah Marco and I had dinner together. T read a letter on art and artists that she had written to someone not named. It is unusual -- a fresh viewpoint -- and made an impression. We all urged her to make an essay of it and send it to Mercury. It deals with the reflex of external conditions on the artist, and his attempt to establish a balance. Rather authentic in its psychology. An imperative against the soul sickness of the period.\nI have another indefinite lunch engagement with Don. Will try to pick up what I can about with Don. Will try to pick up what I can about things of yours that he has -- though it may take a little time so as not to roil the waters.\nI do not think you need have any fear on this score. T is much more her old self apparently, than she was even a year ago. She seems to have recovered her poise -- her quiet jollity, and her whimsical cynicism.

There the booking agent did them dirt -- tied up the box office receipts and tried to get the company away from O'Neil. That left the outfit stranded. T hustled around and raised $1000 in Philadelphia that partly paid salaries to the clamoring company, and they went back to New York to play a week at a Negro house. T. says \"Its been hard work, but enthusiasm and excitement -- good tonics. It is only now that we are about through with the season and are facing the financial problem of getting them back to Chicago, that I realize how tired I am.\"\nI am plugging away -- slowly -- on my second story. It has got me into a field where I have to cast about a bit. Ive got the psychology all right -- but I have to familiarize myself with the setting. \nThere is not much to tell you. I'm playing a lone hand -- see very few outside the business grind, which as usual is quite too pestiferous.

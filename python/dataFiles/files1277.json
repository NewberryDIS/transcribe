Well after supper, Charles came in, he gave me a rale good letter! I went down town with him. I did not hardly have time to speak to him was not with him half an hour hardly.\nErgo, I now sit down to answer your letters, as I had nothing written when C. was here, and did not have time to tell him 1\/2 as Joe said. First, I guess that there is not much danger of my hurting my health to work as I am used to it and good for it \"to boot.\" As for work I guess I am to work as early in the morn as you are. Play, caught not fish! Lambs, I was not there to take care of them. As for jobs all I have done is to split up a little wood for C. Harris, next neighbor, about 1 1\/2 hours. Mr. W and I had a talk about board etc. last week and he concluded that as he had go the stump price bush hole as Joe says, that he should have enough for me to do, to pay for my board spell at least. I get up between 4 & 4 1\/2, make fire, milk & go out to work 5, breakfast 7 or little after. It does not per diem agree with me very well to work so long before breakfast. I don't go out at noon, or after breakfast commonly 3 or 4  hours. I take care cow, get water, wood, do errand, et cetera besides etc etc. So I study most of the time at noon, in eve, and morn sometimes. I get along well in Virgil, Algebra, &c.

I was ploughed a little, wed: but it is baked down miserable. I have to dig it up with a shovel; mix it in manure eten it is rather hard work. I have enough to do all of the time, out of School: more than pay for my board I guess rather\nI work 4 or 5 hours per diem, none at noon though.

I have worn the Tarpawlin as yet mostly, but it will be to warm by and by, I guess I can get along if I have a Palm leaf. If I could have some kind of a green baise or white cotton or linen Jacket or frock to wear  to school it would be an excellent plan,  Save my Coat of which there is need as I have nothing else to wear to Church.\n\n The Brown Cloth is miserable stuff, always awful dirty.

I immediately set to inquiring concerning the market for pratoes and judged it expedient or rather necessary to write by the next morn mail. I did not get home toll towards 9, then had to write a letter, half a days work,  and get up very early to put it in the mail, too. - Excuse etc.\n\nThe principal news now is - that I am going to leave Mr. Worcester's. How so? you ask, I suppose; Well. Mrs. W.'s last summer's boarder Mr. Albert Paine came back here to board a little while ago Well, Mr. John B. Hill had spoke to Mr. W.  last winter about boarding here and little more than a week ago he came wanted to come immediately, and would take my denial. I suppose Mr. W. thought it would be more profitable to have per week and do his chores himself and hire his work done\nSo as Mr. John B. wanted a chamber I had to quit. Mr. W. said he was very sorry that I could not stay all summer, that it would have been very convenient for him etc., but I suppose Mrs. W. was opposed to my coming at first as it would be no help to her and make some work etc.  I dont now certain where I shall go certain on account of Mrs. Parker's state. Mr. Wm. Abbot C.S.S.C. talked of wanting a boy only his wife is now not at home, but said if I could not find any other place he would see about it. both would be excellent places. Mrs. Parker is very feeble indeed cannot remain long.\nMr. Worcester is from N.H. is a nephew of Noah and Sammel Worcester. He says it is a very bad plan to study to hard, said he went through Graeca Minerva in 3 month and 11 days, reviewed it, reviewed it in a fortnight etc. studied 18 hours per day, (not moderately either I guess) but said he lost a great deal by it, I was sick almost a year, and now I cant study over 6 hours per day with profit. It is Vacation at the Seminary Mrs. Hatch is gone out of town. Mr. Willy, Wiley or whatever is going to open a Singing school next Wed. for Youth people Terms $,50 for 3 months every Wed. and Sat. P.M. - Cheap.\n\nI should like to see; your bundle for me, I need the Stock; Lute is a rale good gall, only I see she has not got over her silliness. Why did I not hear from Eliab in the last letter?

I have not sold the wood, and I dont see as I am likely to for $,50 per pound or any thing near it. I think it must be a mistake about wood selling at Exeter for $,60. Here - Nobody wants to buy wood. Woods \"dont buy any wood now, and pay cash, at any price,\" he says. Lunt or Campbell and Mills \"dont want wool,will take pelts.\" Larrabee will take pelts or wool, clean washed, (since sheared), but at nothing like 50 cents. I went all round Friday and enquired, although I was most ashamed to, I have been so many times before; but could get no encouragement. Meanwhile I have got but little more than $.50 and have not paid for coat yet entirely or got me either boots or Shoes. and I must (ought to) have a pr. of Gloves of some kind to wear to meeting, immediately etc. etc. etc. \"Vats\" to  be did?  I sez.\n\nI want some Mittens right away, my hands are really uncomfortably cold this very Sat. morning, turning out the old cow!\n\n You will see that I am \"check full\" of wants, of all kinds, names and sizes; but I dont see how it can be helped.  I have been almost thinking, that it would be best, to go quit the field for the present and go home to work till I could be ready, and fixed (Where\/when would it be?) but it would be rather a a pity now that I have got fairly begun and in for it; besides I should get very behind my class in Every thing and could not get up\n\n[left-hand side] I am glad Charles went to the Cattle show etc. but Sorry for his work which I fear is behind hand.\n[upside down at top of letter] I have got a bad cold at present. I guess I shall borrow a dollar or two of James F.W. and pay off Mr. Fox for I told him I thought I should get the money next week and next week has come a great while ago. I dont like to be in debt.\nI suppose I had better send home the vest that Mr. Fox cut out of the coat cloth and have it made up at home I am sorry that the blue vest you made last summer was not double breasted.\n[near Salutation] Write Often to me do.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102057,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102057","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/3b89298857fd5841403db30e97587982.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/3b89298857fd5841403db30e97587982.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/3b89298857fd5841403db30e97587982.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3b89298857fd5841403db30e97587982.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:45:47+00:00","modified":"2020-09-09T03:58:20+00:00","filename":"3b89298857fd5841403db30e97587982.jpg","authentication":"82558f0a564351f3afa97f08ae07e9f4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_166_008_002_o2.jpg","size":1664129,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2898,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053169778646832},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040333"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040333"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040333"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3b89298857fd5841403db30e97587982.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803513,"FileSize":1664129,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2898\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2898,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:19:39","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:03:33","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:03:33","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":68,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3101,"ExifImageLength":3852,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"You See, (If I stay here) I have to twice every day, go into a little dirty barn or stable, and milk an old cow, what's laid in that same old dirty stall, all night, besides taking care of her, two pigs and other dirty work.

Mr. Walker has lately, last week, got a new, cite and and excellent looking stove and set up it the, late dining room, now to be called the kitchen, he has also got a great Sink put up and has the aqueduct water come into the would be kitchen, Meanwhile the little, old kitchen is cast, off an goes to grass as a backroom.  This innovation has made a great change in the appearance of things, the old Fire frame is cast out, the fireplace, overhauled, and built up entirely with brick. The funnel goes right up stairs into the back entry, where is a large drum, as it is called, for the purpose of heating the chamber. It will make the chamber where I sleep most as warm as it is down stairs, so you see it will be nice about lodging evenings etc. I tried it last eve. the fire was kept in the stove, and I studied up stairs, it was nice and comfortable, mmmm, but it made my head ache I found.

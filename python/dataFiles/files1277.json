Well after supper, Charles came in, he gave me a rale good letter! I went down town with him. I did not hardly have time to speak to him was not with him half an hour hardly.\nErgo, I now sit down to answer your letters, as I had nothing written when C. was here, and did not have time to tell him 1\/2 as Joe said. First, I guess that there is not much danger of my hurting my health to work as I am used to it and good for it \"to boot.\" As for work I guess I am to work as early in the morn as you are. Play, caught not fish! Lambs, I was not there to take care of them. As for jobs all I have done is to split up a little wood for C. Harris, next neighbor, about 1 1\/2 hours. Mr. W and I had a talk about board etc. last week and he concluded that as he had go the stump price bush hole as Joe says, that he should have enough for me to do, to pay for my board spell at least. I get up between 4 & 4 1\/2, make fire, milk & go out to work 5, breakfast 7 or little after. It does not per diem agree with me very well to work so long before breakfast. I don't go out at noon, or after breakfast commonly 3 or 4  hours. I take care cow, get water, wood, do errand, et cetera besides etc etc. So I study most of the time at noon, in eve, and morn sometimes. I get along well in Virgil, Algebra, &c. I have not caepit Greek yet as there is no class and I could not get along do anything alone.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102038,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102038","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f76825d66ac42c8a1667112318f225c0.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f76825d66ac42c8a1667112318f225c0.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f76825d66ac42c8a1667112318f225c0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f76825d66ac42c8a1667112318f225c0.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:45:21+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"f76825d66ac42c8a1667112318f225c0.jpg","authentication":"41db054297807ea5c9ab28b067b253d6","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_166_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1772865,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3184,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051555956867671996757263030985996010713279247283935546875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040150"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040150"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040150"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f76825d66ac42c8a1667112318f225c0.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803512,"FileSize":1772865,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3184\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3184,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:18:49","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:01:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:01:50","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3077,"ExifImageLength":3478,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Page 3d\nI saw Mrs. Parker the other day, she is not expected\nto live but a short time, she appeared glad to see me.\nI sent her love to you, said she should not see you again\nin this world, but hoped to in another.

We have not commenced opperations upon it yet though. Mrs. W. cultivates this year a day bed in the shape of a garden 2 doors off from here.  I was ploughed a little, wed: but it is baked down miserable. I have to dig it up with a shovel; mix it in manure eten it is rather hard work. I have enough to do all of the time, out of School: more than pay for my board I guess rather\nI work 4 or 5 hours per diem, none at noon though. I have wrote a letter to Ann, put it in the P.O. yesterday. When did you get my last letter and who brought it? I left it at Chase et.

I have worn the Tarpawlin as yet mostly, but it will be to warm by and by, I guess I can get along if I have a Palm leaf. If I could have some kind of a green baise or white cotton or linen Jacket or frock to wear  to school it would be an excellent plan,  Save my Coat of which there is need as I have nothing else to wear to Church.\n\n The Brown Cloth is miserable stuff, always awful dirty. I have worn the Drab pants most of the time but they look neat and clean- the others are dirty, It has been very Smoky here for several days, hardly see the sun.

I immediately set to inquiring concerning the market for pratoes and judged it expedient or rather necessary to write by the next morn mail. I did not get home toll towards 9, then had to write a letter, half a days work,  and get up very early to put it in the mail, too. - Excuse etc.\n\nThe principal news now is - that I am going to leave Mr. Worcester's. How so? you ask, I suppose; Well. Mrs. W.'s last summer's boarder Mr. Albert Paine came back here to board a little while ago Well, Mr. John B. Hill had spoke to Mr. W.  last winter about boarding here and little more than a week ago he came wanted to come immediately, and would take my denial. I suppose Mr. W. thought it would be more profitable to have per week and do his chores himself and hire his work done\nSo as Mr. John B. wanted a chamber I had to quit. Mr. W. said he was very sorry that I could not stay all summer, that it would have been very convenient for him etc., but I suppose Mrs. W. was opposed to my coming at first as it would be no help to her and make some work etc.  I dont now certain where I shall go certain on account of Mrs. Parker's state. Mr. Wm. Abbot C.S.S.C. talked of wanting a boy only his wife is now not at home, but said if I could not find any other place he would see about it. both would be excellent places. Mrs. Parker is very feeble indeed cannot remain long.\nMr. Worcester is from N.H. is a nephew of Noah and Sammel Worcester. He says it is a very bad plan to study to hard, said he went through Graeca Minerva in 3 month and 11 days, reviewed it, reviewed it in a fortnight etc. studied 18 hours per day, (not moderately either I guess) but said he lost a great deal by it, I was sick almost a year, and now I cant study over 6 hours per day with profit. It is Vacation at the Seminary Mrs. Hatch is gone out of town. Mr. Willy, Wiley or whatever is going to open a Singing school next Wed. for Youth people Terms $,50 for 3 months every Wed. and Sat. P.M. - Cheap.\n\nI should like to see; your bundle for me, I need the Stock; Lute is a rale good gall, only I see she has not got over her silliness. Why did I not hear from Eliab in the last letter?

Oct. 5th 1839\n\nDear Mater et soror\n\n  Wed. night I saw Mr. N. Hatch jun. direct from Milo, who gave me two letters and umbrellas: you may be sure the letters were a nice feast after digging potatoes all the after noon. I have not sold the wood, and I dont see as I am likely to for $,50 per pound or any thing near it. I think it must be a mistake about wood selling at Exeter for $,60. Here - Nobody wants to buy wood. Woods \"dont buy any wood now, and pay cash, at any price,\" he says. Lunt or Campbell and Mills \"dont want wool,will take pelts.\" Larrabee will take pelts or wool, clean washed, (since sheared), but at nothing like 50 cents. I went all round Friday and enquired, although I was most ashamed to, I have been so many times before; but could get no encouragement. Meanwhile I have got but little more than $.50 and have not paid for coat yet entirely or got me either boots or Shoes. and I must (ought to) have a pr. of Gloves of some kind to wear to meeting, immediately etc. etc. etc. \"Vats\" to  be did?  I sez.\n\nI want some Mittens right away, my hands are really uncomfortably cold this very Sat. morning, turning out the old cow!\n\n You will see that I am \"check full\" of wants, of all kinds, names and sizes; but I dont see how it can be helped.  I have been almost thinking, that it would be best, to go quit the field for the present and go home to work till I could be ready, and fixed (Where\/when would it be?) but it would be rather a a pity now that I have got fairly begun and in for it; besides I should get very behind my class in Every thing and could not get up\n\n[left-hand side] I am glad Charles went to the Cattle show etc. but Sorry for his work which I fear is behind hand.\n[upside down at top of letter] I have got a bad cold at present. I guess I shall borrow a dollar or two of James F.W. and pay off Mr. Fox for I told him I thought I should get the money next week and next week has come a great while ago. I dont like to be in debt.\nI suppose I had better send home the vest that Mr. Fox cut out of the coat cloth and have it made up at home I am sorry that the blue vest you made last summer was not double breasted.\n[near Salutation] Write Often to me do.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102057,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102057","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3b89298857fd5841403db30e97587982.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3b89298857fd5841403db30e97587982.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3b89298857fd5841403db30e97587982.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3b89298857fd5841403db30e97587982.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:45:47+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"3b89298857fd5841403db30e97587982.jpg","authentication":"82558f0a564351f3afa97f08ae07e9f4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_166_008_002_o2.jpg","size":1664129,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2898,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053169778646831998558663912035626708529889583587646484375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040333"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040333"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040333"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3b89298857fd5841403db30e97587982.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803513,"FileSize":1664129,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2898\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2898,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:19:39","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:03:33","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:03:33","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":68,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3101,"ExifImageLength":3852,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"You See, (If I stay here) I have to twice every day, go into a little dirty barn or stable, and milk an old cow, what's laid in that same old dirty stall, all night, besides taking care of her, two pigs and other dirty work.

The single tickets for the course were sold at $1,50 apeice, But the next day, (before the lectures commenced) Mr. Worcester recieved a note from Mr. B. informing him that his scholars might recieve tickets for ,50 the course, if their money forward through him Mr W. & Mr. B. himself.

Mr. Walker and James have both been gone most of this week, Mr. W. to Norridgewock and James to Hancock, where he is going to keep school this winter, they got back friday, So you see I have been the man of the house. The letter was excellent, but as far as the frock -- I guess it is no go -- I dont think I could wear it over my jacket or any other way hardly -- the sleeves are much to short and it is much to small round the neck and the whole upper part, round the arms too, while lower part is super abundantly larger. Marm? dont know how to cut out such a frock as that, I guess that the back of it must be cut in a separate peice, and very narrow at the bottom, whether or no something is the matter of this, it seem to pull right round somehow and towards the shoulders every way - can you tell how it suits me\u00a0!! ha! I can get along about mittens till I come home, I guess. I need a pair of good, knit suspenders by and by. If you send any thing for me to sell, you must write how much they cost, are worth, or ought to sell for, cause I might get cheated, you know! I have got my coat mended etc. well.\nAs for a chance for Ann to set up a private school here, I dont hardly think it would succeed. For besides Mr. Turners high school, which is very popular and a publick select school for girls taught by Mr. Valentine, a Miss, I believe, and Mr. Crane, into one  ? your teacher have a select private school for young ladies, which is very popular, and attended by those too paid an assistant etc. to the public high schools. There are also very many common private schools seal over? schools (publick),  one under good management and in very good esteem generally. There is no matier? french teacher.  he now, I understand,  Mr. [blank] has been a popular private teacher here many years, but since the public high school was instituted and before he took the publick select schools, he had hardly any scholars at all, most none. I have not been to Mr. Abbot as yet, and I dont know as I had better till there is a vacant situation which we should want to secure, and then I dont know but it would be just as well to speak only to Mr. Walker.

I can hardly remember when we last heard from Milo, and then only little scraps or billets. On fact I do not know that I have received a real, good, oldfashioned letter, one whole sheet, during this term. Charles has been down here once or twice, but in such a hurry that I have had no time to talk to him. I want very much to know how every thing gets along nowadays, how Mother's health is this summer, how Charles' affairs look and prosper, how the Crops etc. are going to come in, which appears of some importance, even if they will sell for nothing; how the boys do and feel, work and play etc. etc. I most wish I was at home, whenever I think of it.\n Mr. Walker is doing great things this Summer. William A. Wingate, Housewright, with his Apprentice, Samuel Small, has been here to work most of the time since June 1st. and is not near done yet. The Painters have been here a good deal already, but have just begun. The House is to be new painted all over, inside and out, also the fences and barn etc. etc. etc. etc. I have been pretty busily employed most of the time out of School from July 3d, to July  13th, one week. I employed it principally at work for Mr. Walker, about the house etc. got to be quite a carpenter. Expect to be paid for it by him, dont know how much.  Worked pretty well, 13 hours per day.\n We have had a good deal of very hot, sultry, unhealthy weather here this summer. Such Weather is much worse here than a Milo, I think. Sweat 6 hours in the Schoolroom, go to work and Sweat, go to bed and lay awake and sweat; Hot, Sweaty, Tired, Sleepy, and foolish all the Time. Very poor time, weather, and Chance to Study much, at least to really learn much. James F.W. has been about 1\/2 sick for sometime, a while ago, and alo is Sam, Small caprter.  And for 2 or 3 days past I have been most sick myself, neither worked or studied much. One awful hot day, got very hot indeed to work hard and then washing me in a hurry to go to School, cooled me so quick or something, that I caught cold I expect, and been not sick since","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102067,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102067","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b1486ba4ba50383f618a6c7e0343c2df.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b1486ba4ba50383f618a6c7e0343c2df.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b1486ba4ba50383f618a6c7e0343c2df.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b1486ba4ba50383f618a6c7e0343c2df.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:46:01+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"b1486ba4ba50383f618a6c7e0343c2df.jpg","authentication":"e4b6fee71c8dbbcc7bba48e2f86669a8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_167_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1518264,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2858,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04918824352694199653068807265299255959689617156982421875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040436"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040436"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040436"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b1486ba4ba50383f618a6c7e0343c2df.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803513,"FileSize":1518264,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2858\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2858,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:20:06","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:04:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:04:36","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":13,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3071,"ExifImageLength":3867,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Mrs. A.M.

I make out to get along very well with it. As for getting sick, there is no necessity for being alarmed. I have got a ducking several times, but I really believe it is a  benefit rather than otherwise, if one does not take cold, I think I have felt better for it, change my clothes a little, put on a dry woolen shirt.\n  The worst thing is, the work makes me sleepy,  go to work at 5 P.M. and work till about Dark 7 1\/2 or 8, if I want to go go to meeting, I feel so kinder tired and dull, I cant more than half hear or feel, if I dont actually get asleep.

Sabbath. Aug\/ 7th. 1842\n\nI expected to have received a letter from home last week but did not. I sent a letter a week ago last Wednesday, but am afraid you did not get it. as it was sent to the Post office by a private conveyance.\nIts principal object was to find out whether you wanted me to come to Milo to help do the haying. I take it for granted you do not, or you would have sent or come after me before this time. Most people have got through haying, about here. & I guess I have to.\n\n I carded nights all the time 4 weeks, the fifth week three nights & three days, and last week I did Mr. Curler's haying, he having one or two hands to help me, while he and Lysander were occupied in the Shop. It took hold of me pretty hard at first. My hands had become so very soft & tender, working only in the oily ? of the Mill, that I blistered them before noon, mowing, quite badly, and they were some sore for a day or two. Besides this, perhaps I took a little cold. I kinder sore and stiff all over, for a day or two, when not sweating. However I worked it off, in three or four days, felt better than before, did not tired me to work a bit.\n\nMonday, Man & boy to help me, mowed about all day, Tuesday, mowed in the forenoon and in the afternoon raked it all up 75 pretty large cocks, grass thin, ground rough.  Wednesday mowed in the morning, opened etc. all the hay. & Mr. Elijah Crane with his horse team helping got in 7 loads. He pitched on and I off. 5 loads ours, and 2 of his besides making up one load for him. 3 of us, besides Lysander raking after, P.M.  Pretty good days work, was it not? fifteen hundred at a load, at least.  In the afternoon I stick a pitchfork tine into my leg, just by the knee, considerable. after supper it began to be sore, swell up, lame, stiff when I went to bed it was much swelled all round the knee, very sore, hardly bend my leg at all, very lame, expected I had got to have a lame leg, perhaps be laid up for a spell. But (Mr. Cutler's folks are Thomsonians) I bandaged it in flannel with the miraculous Hot drops, rubbing some in well,  and truly wonderful to relate, it actually drew out the cold, took away the swelling and soreness and in the morning, my leg was about well\u00a0!!!!!\nI do actually believe, that, without its application, I should have had a lame leg.\nThursday I worked for Mr. Crane, for his work the day before.\nMr. Elijah Crane is a very fine man, very smart worker indeed in these parts,  but he has his hands full this year. Selectman, Sup. School. Corn. Administrator of Mr. Uphams estate, about which there is a good deal of fuss, building a new house, just like Mr. Cutlers, (2 carpenters all summer). a large farm and business to carry on, all himself.  but he is good for it, also his wife Julia Baker, used to be. This preceding is only a digression, for the purpose of introducing to your notice, his horse team,  He has a couple of small, round, tough little horses, valued at about 50 apeice. They have done all his farm work, hauled the stones for his cellar etc. no small riding round to boot, and been to Bangor in a  team 13 times, this summer, sleek and fat all the time, bright as a dollar. Would two like Pomp. do it? Horses are very low indeed, no market for them down east. If Pomp is sold this year, he will have to go to the West Indies.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102078,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102078","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/80fc46679af9c6830a11ce2da56e4a2e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/80fc46679af9c6830a11ce2da56e4a2e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/80fc46679af9c6830a11ce2da56e4a2e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/80fc46679af9c6830a11ce2da56e4a2e.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:46:15+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"80fc46679af9c6830a11ce2da56e4a2e.jpg","authentication":"ba2390be32472cf060758dee8634e4b7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_167_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1540888,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2377,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.06002306050265700243517841272478108294308185577392578125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040609"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040609"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040609"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"80fc46679af9c6830a11ce2da56e4a2e.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803514,"FileSize":1540888,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2377\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2377,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:20:37","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:06:09","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:06:09","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3097,"ExifImageLength":4690,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"But Friday and Sat. I had to go into the Shop again, as Mr. Cutler was most sick, Rheumatism in his back, bad. They were very hot, sultry days, and the Close confined air of the Shop after getting a full mouthful of the fresh open air of all out doors, haying, was almost enough to suffocate me made me fairly feel sick. I talked very strong of taking a regular Lobelia! but was cured not by steam but shower baths! I had a cold, and in my head, felt too full of blood. Pulling out one of the plugs in the floor, under the mill, afforded an excellent shower bath.\n\n I am retained to tale charge of the Shop all this week, as Mr. Cutler is going to Bangor tomorrow, and after that has got to go to Newport, and I shall have the finishing up of the Carding mostly, got about through with the carding this week, not week Mr. C. and Lysander will go preparing the fulling mill fixing up for the Cloth dressing business.\n Mr. Cutler says if I will I might stay, after this week, reaping then will be coming on, every body reaps grain here. I can find good chances to work out by the day reaping, if I wish to. I dont know, perhaps I shall come home in a week or so, to bring this letter to you, mei mamm. but I thought I would write a letter towards home to day as there has been meeting I could attend, and I felt rather homely.\n\nThere is a sort of Meeting up to Henry Hills corner, one of Millers lectures read by some one, but I concluded to stay at home. By the way the Miller doctrine is making quite an excitement about here. Many believe in it, perhaps most would think rather favorably of the subject, but some of the wild ones, (always some in every thing, you know) are so very about it. Even \"young men see visions & old men dream, dreams\" every thing, almost. lots of dreams, one man, Hall of Garland walked 9 miles with an angel, in a vision, many things revealed etc.\nJames', if the Judgment etc. is before the Millennium, what mean the thousand years after it is said that \"Time shall be no more,\"?\n\n    Mrs. Upham & Joseph have today started for Mass. to go in the Boat tomorrow. It is really astonishing how that woman has acted, and the State of matters between her and Mr. Cutler's family. She has not been in to Mr. Cutler's or spoke to any one of the family, even her own Sister, since I have been here for months before and that too, living in the same yard, passing constantly by the open doors & windows, perhaps seeing every member of the family 20 times in a day. The family all take great pains not to trouble or intrude upon them either by presence or words in any way. It must make Mrs. Cutler feel disagreeably, - her face shows it when she turns away her head as Mrs. Upham passes the open window where she is sitting. \n Mrs. U. has also taken me into favor in the same way. I believe, even been at the pains to circulate a few ? about me, although I have taken care not to offend her needlessly, at least, by sins of commission.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102079,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102079","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c84b314c9a0aa41d232e0b1d5c758c19.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c84b314c9a0aa41d232e0b1d5c758c19.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c84b314c9a0aa41d232e0b1d5c758c19.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c84b314c9a0aa41d232e0b1d5c758c19.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:46:17+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"c84b314c9a0aa41d232e0b1d5c758c19.jpg","authentication":"da9ccdbc3024ec1c5e0397f15260428d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_167_005_003_o2.jpg","size":1647810,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2372,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.06432335581787500256023548672601464204490184783935546875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040612"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040612"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040612"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c84b314c9a0aa41d232e0b1d5c758c19.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803514,"FileSize":1647810,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2372\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2372,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:20:40","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:06:12","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:06:12","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":57,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3100,"ExifImageLength":4703,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Tues. eve. Aug. 9th  I have just received Joseph's crowded letter, for which, 'all due thanks.'  I am - better this week. Did Charles work enough to pay his expenses? Did his work make him sick? why did not he tale a dose of Lobelia, or Hotdrops? what make yet behind with that leetle patch hoeing? Eliab why do not you look after those Michevous little foxes? So it appears that Joseph L.S. is fairly setting up for himself, is he 21 this summer or next?  Six month older or younger than I am? Is it a real \"they say\" about Mrs. Hamlin also? It struck me quite forcibly as a little queer: but on second thought perhaps it would be a very suitable match.\n\nI guess I shall not go a fishing quite yet. perhaps  the Barkers will not go. David is much better. Mark Barker is going off to Sea, though, right off, to Europe, probably.\n\nI guess I shall come home and get the Shirts,  perhaps before I send this letter.\nYou ask if I am going to be a Methodist. I believe I should have no objection to being called or being a Methodist, but I am not an Episcopalian. I admire & respect both the Methodists and their doctrines generally; it is true there are men, -?, unstable and imprudent, of more zeal than judgement  every where; and of course very many among the Methodists. but methodism, true Wesleyan Methodism- is extremely liberal, ready to yeild every thing and in every thing, except Christ and him crucified. That is the only tenet, which is the real 'sine qua non' of Methodism. It is not a quarrelsome or even sectarian sect; witness its relations with even the Church of England. I find no fault with either Methodist, Baptist, or Congregationalists on the score of doctrine. I have a faculty of harmonizing them all, as they are now held, by the most enlightened at least of each sect; but I dislike the constitution of form of Church government as it is called of one. and am very much opposed  to the Close communion of the Baptists, but even these distinctions are I hope, fast melting away. I see by the papers that a Cal. Bap. church in Amesbury, Mass. admits members with the privelege of communing with other Evangelical Churches.\n\n   Lysander wants much to know whether there are any blueberries this year, and when they will be ripe. He has a good deal to say about the 'going a blueberrying'; was much pleased with his visit to Milo last summer, I guess.\nI can not tell whether I shall come home this week or next or not till sometime later.

I almost fear I am a little too selfish to want you to leave your active employments, & especially your never ending hurry to write to me, who am here like a bee in a hive, midst of the 'riches of the mind,' with nothing to do but to study and read; albeit College is not considered a very happy place.'except by those who have left it.' and the desire to hear from home, and to know how every thing progresses at the old place, amounts, almost to a mania in some cases, at times.\n\nAlthough I have not heard from home yet, I could not forbear the temptation to write again, especially as Stevens intends to go home in a wee and I can send by him, at least as far as Foxcroft.   The Sabbath I believe is not generally considered by Students, as a very agreeable portion of time. They have to get up for prayers just the same, and are obliged to attend Church all day which is thought a real penance, and I am almost disposed to allow it. In the first place, the Students, are all obliged to sit together by classes in a gallery of the church, and the seats, are I believe without exception, the most uncomfortable I ever saw.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102083,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102083","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4c122ee3e0eb2136a64661ebafafc5a2.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4c122ee3e0eb2136a64661ebafafc5a2.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4c122ee3e0eb2136a64661ebafafc5a2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4c122ee3e0eb2136a64661ebafafc5a2.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:46:22+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"4c122ee3e0eb2136a64661ebafafc5a2.jpg","authentication":"a6b90a7d1e780120dcd32adc98e5527c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_168_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1677955,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2883,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053890462609679001815266019548289477825164794921875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040751"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040751"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040751"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4c122ee3e0eb2136a64661ebafafc5a2.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803514,"FileSize":1677955,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2883\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2883,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:20:55","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:07:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:07:51","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3173,"ExifImageLength":3961,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"And the preaching is almost as bad.

The Peucinian is the oldest, and, perhaps, the most influential; the Athenaean the most active, and, perhaps, the most prosperous. The number of the College Societies differ not much; the members of the Athenaean have, it is said, taken the most prizes lately.\n\n   The common amusement here is to do mischief, breaking windows is universal. You see all damage to College property is averaged and comes charged in every ones term bill, amounting usually to one or two $ per term apeice, for 150 or 200 students. One man is employed almost all the time in setting glass; the students call him a Prof. & say his professorship ought to be endowed. A, it costs, himself nothing, no one hesitates to throw an apple, an umbrella or a stove through a window, if it so please him. Sometimes the Freshmen windows are most all broken in a night. Kicking down doors is a favorite amusement with some. Every one would prefer to pay an average damage of $5. per term, rather than to inform. Canis Facultatis, or faculty dog, the name applied to informers, is the most opprobius epithet known. Some of the better part of the Students express their disapprobation of such state freely, but no one dares break through it. The first of this term, the dome & steeply of the College Chapel was sawed & thrown off one dark night. The faculty have made extraordinary efforts to discover the perpetrators! Every Student has been called up & cross questioned about it to no purpose., & it will probably be perhaps 100, in the average bill. I dont know how many knew who did it. Luckily I did not.\n\nI wish you would send papers to me weekly, I cant get any to send, have none here. I mean to take one next term.

Jan. 12th, 1845\n\nI was really gratified last Friday night, Jan. 8th, at receiving a very first rate letter, or rather letters, from Home. Aron Hill called at the schoolhouse; just before school was done and left them.\n\n By the way Aron looked as good natured & clever as you please, appeared glad to see me, and offered to carry up any thing I wanted to send up home. I intended then to write a letter to send up by him, but as it was an evening of the Writing School and more over my eyes were a little sore I did not make out to write.\n   The letters did me more good than any thing this great while. Especially the History of \"Joseph's doings with the Milo Sup. S. Com.\" which was enough to keep a man from hypocondria for a month even if much more disposed to it than I ever was.\n The result I think likely will do Joseph, & his scholars, some good, but perhaps Chadbourne & Macomber more.\n  There is no trouble about Joseph getting along in any such condition, or in any situation where has to do only with his own sex.

I have also sold one doz. writing books, at the enormous profit of one cent each, being at that as much cheaper than the stores usual price.\n I bought one 1\/2 ream of paper for $1.25 and one for .90, and sold one fourth of each to Green who boards here for $.75. Ann bought 12 sheets like the best, at Duren's since she came down and gave .15 for it,, 30 per quire. $6.00 per ream.\n   About a fortnight ago, I started Friday night, Jan 3d and walked up to Levant; about 7 miles, after school, and staid both Sat. and Sunday at Dr. Case's.

(and the way I have had the 'Blues' since I have been here is by no means slow, considering that it is me, who am not often troubled with such sort of critters, you know.  However, let me tell you the whole history since I left Home.  When I started I waited awhile for Severance  and then went on. down to Bradford & there waited. Severance got along there at most 3 oclock, and stopped to bait?, Said he should go down to Merritt that night, and in early in the morning.  I got a chance to ride down to Merritt ( and went on Got to M Dudley's in the eve. The next morning I waited & waited till I was tired, for Severance to come so I might get my trunks ready etc. At noon Walked in to the City, and streets in snow & mud the rest of the time. Bought a Cloak, pair pants, & Vest,  of Oliver Dresser & Co. for $16.00. The vest was 1,25, or 1,00. The Pants 4,50 or 4,00. The cloak was perhaps a little better than those I found at other places for 13,00 to 15,00, the same sold last fall for 16,00 to 18,00.  You see it is not the season for Cloaks to sell, & every one was anxious to sell. This one had been worn a few times, but just as good, price $15.00\n\nI have repented that I bought so valuable one, for I could not at all afford it any how. though it seemed somehow necessary to my 'doing.'\nI expected Severance all that day with the greatest impatience. He might at least have sent the trunk along by Cutts.   Severance arrived the day after, Thursday, March 6th, at 10 1\/2 oclock. So I could not leave Bangor till Friday.  The Stage starts at 4 A.M., but the rascally waiter waked me up before 3 instead, so I slept only three hours.\n\nThe travelling was very bad. Stage went on wheels all the way, but some of the way, over the Diamont hills etc. the snow was drifted much much of the way, Muddy, terrible rough & icy besides some times","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102103,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102103","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/79218ed51f4bd40cbb23e385840c0a05.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/79218ed51f4bd40cbb23e385840c0a05.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/79218ed51f4bd40cbb23e385840c0a05.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/79218ed51f4bd40cbb23e385840c0a05.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:46:48+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"79218ed51f4bd40cbb23e385840c0a05.jpg","authentication":"0f0bf9282df04ba696b2ee58d5478afc","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_168_006_002_o2.jpg","size":1656429,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2928,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0523815080449299974585386507897055707871913909912109375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040946"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040946"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["040946"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"79218ed51f4bd40cbb23e385840c0a05.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803515,"FileSize":1656429,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2928\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2928,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:21:45","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:09:46","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:09:46","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3203,"ExifImageLength":3938,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The stage was $3.00 to Augusta 10 miles, and $2,00 from there to Brunswick. 30 miles which is 50 more than I expected, and outrageously too high.\n\n I rode all the way to Augusta in a single wagon. The regular Coach was more than full, and so they took a wagon beside. They had good smart horses, and changed them every 10 or 12 miles like the Stage, it was more pleasant than inside the Stage, but perhaps more tiresome, as the wagon was not a very east one, and most of the at three in it, & fast riding.\nI did not have time at Augusta, even to see the State house, hardly any thing else. The travelling was so bad that we did not get to Bruns. till 11 + oclock, instead od 9, so had to stay at tavern. Stage fare 5,00, Foods, lodgings etc. about $1,00 more. So you see I arrived here less than $40,00.!\n\nof which I was owing my Chum, you know, about 5,00. My board in the Club I have paid $6,00. Furniture things bought last fall & Postage and so forth I have paid 2 or 3 dolls.  So you cant tell how poor I am. I have not seen my term bill yet, it will probably be about $24, or 25,00 besides the years tuition $24,00, which I suppose I shall be obliged to pay whether or no. However, for some consolation hereafter, it has been afixed to me to take charge of one of the Recitation Rooms which will for a remuneration $10.00, though I have to pay one of my Classmates for taking it till I arrived. As the furnace is now broken it is just to keep fire in one room. Coal is used though, which is dirty. Have to build the fire about 5 oclock I suppose.\n\n The worst of it all is that I arrived here Friday night at 11 oclock on the same night of the Society Initiations, just a day behind the fair. which am a real Scrape.

I received a large double letter from Milo, and another similar one from Bangor. I had been anxiously expecting letters for some time. There were more than twelve full pages in the two letters.\nYou say, Dear Mother, that you do not have so much to write about as one away from home so far. If you only thought how interesting any thing and any thing coming from home, when one is so far away, you would fine there is enough to write about. And if you knew how beloved your letters always are, you would never think it not worth while to write them.\nYou want to know what kind of a man my present superior Mr. Field is. Alfred R. Field Esq. is one of the Northfield Fields. I believe I have already written something about him. He is thought considerable of about here. Cousin Joseph especially likes him much. But I do not like him very well. I suppose he considers himself a Unitarian, but he is rather one of the Ultra, Radical sort. a great admirer & follower of Theodore Parker. and R.W. Emerson. A Radical Temperance & Abolition man. as well as in religious matters. I call him almost an Infidel. though.

The Unitarians  here can never do much, there is so much done for them.  Old Pomroy, I believe his name was, a rich old rascal long ago, built a fine Church, and set apart a sufficient fund to support abundantly a clergyman to preach Harvard Theology. People have nothing to do but go and hear him preach, and keep up old Pomroy's restrictions. The Orthodox Clergyman., Mr. Jones has been to Persia as a Missionary. did not succeed they say.

Aunt Conant, I only saw one day, I was up there when I first came hereabouts. Cousin Maria is at home, only she is here at Northfield this week.

I do very much like the man's preaching; plain, practical, common sense; very little imagination, or eloquence, straight forward ideas, argument thoughts; and talked right off, not read. After all preaching a sermon is better than reading one like Wm. S. Sewall, Geo E Adams, and most others. Let a man study his subject & sermon just as much, or rather a little more, have it at his command: notes perhaps but not confined to them, their loss not stop him); and then have the faculty, and train it, and perfect it, of putting forth his ideas in words, as he needs them.

But a sermon ought not, to take effort, to be read. Whatsoever others may do, New Englanders will not now as their fathers did, or as perhaps Scotchmen will now, sit an hour or two hours to hear a man read an dry (musty I almost said), theological argument. They may sit the Modern half hour; even for that short time, really hear! not one in ten, as far as any observation or experience goes. To interest people, to make them hear you, you must talk to them, reason with them, speak to them, not read at them, or as many do merely read in the house where they sit.  It was my utter, absolute incapability of doing this, of talking, speaking to people that convinced me that I ought not, could not, be a Minister. Even if my heart & my head were full- my tongue would be lacking. I should have nothing to say, that is, no words to say it in. I feel this to be my exceeding great infirmity, and I believe it grows upon me. Perhaps my circumstances are not very favorable to the cultivation of whatever slight faculty of speech I may possibly possess. At College, among so many having the same thoughts & feelings, bound & affected by the same circumstances and influences, within & without, I could of course contrive to express the common stock of ideas, or let others express them for me, so as to get along after some decent fashion.  In the circles of domestic life, among old tried intimate, perfectly acquainted friends, I think likely it might be the same. but among strangers, or more casual acquaintances, all whose thought, feelings, sentiments, ideas & sensations even, are different from my own, I find it almost impossible to speak even as much as the forms of society require, even to answer civil questions decently.\nI declare what an essay I have been writing here. Lets see, what was I writing about? O Thanksgiving! I would have procured a team & gone over to Royalston that day, if I could have managed to procure an invitation.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102110,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102110","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8460ed3cd9e005019e142888102caee6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8460ed3cd9e005019e142888102caee6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8460ed3cd9e005019e142888102caee6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8460ed3cd9e005019e142888102caee6.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:46:57+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"8460ed3cd9e005019e142888102caee6.jpg","authentication":"bdb20d8e18e7a5348654bca7d5518981","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_169_001_005_o2.jpg","size":1824979,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2910,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05806856942853499958800966851413249969482421875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041055"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041055"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041055"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8460ed3cd9e005019e142888102caee6.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803515,"FileSize":1824979,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2910\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2910,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:22:05","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:10:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:10:55","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":76,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3252,"ExifImageLength":4023,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I really want to go over there but I do not know when I shall.

You see Engineers all going off from here on the Mountain Survey, hardly any one was left who could do any thing. They found out I could use a scale & dividers, and in fact I have been in the Office most all the time since we came from Putney. Should not be surprised from present appearances, if I were kept here in the Office now all the time this Winter.  On some accounts, perhaps it will be better for me. I shall get to be quite a Topographical Draftsman. It may be less wearing than constant Exposure to all weathers, though more constant. day & evening. I find I shall feel the cold more when I am out. If I had kept right on out all the time I believe I should have felt the need of no additional clothing, over coat, under shirts, even a vest, all winter.

It seems to me I could convince him, if I had him here, that one acre of than Intervale rightly used was worth more than any other five acres he has; perhaps as Milo taxes are than the whole the rest. I should like to show him these intervale lands along the Connecticut River; have him examine the lands, their prices, their crops. If these lands are now valued at from one to two hundred dollars per acre: sell quick at that. This you will remember too is - until the Rail Roads are built - farther from Market that you are at Milo. - And most richly are they worth those prices, when compared with the upland farms, at any price. Suppose two farms, producing with good cultivation the same. It makes a great difference with the profits, and with the real value of the farms, whether the cost of cultivation is 99\/100 & more, or 9\/100 the value of the crop. But you will say that these Conn. River intervales are much richer naturally than yours. I do not believe it. I dare you to prove it - by testing yours with equal cultivation.\nOne thing for the Intervales here. Hoof of grazing beast, horse, cattle, sheep or hog, never touches them. They will produce prime crops without Stable Manure indeed. Why the Full growth of Grass left on them every year is worth more than any manuring you ever gave your land two years in succession. But they do manure these lands. The secret is not that they need no Manure but that every ounce of Manure instead of washing away as it does from every upland acre into every brook & valley, stays there.\nYour intervale may be by mismangement run out but if I wanted to make farming profitable, it would be by a dozen acres of that, rather than by any upland farm in Milo. And Public opinion, not in Milo, but throughout the valley of the Conn. would sustain my estimate.

I wish I had your oxen here; that is if you want to sell them. Or your horse either. Teams, of all kinds are extremely hight about here, occasioned partly perhaps by the demand for labor along the Rail roads. Any decent yoke of oxen will bring one hundred dollars, or a decent horse.  This Railroad building every one to work that will work; increases the demand and consequently the price for every thing. All sorts of lumber, and even wood, is almost doubled in price.\nI believe I wrote you a long story a while ago about your Intervale lands. I want to tell you something else whereby perhaps a comparison of your experience with that o those who know the management of such lands for a century may be beneficial.

I believe it is in the South West corner of Goffstown or perhaps \"West Goffstown\". New Hampshire. If not within the limits of West Goffstown, it must be in \"West Boston\", or in \"East Ware.\" The place is called \"Parkers,\" and it is very near a Post Office called \"Oil Mill Village\". Perhaps it is enough that it is on or near the line of the New  \"New Hampshire Central Rail Road,\" so called; whereof I begin to suspect that I am, or am like to be an Engineer.\nThere, that will do for a preamble!\nWell. Yesterday was Saturday, but I did not get home last night, not even to Bangor, although I very much expected first of the week that I should. I thought I would not write that I was coming home; and so take you somewhat by surprise; but now I do not know when I may get a chance to go.\nI got through on the Vermont & Mass. R.R. about the 15th  or 17th Inst. For a week or two before I got through, I had little to do but ride round on the Rail Road, perhaps be down at Fitchburg every day, settling up & arranging matters with the Contractors with whom I had to do to Fitchburg, be there in \"business hours\" and go back at night! Ride one hundred or one hundred & fifty miles per day.\nI went to Royalston and spent one Sabbath, March11th. Folks pretty well there. Uncle same as ever. His new wife is a large fine looking woman, I do not judge however that she is in every respect a quite Equal to his last wife. Samuel is at home, and apparently doing nothing. He is a little inclined to be one, of that large class of \"Soured Men\"","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102121,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102121","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/44790c7732d5967fc97e839c2dc747ab.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/44790c7732d5967fc97e839c2dc747ab.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/44790c7732d5967fc97e839c2dc747ab.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/44790c7732d5967fc97e839c2dc747ab.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:47:12+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"44790c7732d5967fc97e839c2dc747ab.jpg","authentication":"461335707544470c17505df78cf432ad","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_169_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1720925,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2842,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.056067877342508003202237176765265758149325847625732421875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041244"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041244"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041244"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"44790c7732d5967fc97e839c2dc747ab.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803516,"FileSize":1720925,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2842\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2842,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:22:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:12:44","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:12:44","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3196,"ExifImageLength":4048,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"2\nHe has been disappointed, unfortunate, & affected, perhaps.

He feels poor, and that he has done enough for other people & their children, I suppose. He says he will try to get places for the children, if he cannot; it is just as belongs to the other Grand parent to support them.  Old Mr. Jacobs who refuses to have any thing to do about it, unless compelled by Law. Strange some one out of so large a family cannot take those children, and bring them up. The thought struck me that Mrs. John Cutter of Exeter was the  very one, who could and ought to take one of those children. Do you suppose she would?  It is strange what a family that was.

R.R. who with his wife are particular friends of mine. Thence I was going to Portland and to see if there was any prospect for me in any of the Maine Rail Roads.\n\nAfter some hesitation, I decided it did seem like throwing away a few dollars of expenses, I would come out and see Mr. Chase.

Arriving at Parker's Friday night, I was obliged to be in Manchester on Saturday, and my time both day and evening was pretty fully occupied.  This morning I started by the early train in haste to get home tomorrow, for I have not heard one word from my brother since I left Bangor, now about a month ago. We had a very pleasant journey to Newport and back. I started with John Parker, but rode part of the way in company with Mr. Steele and others of the Rail Road Directors to point out to them the Route and Line of our Survey which the others were unacquainted with. They all seemed to think it quite essential that I should remain to attend to the Location and construction of this part of the Road. I had on the way some delightful visions of a snug little cottage in one of those quiet villages, made happy by a sweet and loving wife, as my home and Earthly Paradise for a year or two at least.\n I spent thirty six hours in Newport, much of it in explaining to members the proposed Rail Road Route, with the Plan, and the Estimates of the Report, with which I was of course more familiar than any one else. In this way I performed my part rather better and more profitably than by an attempt at set speeches.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102137,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102137","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3cc2fcc53dabc645d7c73515d26ab516.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3cc2fcc53dabc645d7c73515d26ab516.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3cc2fcc53dabc645d7c73515d26ab516.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3cc2fcc53dabc645d7c73515d26ab516.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:47:33+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"3cc2fcc53dabc645d7c73515d26ab516.jpg","authentication":"33b2f503d4579fbd1dd76cc128daf585","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_173_003_002_o2.jpg","size":1811689,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2853,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05879739974815299807797686071353382430970668792724609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041631"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041631"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041631"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3cc2fcc53dabc645d7c73515d26ab516.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803517,"FileSize":1811689,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2853\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2853,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:23:34","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:16:31","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:16:31","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3122,"ExifImageLength":3939,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The day Thursday was a very unfavorable one for the Meeting at Newport.

March 17. 1850\nDear Antoinette\n\n             Your kind letter was joyfully received a day or two since. I was indeed glad to hear from you, that you were still well and happy. I did not get your letter until more than a week after it was mailed, on account of my change of place. My sick brother has moved here, where one elder brother resides, and where Mother makes it her home mostly.  If he remains as at present he will probably spend the Summer here. I wish of course to be with him as  much as possible, and shall probably remain here most of the time while I am at leisure. My poor Joseph does not get better. He can walk about the room a little, a cane in one hand, and taking hold of some one with the other, but can hardly get over a hearth, rug or an ordinary threshold between rooms. We wheel him about from one room to another in a large Easy chair with three wheels, or I take him up in my arms and carry him about as one would a child. What an affliction it is for a young man; one too of such ambition, such activity,  and such prospects of success. It seems indeed cutting one off from life in the midst of his days. It is wonderful how well he bears it and commands himself; always perfectly uncomplaining. cheerful, even merry. I spend the time mostly in reading, studying, and talking with him, varying it occasionally by a game of Chess or a promenade through the house. I should never tire of his society and conversation.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102141,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102141","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ebf40853eab675de30d712756611f124.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ebf40853eab675de30d712756611f124.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ebf40853eab675de30d712756611f124.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ebf40853eab675de30d712756611f124.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:47:39+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"ebf40853eab675de30d712756611f124.jpg","authentication":"6cf7532e3c28e2efdee548c9123f0d88","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_173_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1689051,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2915,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053651324566419002215500455577057437039911746978759765625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041655"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041655"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041655"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ebf40853eab675de30d712756611f124.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803517,"FileSize":1689051,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2915\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2915,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:23:44","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:16:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:16:55","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3174,"ExifImageLength":3919,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I have been here a little more than a week; came here a week ago last Saturday.

The Congregational Church is very small and weak; only two acting, resident Male Members, and perhaps half a dozen females. Several of the Older Members have died within a few years, and all the younger ones moved away. The Males are both Old Men. No preaching. Yet they keep up their regular meetings, Society meetings they call them; and really interesting meetings they are too. Some of the Baptists usually come in with them. The Meetings, by the way, are held in a school house, or the Sons of Temperance Hall. Old Deacon Lee  a gentleman of much intelligence and education, formerly of wealth and political influence, and now I think one of the very best of Men, conducts the meetings with a dignity, propriety and fervency rarely seen; calling however upon some one of the younger men present. having lost in some measure his own voice and strength, to read the sermon, usually selected from the National Preacher; at any rate always a very excellent one. When I am present, as I have been for two Sabbaths now, the Old gentleman calls upon me to read. I do like to read before that little audience. I am really interested in these meetings. They must be beneficial. I cannot but think that God will sometime bless this little Church, feeble and afflicted as they have been.

I do not think I have communed with this Church more than two or three times since I joined it; although I have never been in situation to remove my connection to any other Church. This I think has been injurious o me; attending meeting from Church to Church, and hardly feeling at home any where. The care and watchfulness of one's brethren are always needed by a young man. I suppose we all need the good influences exerted upon us by the Society and communion of the good.\n  I believe I need a gentle companion, kind and good, whose constant influence, restraining from ill and prompting to all good, shall be a daily sunshine, gladdening and fertilizing my heart.  Such a companion I hope now to have as soon as I can get my self regularly established in some convenient position.\n  I have yet heard nothing decisive from the New Hampshire Central, and it is yet uncertain where I shall go, or where I shall be this coming season. I do hope the N.H. Central will be able to go forward and complete their Road. It must be pleasanter and better for me in almost every respect. I certainly do not want to have to go out of New England for Employment.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102143,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102143","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/53636f71081730acda622ceb8875878b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/53636f71081730acda622ceb8875878b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/53636f71081730acda622ceb8875878b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/53636f71081730acda622ceb8875878b.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:47:42+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"53636f71081730acda622ceb8875878b.jpg","authentication":"e219347b2fb390cf6f7c676bb0e50fd2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_173_004_004_o2.jpg","size":1564145,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2895,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05002702616260500112499443048363900743424892425537109375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041703"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041703"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041703"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"53636f71081730acda622ceb8875878b.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803517,"FileSize":1564145,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2895\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2895,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:23:49","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:17:03","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:17:03","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":63,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3175,"ExifImageLength":3947,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"There are openings in different directions, none to be sure exactly suiting me; but I do not want to decide definitely until they come to come conclusion about the N.H.

It seems you have now been teaching in Goffstown for four weeks. It is quite a large school too it appears, much large than I supposed they could raise in that District.  I am afraid it will fatigue you too much. Hardly any thing is more wearing than school teaching to one to one who really feels its great responsibilities. You must remember that even as a school teacher you owe paramount duties to your self, to preserve your own health and strength unimpaired. We may sometimes be too apt to forget that, where we see clearly our duties to others.\n  I should think you might have quite a pleasant school in that neighborhood, although I am not much acquainted except with the Parkers. I always found though that there were unpleasant as well as pleasant things in every school. There will be some cases where our best efforts to benefit seem to fail, and we are pained to see our labor in vain. The pleasure however of seeing good seed springing up and bearing fruit in one mind will however repay one for many disappointments.\n  My time has been passing very quietly here, enlivened a little lately, perhaps saddened, by the prospect of leaving soon.

I have felt a good deal for him.; he has many trials and discouragements. He told me once he thought there was not much sympathy of feeling between him and his people. I really do not think he has a very encouraging field of labor.  I hope that the people of Milo are to have some preaching this Summer.

Will you not some days sympathize with the little ones when they play truant? \"To continue ten or eleven weeks\" Well I hope it will be the last of your school teaching.\n\n  I thank you for remembering and thinking of our little meetings at Milo. Fortunately I am no longer called upon to supply the place of a Minister. A young man, a student in the Bangor Theological Seminary is now here, spending his vacation in Milo, as a Missionary.\nI hope he may be the means of doing much good.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102150,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102150","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7af467c23c49b3f2452bd52e68f26291.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7af467c23c49b3f2452bd52e68f26291.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7af467c23c49b3f2452bd52e68f26291.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7af467c23c49b3f2452bd52e68f26291.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:47:51+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"7af467c23c49b3f2452bd52e68f26291.jpg","authentication":"ed7849289a3b7d533e96a6d2d9508070","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_173_006_003_o2.jpg","size":1729110,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2861,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05596042564759799720075506002103793434798717498779296875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041753"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041753"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041753"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7af467c23c49b3f2452bd52e68f26291.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803518,"FileSize":1729110,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2861\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2861,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:24:06","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:17:53","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:17:53","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3145,"ExifImageLength":3956,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"He is but just beginning to preach, but I think may make a very useful man.

We hope he is really doing good here. but we must feel, that it is of comparatively little account who plants, or who waters; it is God alone who must give the increase. The soil here is perhaps unpropitious. It has been run over first by Methodism, And then by the Wild fires of the \"Christian connection\" and Millerism in various forms.

June 30. 1850\nDear Antoinette\n\n                 Your letter was welcomed more than two weeks since. I intended to write before this time, but various matters in addition to my constant care of my brother have occupied my attention, and delayed it somewhat.\n\nSister Lucy I wrote to you was sick of a fever, and Mother went to Bangor to take care of her. As soon as Lucy was able to ride, she came up here with her husband and stayed a week, returning yesterday.  We enjoyed their visit very much, although Lucy was well enough to sit up only a part of the time. I think a sister never was more beloved than is ours. Joseph says that the best people in the world are not in Milo today. I believe he thinks they were yesterday.\nJoseph remains just about the same.

It is nearly ten miles from here, but it appeared the best thing I could do, though I could have found a Baptist meeting within five miles in another direction, and Universalist much nearer. I was a little disappointed in the preaching though. I expected to hear Old Mr. Woods, a regular old school preacher, sound and old-fashioned-ly learned. I really like to hear him preach. But a young man, who is about to be settled as Colleague to Mr. Woods, preached, and as I thought not so well.\nI am very anxious to hear from your brother, and I hope soon to hear from you that he is much better, and moreover that neither yourself or you Mother have made yourselves sick in taking care of him.  I should perhaps in my anxiety to hear from your brother & yourself have written before if I could have found time. You can hardly imagine how busily I am employed or how great a weight of care and responsibility I have upon me.\n\nWe breakfast at five.

Aug. 11. 1850\n\nDear Antoinette\n\n     Your kind letter was received with much pleasure more than a week since. I intended to write before this time, but have been unable to. My time, from quite early in the morning until about dark, is spent in the field. The evenings are quite short, but must be spent, perhaps lengthened out somewhat, with two or three to help me in \"Office Work\", calculations, drafting etc.  So that my time is entirely occupied. Moreover, though abundant showers to wet us occasionally there have been no rainy days, no day when we did not work out of doors, since we have been here. So that I have really no time to write letters except on the Sabbath, therefore I do not write letters except after I get home from Church, one every week to brother Joseph, and perhaps one or two in the evening to yourself and my Mother or sisters. I have a good distance to go to Church besides; out to Newport. The distance is less however today than before, for we moved our boarding place yesterday, from the End of the Lake in Newbury up to \"Angels\" in Sunapee. \"Sunapee\" is a new name for the town. It was changed from Wendall to Sunapee this summer. I still however have my letters my letters directed to Newbury. as we shall be here probably but a little while, and can get any thing very readily from Newbury.\n\nWe shall soon be out at Newport for a few weeks and then back again to Newbury & Bradford.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102161,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102161","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ab72186d9864ff747c8b96a0dfdfcbcd.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ab72186d9864ff747c8b96a0dfdfcbcd.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ab72186d9864ff747c8b96a0dfdfcbcd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ab72186d9864ff747c8b96a0dfdfcbcd.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:48:06+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"ab72186d9864ff747c8b96a0dfdfcbcd.jpg","authentication":"c610b389022d78e87183ec458407372b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_173_009_002_o2.jpg","size":1776862,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2826,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05821806767843600016743010883146780543029308319091796875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041925"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041925"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["041925"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ab72186d9864ff747c8b96a0dfdfcbcd.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803518,"FileSize":1776862,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2826\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2826,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:24:35","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:19:25","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:19:25","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3167,"ExifImageLength":4033,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"You say I must be careful of my health.

I always try very hard to get things all business a little earlier than usual on Saturday evenings. It is a habit I learned at Northfield and there about in Massachusetts, where many of the people commence their Sabbath at Sunset on Saturday Evening.\n This evening I have finished up, and put away my Field Books and Profiles before eight oclock. To be sure I was then very much tempted to go \"'Coon hunting\" The Mountains near us {it seems almost over the house,} abounds with Raccoons, and this beautiful moonlight evening their shrill hoot or whistle is heard to much advantage from the open window near which I am seated. I have never tried \"Coon hunting\", and had really considerable curiosity in that line. But there were some adverse circumstances in way of the sport.  to say nothing of the rough precipitous boulder covered hill sides upon which it must be prosecuted; and I soon decided upon the more quiet pleasure; though I have just been listening to one or two 'Coon' & ' Possum' stories pretty well told under my window by one of my men who spend several years at the South and West.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102169,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102169","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/1ebfe020d58a43fcc1041a560f44deb0.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/1ebfe020d58a43fcc1041a560f44deb0.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/1ebfe020d58a43fcc1041a560f44deb0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1ebfe020d58a43fcc1041a560f44deb0.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:48:16+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"1ebfe020d58a43fcc1041a560f44deb0.jpg","authentication":"154433c4ecf7f434dddbf09c17aa05c8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_173_011_002_o2.jpg","size":1657473,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2858,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053698293289790997862009902519275783561170101165771484375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["042036"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["042036"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["042036"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1ebfe020d58a43fcc1041a560f44deb0.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803519,"FileSize":1657473,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2858\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2858,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:24:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:20:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:20:36","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3159,"ExifImageLength":3978,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"We are now boarding at an old Farmer's, a hard headed old fellow, who has dug out from among the rocks a valuable farm, in a little recess here among the Mountains, with their steep rocky sides stretching up apparently indefinitely in almost two sides\nOur R.R.

I was much pleased with the perfectly simple dignity, of his manner and style. Entirely free from Affectation so common in young men, and yet a natural consciousness of strength.

This place is almost heathenish. Here is quite a village for a country place, or rather two villages half a mile apart. There are two taverns, half a dozen stores, mills etc.; and likely to be two Railroads. One would expect two or three Churches at least. There is one miserable looking Meeting house, half way between the villages, but no minister: some sort of Baptist or 'Christian' preaching one half or one third of the time, and even then nobody hardly attends.  Today a strange Millerite, or Second Advent preacher, he called himself, from somewhere, held forth and part of the day at least drew large crowds of eager Audition, hoping to hear some new thing.

It was really painful to hear the way in which he used scripture to support his theories. Sometimes one could hardly avoid being amused, in spite of the impiety I had almost said. Among other things I remember he entered into an argument upon Presdestination, or God's decrees. \"Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel, and foreknowledge of God etc.\"\n'I will allow the foreknowledge of God,\" said he, but the determinate counsel, he thought {or labored long to prove} was the Council or Sanhedrin of the Jews, firmly determined to put Christ to death! You will not thank me for that idea perhaps. But is it not sad to reflect upon the effect produced by such preaching. If it has any effect it must make people think that any thing can be proved from the scriptures, few being able to detect the fallacies of such arguments as many of them, and finally it must lessen or destroy all faith. I believe it has had that effect in many cases. It seems to have burned over the hearts of the people in some places like a wild fire, destroying the very roots of all religious feeling.\nI was almost inclined to think today that some of my men who wish always to spend the Sabbath away in the woods, or climbing some mountain, might really spend it better than in hearing such preaching.

I have been for a fortnight past both wishing and expecting an opportunity to get to Dunbarton and yesterday felt really a good deal disappointed.\n\nTwo weeks ago Friday I came down to Manchester and Goffstown, and though to spend the Sabbath at Dunbarton, but found myself obliged to return to Bradford on Saturday.  The next week I was at Concord two or three days attending a \"Hearing\" before the Rail Road Commission, in which the N.H. Central was vitally interested.\nConcord seemed so near Dunbarton that I wanted to get there, but could not get away either day or evening. When we got through at Concord, I had to return to Bradford to finish up my business there. Saturday afternoon I came down to Manchester again, but it rained so much that I was obliged to stay and spend the Sabbath. It was the first Sabbath I ever spent in Manchester! The past week I have been preparing \"Estimates\" of the amount of work and cost of building our route from Henniker to Newport. which Estimates are to be ready before the next meeting of the R.R. Commissioners Nov. 13.\nI did think to get away yesterday afternoon, but the only consolation left for my disappointment is the opportunity of writing today. Perhaps a letter from you may be somewhere on the way for me now. When I left Bradford I expected to go to \"Parker's\" to do this Office Work, and directed my letters remailed thither.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102177,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102177","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ea9724c76565caee063f7a229d676d73.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ea9724c76565caee063f7a229d676d73.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ea9724c76565caee063f7a229d676d73.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ea9724c76565caee063f7a229d676d73.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:48:27+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"ea9724c76565caee063f7a229d676d73.jpg","authentication":"65d6a0213b5234e8e5dc81d615044c55","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_173_013_002_o2.jpg","size":1657121,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2822,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0543717681182250001103994918594253249466419219970703125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["042156"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["042156"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["042156"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ea9724c76565caee063f7a229d676d73.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803519,"FileSize":1657121,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2822\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2822,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:25:15","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:21:56","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:21:56","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3145,"ExifImageLength":4012,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I expect now to be at liberty before many weeks.

My mind is so full of 'RailRoad' all the week, that, without constant watchfulness, it will revert to the same topic even at times when it ought to be otherwise employed. Did you ever have your thoughts so long bent and fixed upon a single subject that it seemed to become a sort of natural channel for them? like a crooked spring the elasticity is all one way. I sometimes think of this. Perhaps it is in some measure necessary in almost any employment, any employment of the mind at least, but at any rate it ought not to be permitted to interfere with our proper attention to higher concerns and eternal interests.\n\nToday in my second Sabbath in Manchester, I was in Manchester a good deal last year but never happened to stay here over the Sabbath. I hear Mr. Wallace preach, and like him very much. I was much pleased with his Sermons last Sabbath. I think he must be a large Minded Man, and one who might safely be called Eloquent at times. I have thought though from some things in his manner and style that he might have lacked some of the things which go to form a thorough education.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102178,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102178","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/85f90d512073b74c6abe6d86c8db362f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/85f90d512073b74c6abe6d86c8db362f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/85f90d512073b74c6abe6d86c8db362f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/85f90d512073b74c6abe6d86c8db362f.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:48:28+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"85f90d512073b74c6abe6d86c8db362f.jpg","authentication":"e4584ba713f0ecedc5c38d5fef3273b0","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_173_013_003_o2.jpg","size":1599069,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2820,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05250423561859700327669742137004504911601543426513671875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["042159"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["042159"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["042159"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"85f90d512073b74c6abe6d86c8db362f.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803519,"FileSize":1599069,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2820\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2820,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:25:18","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:21:59","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:21:59","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":77,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3112,"ExifImageLength":3972,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"This forenoon his subject was \"The Church\", the text was Off I forget thee O Jersulem etc.\"\u00a0; And at times he was really Eloquent, as he dwelt upon the past sufferings & trials of the Church, its Excellencies, benefits, to the world, its standing, and its hopes. I have never heard any other minister of Manchester.\n\n  I have not told you how I was disappointed about seeing my Sister, Sister Anne, who has been in Wisconsin for two years. She was coming home, and wrote to me that if I would be in Boston Saturday night I would meet her. It was two weeks ago yesterday. Being at Manchester I did not get the letter until I got back to Bradford. If I had received it in season I should have tried hard to go down. I wanted to see her very much, and perhaps if I had known it in season might have gone down to Boston by the evening train, Spent the Sabbath there, and returned by the early train Monday morning.\n However if we get through here soon, which now appears probable, I can go \"Down East\", and see her there, and my brother too, whom I am getting quite impatient to see again, especially as he remains so much the same. I am afraid that he is not really getting any better. They write to me that he seems stronger and better in some subjects, but does not appear to regain the use of his limbs. His hands and arms are exactly as weak and helpless as they were last Spring. One of them he can not use at all, and even the other he can with difficulty raise up to his head. Now I do want to see him!\n\nThere I fear I shall be late to Church. You must write to me here, and I hope too you will see me soon at Dunbarton. Sincerely yours  I.S.

I am here in Bangor attending a RailRoad Meeting and with little time to write, but think I must if it be but little.\n\nThe Meeting here is for the organization of the Penobscot and Kennebec R.R. Co. Choice of Directorship. I thought it best to be present and have applied for a situation as Engineer; but there is very little probability of my obtaining it. There are too many applicants men more known, with more influence to favor them, and various advantages more than I can claim. Though to be sure, {you know how much one's self love influences the judgment} I could not help thinking that some of the Office seekers where real character and ability I know something of, might in fact be no more capable of rendering valuable service than myself.\nThere is little chance of my getting employment here, and I may be out of business for a long time. On some accounts I can hardly regret it, though I suppose I ought to be at work. I should like to spend the winter with my brother, if convenient. I hardly know whether to say he is better or worse. In many respects he seems better than when I left.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102182,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102182","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f263bb4e7205778a8eba35fbc13319e8.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f263bb4e7205778a8eba35fbc13319e8.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f263bb4e7205778a8eba35fbc13319e8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f263bb4e7205778a8eba35fbc13319e8.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T22:48:33+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:47:03+00:00","filename":"f263bb4e7205778a8eba35fbc13319e8.jpg","authentication":"64e2f4b4cfc9d85e7da099b8338b8f2c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_173_015_002_o2.jpg","size":1637424,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2773,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05467484072604900102732017330708913505077362060546875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["042230"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["042230"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180726"],"TimeCreated":["042230"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f263bb4e7205778a8eba35fbc13319e8.jpg","FileDateTime":1595803519,"FileSize":1637424,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2773\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2773,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:25:30","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:26 04:22:30","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:26 04:22:30","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3048,"ExifImageLength":3956,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1277","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"him last Summer; he is less easily fatigued, sit up nearly all the time, and bears excitement or motion better.

However I have the advice of the other Engineers, so I shall be in no danger of getting all the credit, if I succeed. I do not know what permanent arrangements will be made probably none till after this month. Perhaps I have about as good chance for getting some permanent employment on the Line as most of the many who are now temporarily employed, or who are applicants.

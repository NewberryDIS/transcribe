He received a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s from the University of Chicago sometime between 1868 and 1871, later attaining a master\u2019s from Chicago and a Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) from Ewing College. He married Elizabeth Ann Winegar in 1871 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, one of the cities in which he served as pastor. In 1877, he became a minister at Belden Avenue Baptist Church of Chicago. Following about 10 years in Chicago, he became a notable national temperance lecturer. In his later years, he lived in Boston and Newburyport, Massachusetts. He passed away in 1920 in his birthplace of Rushford. Most of the materials here consist of Taylor\u2019s sermons in various stages, from outlines to final drafts. Topics covered tend to be fairly conventional religious subjects with somewhat scholarly inflections. The sermons appear to come from a period prior to his days as a national temperance lecturer and therefore rarely focus on alcohol. However, the miscellaneous documents in the second series do extend to the late 1880s and early 1890s and therefore include some advertisements (in the form of a broadside and handbills) of his temperance lectures, as well as a letter from the Prohibitionist Samuel D. Hastings. <a href=\"https:\/\/mms.newberry.org\/xml\/xml_files\/TaylorE.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<\/a>","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":41,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/41","name":"Description","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Elbert Ozial Taylor writings, circa 1880s","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":50,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/50","name":"Title","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"12","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":55,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/55","name":"Percent Completed","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"012100","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":56,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/56","name":"Weight","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}

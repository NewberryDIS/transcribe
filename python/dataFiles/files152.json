I am going to sow about 11 acres of millet, which will leave about 49 for corn. The spring seems to be quite backward so far. There has been little planting done yet that I hear of. I have sold two heifers and calves lately. I do not know whether I have mentioned it. They were the two poorest among the three-yr. olds. I got $50 for the two - (22 and 28). I sold the six fat hogs a week last Monday at 6.00 a hundred. They averaged 423. I want to sell the nine last spring steer calves. Those are all I am offering for sale now.

Apr 4 1892.\nDear Eddie, This is the only bit of paper I can find. I will get more when I go to town. Your card (Chicago) and your letter from Ypsilanti came to hand together Saturday. We were very glad to hear from you. Mr. Stott the jeweler fitted or inserted the sheeted glass. But it was a little too large, and the screw consequently too short. So it came loose the next morning on rubbing the glasses. I got Libby to tie it on tightly with thread, and it does very well so thus far. I find it is a great improvement on the old glass, and am very glad to have it. It is a continued wonder that I can see so much better with it. - Tell your Aunt Mary that I forgot to send that Postal Card to the Bible Society. I fully intended to do it but it slipped my mind till too late. I am very sorry. We had a very heavy wind Friday and it is blowing hard to day. Yesterday it rained. Saturday was the first day this spring that Robert could plow. It was only barely dry enough. Today it is too wet. The Inter Ocean came by Saturday's mail.

This has been a very hot month. It has been cooler since the rain, but to day it is hot again but with a good South wind. I got your last letter Wednesday. I am very glad to hear so often. I find I have not yet learned to keep my letters so I can get hold of them, when I want to write back. I got a letter from cousin Mary Ann Saturday.

Griffiths with reference to the school. He says that the Trustees wish you to come to teach the school - but he says they are willing to give is $1.50 and board around, or $2 - without board. Two of the trustees (Mr. James Powell & Elias R. Jones) personally & directly have no interest in the school (though perhaps as Elias has lately married, he may think he soon will have an interest there), and I suppose, they think they are pretty generous in being willing to do as much as that. Father & mother are very anxious that you should come and teach the school. Mother is afraid if you do not that we shall have no school, or one that will be worse than none as we had last summer. Father says that he will board you for the company that you will give Sarah, etc. etc. I had thought that they would be willing to give $2.25, and they ought to give it.

Ain't I a considerate housewife. & beside I had particularly urged the expediency and wisdom of the ready pay system in future and I was not willing that any imprudent expenditure on my part should cause a departure from it.\n Maybe I shall come next anniversary: but it's quite doubtful.\n Sarah is not gaining much.

Dear Sister Mary\nI was very glad to get your good affectionate letter. I do not undertake now to write you a letter for I have no time. But this is on a matter of business. I vomited after dinner one day last week, and since then I have been troubled with unpleasant symptoms of a return of the same. I think it arises from malaria and perhaps overeating.

I hope your visit is doing you good, and that you are enjoying yourself.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":35507,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/35507","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/6b0fa097239c4cac773eb65f3b431315.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/6b0fa097239c4cac773eb65f3b431315.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/6b0fa097239c4cac773eb65f3b431315.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6b0fa097239c4cac773eb65f3b431315.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T19:15:46+00:00","modified":"2020-04-15T15:06:12+00:00","filename":"6b0fa097239c4cac773eb65f3b431315.jpg","authentication":"995fe7dcb0b5a8260f798dfa0d9ae3d7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_02_fl_115_018_01_o2.jpg","size":1253744,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2886,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040224326890994},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["043459"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["043459"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["043459"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6b0fa097239c4cac773eb65f3b431315.jpg","FileDateTime":1507749077,"FileSize":1253744,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2886\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2886,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:03:03 15:33:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:02 04:34:59","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:02 04:34:59","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":30,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2339,"ExifImageLength":2917,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":152,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/152","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Osawatomie, Jan. 12, 1884. Dear Sister Mary\nI am your debtor for 2 letters since I have written to you - One mailed Jan 4, and the other the 7th. The last of last week I seemed to be remarkably well - indeed I felt perfectly well only for weakness. But I suppose I undertook to do too much & this week I have felt tired a good deal of the time day times feeling better towards night and till after breakfast in the morning. I have some palpitation after eating especially but sitting down and doing nothing seemed to stop it - so I laid it to weakness, and have taken nothing so far. My appetite is pretty good for some kinds of food - I am inclined to eat too much particularly as I feel the need of something to build me up. I do not know whether I can get the Extracts of Malt or Coca here, but I will send down to day to see. I am not discouraged - think I will get along - but I seem to gain very slowly. The weather has been very cold here - but now it is quite pleasant - beautiful sunshine and mild South wind. It is cold enough nights to keep the ground covered with snow, and so far to prevent much thawing.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":35508,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/35508","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/3bed4913cc9afb175908e3faa37d9c0d.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/3bed4913cc9afb175908e3faa37d9c0d.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/3bed4913cc9afb175908e3faa37d9c0d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3bed4913cc9afb175908e3faa37d9c0d.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T19:15:49+00:00","modified":"2020-04-15T15:12:19+00:00","filename":"3bed4913cc9afb175908e3faa37d9c0d.jpg","authentication":"0caedec8478d67b4c331dc908dfbe9ce","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_02_fl_115_018_02_o2.jpg","size":1141437,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2889,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.036583112187993},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["043502"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["043502"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["043502"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3bed4913cc9afb175908e3faa37d9c0d.jpg","FileDateTime":1507749077,"FileSize":1141437,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2889\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2889,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:03:03 15:33:10","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:02 04:35:02","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:02 04:35:02","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":30,"SubSecTimeOriginal":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2332,"ExifImageLength":2905,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":152,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/152","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"You do not write about your own health, are you pretty well?

The Beatty Fluid Extract of Coca they did not have in Oswawatomie but had Park, Davis & Co.

I did not see the man I sent by. It looks on turning out in a teaspoon a little turbid, dark and purplish, and tastes aromatic. I took two doses, less than a teaspoonful, also Lactopeptine after meals. and as I thought from your description that Phosphorus was the proper thing, I took twice of that. At bedtime I had a passage of the bowels and small passages twice in the night. I shall not take ny of this Coca today. What is the effects designed from it?

Sir W.  Thomson is I believe an eminent name among living English scientists. I have seen a remark attributed to him in respect to the possibility or probability of collision among the fixed stars. You know the fixed stars are all thought to be in motion - many miles a second - but their distance from us so inconceivably vast that it will take ages to make their relative positions differ. They seem to move according to no known law in every direction like meteors or comets. Sir W. Thomson likens them to ships sailing on the Atlantic Ocean, at random, if time enough is given, some two would be sure to collide. I had just been reading that when I came across this passage \"By the word of the Lord the Heavens were created, and all the Host of them by the breath of his mouth.\" I can not believe there is no Pilot in all these vast and amazing movements in the Heavenly bodies.

Yours of Apr. 6 was received Saturday. I have not much to write. Nothing unusual has occurred to us. We have had two very heavy wind storms every since Eddy left, but they did us no harm. In town a few rods of plank side walk were blown about, but little harm done. We have had a good deal of rainy weather, so that we have not done much plowing yet. It rained last night. Robert planted early potatoes the last of last week. Since then we have had two rains. My health does not very much. I feel well, but do not get strong. I have taken the sulphur once or twice a day.

I was interested in all you wrote and will prize the things you sent more for knowing what you have written. I have time to write but little now. I am waiting for Eddie (7 a.m.) to go up to the farm. I go up every day. I feel a great deal better to work some. My health is improving much faster since I have been able to exercise more. Walking for exercise is less satisfactory than when I could see better. But improvement now is marked. especially noticable [sic] in improved digestion. I suppose the same rule will not work for everyone - even every one that is seventy five years old. If you have not already done it do not say any thing to cousin Mary about the overcoat.

Brother Robert,\nWhen you came home, I was very anxious to get a letter from you if it was only to see your hand writing. I suppose you feel anxious to hear from home, as we both did before I started from Grafenberg [?]. And although I have nothing particular to say of myself, and do not feel any special attack of the writing distemper, still I take my pen in hand on the principle of doing as I would be done by. I called on Uncle Hughes [?] family and Aunt Sarah in passing through York Mills. They were all well. The handkerchief that come around your pants belongs to Cousin William. It was sent by mistake. Sent it back the first opportunity. Elizabeth and June and Mr Butter were in usual health. They were much surprised to see me. They thought I looked better, but thinner. There was quite a fire in Whitesboro Wednesday morning about 11 o'[clock. Clapp's Tavern was burnt down.

We are now asking recipients for it for next year, or for six months only, until July , to end the first Volume, if that is more optional. Its Conditions are 50 cents for the year \u2014 25 cents for six 'months, - the charges to be sent to us in good standing with the orders. We can't give it out at such a low price, but provided the payments are received, without exception, IN ADVANCE.\n As much as the selections are made indiscriminately, from the many excellent Magazines published by the various denominations in Wales, we plead with confidence in the co-operation of the various Denominations in the spread of the Doctrine. The Supervisors who worked so well at its inception are wished to continue in their love for him for 1851, and it is hoped that many new Supervisors will also be won.

May 21 1855.\nDear Father and Mother and Mary\nWe got the May Cenhadwr the 11th of this month. The Cenhadwr was never so welcome before. We had not a word from home by mail since we had been in the territory. A Mr Knox from Rex? Corners, Oneida Co had brought us a letter from Jane. When we got the Cen. we had seen almost no newspapers since we had been in the territory. No Tribune later than March 27. So the news we got in the Cen. was very acceptable. We had a chance to send to Lawrence next day to have our letters forwarded from there. Have not yet got them. Got your letter, dated April 30, last Thursday evening. Were very glad to hear from you. I presume you will have seen the letter we wrote to Robert by Mr Knox. I have not much news to send. Emigrants continue to crowd into the country. The man who assumes the chief management in this settlement, Mr Brown, is not at all truthful. So most of those who come here now go away again. In fact the wood about here is all taken about, or covered by claims in some way. There are many false claims however, when one man tries to hold more than his share. Those who get on to such claims, although their legal right is perfect, generally have some trouble with them. We are having a little trouble with ours. The Justice of the Peace here assures us that our right under the preemption law is indisputable, and that we shall be protected in our rights. Still we may be defrauded. I few are, the unclear is unclear to choose again. The weather here is very different from yours. For example, April 30, the thermometer rose to 97 in the shade. But then was unclear breeze that I was perfectly astonished to see where it stood. It has been excessively dry, however, so that vegetation is not as forward as one would expect from the dry weather we have had. We have had a few showers within the last fortnight. Previously we had no rain. The prospect has seemed rather discouraging on account of this drouth, but it looks better now. I am proposing all the time to write you long letters home & to Elizabeth and Robert & Jane.

These crossings are generally dry but yesterday the water was over a horse's head. We must expect interrupted mails occasionally, especially in the spring.

Am very sorry to need such assistance, for I know how many calls you have on your resources. Have now about $13.75 besides that most of which I owe to rent &c. I wish you could borrow for yourself what you have sent us, and hold me responsible for the payment. Am very sorry to hear of Robert's illness. Hope to hear by your next that he is better. Would be very glad to see him out here, if travelling would be beneficial to him. But it is a long way, and I cannot have much hopes of seeing him or any of you very soon. Sarah's health continues miserably poor. I hope she will be better when the weather gets warmer. She is better of her chills, but she does not get up from them, and continues very feeble and nervous.

Were very glad to hear that Robert was getting better. Hope he will continue to improve and get his health better. Hope he will continue to improve and get his health better than ever. I think it would be well worth while to try to save as many trees as you can in the way you suggest. It would be a great misfortune to lose that nice young orchard. The sap goes up into the tree from the roots in the outer wood (mainly). It passes into the leaves and is there prepared for supporting and feeding the tree as the blood that passes through the lungs for nourishing the animal body. It there returns between the bark and the wood depositing new wood, gradually losing its strength till it gets back to the root, receives a fresh supply, and prepares to go a new round. What you want to do then for your trees to save them is to provide for the safe passage of this upward and downward current of sap. This may be done by connecting the upper with the lower bark by a vigorous twig of last years growth. But I think it would be much more effectual if you should cover the surface that is eaten off with grafting composition. This would prevent it from drying and the sap might still go up through the old wood. The following is recommended as a good grafting composition: to 2 pounds of rosin ad 1 1\/4 lb of beeswax and 3\/4 lb of tallow. Russel Fuller had some trees girdled by mice and he succeeded in getting them to live through most of one summer by simply covering the exposed part with grafting composition. If the trees do not live in this way, I think I should saw them off\n\n[[transcriber's note: EHE in the annotation at top is probably Edward Holden Everett, one of the grandsons of John who wrote the letter, he was alive in 1966 and an avid genealogist.

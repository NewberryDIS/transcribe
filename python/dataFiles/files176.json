She is exceedingly good to me and would like to be very intimate with me but\nPlease give my respect to Mrs John and Miss Charlotte Marsh","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40980,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/40980","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c2ef174a294ba2193b9e70b2bbd10493.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/c2ef174a294ba2193b9e70b2bbd10493.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/c2ef174a294ba2193b9e70b2bbd10493.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c2ef174a294ba2193b9e70b2bbd10493.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T17:36:21+00:00","modified":"2020-05-19T02:30:30+00:00","filename":"c2ef174a294ba2193b9e70b2bbd10493.jpg","authentication":"da30230d0cac0f6994c6d32025dd49db","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_039_002_03_o2.jpg","size":1489018,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2824,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048821542860141},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024153"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024153"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024153"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c2ef174a294ba2193b9e70b2bbd10493.jpg","FileDateTime":1509384746,"FileSize":1489018,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2824\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2824,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:24 14:51:00","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:24 02:41:53","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:24 02:41:53","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":2,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3313,"ExifImageLength":4222,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":176,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/176","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I do not board with her and take no notice of her except to treat her civilly and politely. when I meet her neither shall I make her a friend untill she gives me as good reasons for changing my present opinions concerning her as she did for forming them.

I have not time to give you any advice as to your future course. I was in hopes that you would have wisdom so sufficient about you to come out here before I left that I might give you the wealth of my experience, but as you have done differently I do not see but that you must grope your way in dark as I have done. In reference to a Music Teacher, all that I can tell you is that Miss Franks will not do. The People will not send their Scholars to her. Miss Cicel might give the Lessons - but you then loose the tuition, & also would loose the Music Club from the School - I must confess that I don't admire your arrangement for Teachers. The Primary department I could cut loose from The School - it now amts to nothing since Helen left it , it has cost me more than $100 out of Pocket- in fact it has done nothing since Josephine Stedman had it - She broke it up - and I believe she will break up any school. However much you may think of her as a woman, don't be fooled as to think, that hence, she is a good Teacher. And again I hope she will treat you differently from what she has me - her bills for her school amounted to about $70 dolls. I took them and gave her sixty-six dolls for them - twenty-five dolls of them I shall never get a cent of  & for collecting most of the rest it has cost me 10 per cent. While she was teaching she was in school and for this I charged her only half price. When she left here I gave her $20, I know I overpaid her, but could not stop to go down to the house and get the Books, and see- it has run along till now  as she had not been","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":41003,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/41003","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/4041a96f83ba04ae3075dac4c7423f8b.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/4041a96f83ba04ae3075dac4c7423f8b.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/4041a96f83ba04ae3075dac4c7423f8b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4041a96f83ba04ae3075dac4c7423f8b.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T17:37:36+00:00","modified":"2020-05-19T03:18:51+00:00","filename":"4041a96f83ba04ae3075dac4c7423f8b.jpg","authentication":"60832760560cbd0c63f317f26b5b903e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_039_009_02_o2.jpg","size":1659509,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2849,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053934096434096},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024641"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024641"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024641"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4041a96f83ba04ae3075dac4c7423f8b.jpg","FileDateTime":1509384747,"FileSize":1659509,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2849\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2849,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:24 14:52:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:24 02:46:41","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:24 02:46:41","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":2,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3273,"ExifImageLength":4135,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":176,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/176","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"here since when I made my bills out I made out hers and there was\n$10 or between 9 and 10 due me from her -

Uncle Cheney \nhas moved down to the Pike place. Uncle John Nickerson \nhas bought the large place which Grandfather used to \nown & has moved down this spring, & Grandpa has gone \nto live with them. He talks of going to the Cape before \nlong, to stay a while. I went up there yesterday with \nCousin Jesse J Kendall from the Cape. He has been up \nabout six weeks & is going back in about a fortnight. \nEdwin is at work for Mr. Phiny? P. Gould. David continues \nto live with Mr. Smith. Jesse is going to live at Uncle Cutting's \nthis summer. Father has been at work for Mr. Lewis Brigham \nthis winter has taken a job in Petersham for the summer  \nHe does pretty much the same. I believe father's case come on \nin June after you went away. It was decided in his favor. \nMr. Powers carried it to the Supreme Court & it came on \nlast week. Father got the case again. Mr. Powers is to pay the cost \non both scores (which is not small) & to pay for the sixty seven \ndollars besides. I expect it is settled unless Mr. Powers carries \nit on farther. I have been expecting to teach school this \nsummer but have not any engaged yet don't know now \nwhether I shall or not. Mother has been to Wendall this \nspring. Edwin has been to Vermont.

How many times I have wished I could see you & have a long talk  with you but I suppose I must be deprived of the privelege of them for the present.

Dec. 18. 1842\nDearly Beloved brother. \nHaving not written to you for some time and thinking that I should like to chat with you a while and supposing that you would be glad to hear from us I sit down for a few minutes to pen a few lines to one whom I dearly love.  I received your letter Dec 5th gladly; also last night Mother received one from Brother Erasmus which gave her much pleasure as we always love to hear fro you at any time.  Lydia & I have been meeting to day but we are now seated at home very comfortable if I may call it so . But it don't seem much like home to me for when I look about me it seems as if I had no home.  We are very well of it for provisions for us. Yesterday Edwin brought us a barrel of flour which we are to bread for. Last week we had considerable hard wood brought to us from Uncle Francis expect some more I suppose Edwin will be responsible for it.  We have meat necessaries & clothing to make us comfortable we have a stove also but have not got our best furniture nor bedding but we have enough to get along very well with.  I do not feel worried at all but that we shall get along.  We have been to school at No 5 about 3 weeks.

June 18th 1843\n\n                                  43?\n\nMy beloved Brother\n\n                                                  I have just recieved your letter also one from Mary Powers both of which I perused with great interest. You directed it to Phillipston and Mother found it and sent it on to me. How glad I was to hear from you and to know that it was your own hand that penned those lines. O how I do want to see you. I reckon that I should chat a little for a while; but suppose I must be denied the favor. I suppose that you would like a description of my business this summer. Well I will try and give  it. I came to Montague May 10th ( in the stage and had a pleasant ride) and went to cousin Eliza Webster's and staid untill Monday morning some past 6 o'clock when Mr. Payne the agent of the district came to carry me to have the sentence passed upon me. I felt somewhat timid as you can readily imagine being amongst strangers and having to appear before 2 clergymen and another gentleman. However I made out much better than I expected and we made our way to the schoolhouse and I guess my heart beat as much as once or twice as I entered it; but I got along first rate and have what I call a pretty large school. I have 29 different ones besides two or three more that I expect will come some.

Dear brother Father is almost gone. I do not much expect that he will live for you to get home but he may. He has altered very much since you left him.

Dec. 28th 1845\nSunday evening   \nDear brother Nathan\n\n                                                 It is sometime since I recieved and perused your letter and think that you have exclaimed more than once \"why don't I have a letter from Sister Sarah\" but you must forgive me for delaying to write, for you know that I am always very busy, besides I am not sorry that I have neglected so doing, for I have recieved a letter from brother Edwin and Sister Lydia and now you will stand a chance to hear from them, as I shall write you about them. You can imagine something from experience how glad I was to get and examine your letter, for what gives one greater pleasure, when separated from friends and deprived of the privelege of seeing them, than to hear from them, to recognize their own writing, and peruse their own thoughts?

afairs in this part of the country. My school closed the 28th of July had a very pleasant school and enjoyed myself much better than I expected. Mr. Young sends his best respects to you and said that he should depend upon you to teach this winter, they are haveing a new house built and think that it will be done so that you can commence at the same time that you did last year. The people all send their best respects and would be happy to hear from you. There is going to be a school at Petersham it will be kept by Andrew Wheeler. The girls are most of them going to attend. Grandfather has been very sick but is better now. Myron has the Chicken pox and mother thinks that he has the measles with them but don't know.

You will laugh I imagine as much of not more when I inform you of how and when I arrived here as we did one evening at the table when talking of my conveyance and introduction here; sometimes I burst out laughing myself when I think of my adventures from the time I left home until I reached Lebanon.  You recollect I suppose of seeing me safely deposited in the stage on the 27th with the intention of reaching my destined place that night, but it was \"no go\"; when I reached Bellow Falls who should I meet there but Raymond, coming after me; as I did not come and had not written him he did not know what to make of it; was afraid I was sick and was on his way to a ascertain the facts in regard to the matter. Well as a natural consequence, of course, he must go and see Abby and I must go with him as we were so near and delay going to Lebanon until the next day (Friday). Accordingly we went to Rockingham and took dinner and in the afternoon we all went down to Papermill Village and found the folks very glad to see us. Mr. Emerson was there and probably knew we were as we were around making a number of calls, but did not show himself. Miss Gay had just left - R.M.G. she had been spending a week at his father's, he (Emerson) has gone to Wilmington, Deleware. But to proceed with the description of my journey; Friday morning we started from R_ and reached here at night - somewhat tired.

Monday we also made a call and received one, Tuesday we corrected twenty compositions, Wednesday we attended a lecture and to night - have told you what I am going to do. There are three churches here and regular preaching at each. The Universalist is very prettily furnished (I attend this) there is a good & large society and the preaching excellent. I wish you could listen to it with me sometimes, it is so elevating and soul-stirring. The Academy is in the hands of this society. Rev. Mr. Mason (our minister) is associate Principal in the school and a smart and good man he is; he has no recitation however, is acquainted with all the modern languages and will teach them if any wish. Like Mr. Marshall as a Preacher? very much, takes much interest in the school and is well fitted for the station which he occupies. The Universalist society made a Pic-nic about three weeks since and the students and teachers of the Academy were invited to join it and a fine time, delightful place and nice refreshments we had.

Raymond has been to see me twice, has charge of the preparatory Department in N. U. this fall; says he's not heard from you for a long time.

Had a letter this morning from one of my dear friends  at Pembroke, writes very affectionately; the school is prospering finely there considering all things, have about one hundred scholars. Had one also from Miss Gray (you recollect her) lives in South Orange, her health is still very poor.

It is a delightful day and Nature seems to be in her gayest mood; everything is replete with life and happiness. It forcibly reminds me of the Sabbath - just three year ago at this time on which you dear brother and myself strolled to the west part of the city of Albany. What a delightful prospect presented itself to our view  - how animated we were by the scene! Methinks I am even now by your side watching the beautiful stream coursing its way through the deep ravine below us or sitting with you upon the fresh, green grass under a wide spreading tree looking with delight upon the city and distant hills. Neither can you have forgotten the Sabbath upon which we crossed the Hudson and spent hours walking upon its banks, or the morn upon which I left Albany for my childhood's home.  It seems to me that I never saw Nature so lovely, or her scenery so beautiful as it was from there to Troy.  Recollect you how a noble steamer swept the waters of the Hudson at our right as it to outrun us?

I must tell you how we spent the first day of May. In the morning we were occupied in school, in the afternoon we had a walk and the evening the young ladies and gentlemen spent with me at my boarding place The refreshments consisted of various kinds of nuts, raisins and apples.

I feel that a great responsibility is resting upon me and that I am young to occupy such a station, but I try to do well and conduct myself so that my influence shall be good and trust I succeed in some degree. I understand that Miss Woodbury is coming here to school this summer; shall be glad to see her.

I love to write home, and love to receive\nletters from there and hope you and Sister will write us as\noften as possible. Am expecting to hear from her and Lucy Miller\nsoon. Nathan is also expecting a letter from Edwin every day. We hear\nfrom Erasmus and Raymond too; they both write as though they\nwere in good spirits. In regards to what you wrote about the\nproposals Raymond made you I want you to do what you think\nwill make you happiest and be the best for you. I know Sister\nAbby is good and sincere in what she written to you upon the\nsubject and that she would do all she could to make you happy\nbut I do not think Raymond is able now to take upon himself\n(I do not know to be sure how he stands in the world in regard to his pecuniary\nmatters) what he proposes to you and I know your feelings too well\nto think you would feel as independent there as you would to live\nby yourself and the difference existing between your religious views\nand theirs and being so far from scenes and place of your past-\nlife might be sources of unhappiness to you, but you must weigh\nthe subject deeply and act as you think best. I think it would be\nbest for Jesse perhaps to go and live with Brother R - for then he\nwould have some one to watch over him and protect him and I\nknow he and Abby would be kind to him and do all they could\nfor him; as for Myron Nathan and myself will look after him.\nI do not intend staying this way any longer than duty seems to","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":41105,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/41105","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/fcde119f9a38d8cc8e7999644e364469.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/fcde119f9a38d8cc8e7999644e364469.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/fcde119f9a38d8cc8e7999644e364469.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fcde119f9a38d8cc8e7999644e364469.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T17:42:59+00:00","modified":"2020-04-09T23:53:48+00:00","filename":"fcde119f9a38d8cc8e7999644e364469.jpg","authentication":"0f5dfcba9bfc10b8121eff39741ecfb5","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_041_014_02_o2.jpg","size":1460915,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2885,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046887316259067},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["235903"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["235903"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["235903"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"fcde119f9a38d8cc8e7999644e364469.jpg","FileDateTime":1509384751,"FileSize":1460915,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2885\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2885,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:26 15:15:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:24 23:59:03","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:24 23:59:03","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":8,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3457,"ExifImageLength":4313,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":176,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/176","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Sarah\nrequire, for living here is not congenial with my feelings and never has been and I cannot think of doing it any great length of time. If I live, shall return to New England in two years at most from this time with the intention of staying there and think if you conclude to remain there you had better stay where you are if Mr. Miller will rent the house to you until one or both of us return and keep Myron with you and watch over him and bring him up the best you can. Will send you soon money to pay his tuition this fall and to get him books for the Winter if he needs any. Wish him to pay close attention to ciphering, writing and spelling and be a good boy in all things - tell him so from me. If at any time you should need any money don't be afraid to let me know it -for if I am well I shall have it to spare you. Intend on my return establishing a school somewhere myself and should like Sister's cooperation unless she wishes to go and stay with Raymond or should be married in the meantime. After receiving a letter from her shall write her all about these things. Hope to write to David and Jesse soon; suppose they hear from us through you and you must always write us about them. Should think cousin Sarah would write me a she did not know where she should be this fall when I left. Hope I shall get time to write to Roeana, Mrs. Stone and other relatives and friends before long. You must remember me to all friends in Phillipston. Give my love to Mr. Miller & family - how much I should like to see them all. How much I would give to enjoy the privilege of visiting the burying ground in P__ to night and coming to see you and finding sister there. The Miniatures we took with us are a great satisfaction to us but I will write no more this time. Affectionately Sarah [later Weaver]\n[left-hand side] Monday night= Oc 16th Have received a letter today from Cousin Sarah and it was such a cousinly one that it has done me much good.

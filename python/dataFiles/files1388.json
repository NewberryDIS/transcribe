I wanted to keep my mind active, and divert it\n\nfrom my troubles and all the sordid dullness around me, but the effort at concentration was too great, and the beating I was taking took the heart out of me - But I'd still\nlike to finish it when I get out, if only because I think I have something to say about musicians and entertainers and homosexuals that hasn't been said. Then too, of course,\nI enjoy doing it. It's called A Tinkling Piano, about a two-piano team, based on characters I've known, like Jimmy Page and Gwen Paul, among others. Gwen was certainly\nan unforgettable, robust, ribald, beautiful soul with a flair for jazz, and a perception that many musicians cannot equal.\n\n I have another project left unfinished in Chicago that I'd like to get back to. I was working with a young composer, a brilliant guy on a play called Season in Hell, built around the scandalous and tragi-comic affair between the two poets Verlaine and Rimbaud. Some of the music, tone-poems on Rimbaud's Illuminations, was already written,\n\nwhen we had a temperamental tohu-bohu and quit. But I still think it's a fantastic and moving little story, and that there's a play in it, as the agents say.\n\n I would certainly appreciate a copy of Midland Humor, if you want to trouble to send it, Jack. I remember skipping through it once and liking what I saw.

\"[Zaunchi?] the Chicken\" by Eli Waldrow, and Richard Wright's \"Early Days in Chicago.\" Many of the stories, I noticed,\" are written in the truncated, headless-and-legless style made popular,

I fear I shall find that tracks a triple fast after the sheltered life of the chain gang.\nThe last batch of English magazines was a delight, particularly the Books Number of the Listener, and the London Opinions. I find it hard to put my fingers on the exact quality of the literary reviews in the Listener that makes them so different from their American counterparts - Perhaps it is their aura of graciousness, of good faith, good will.\nAt any rate, I enjoyed the urbane and gently devastating job that [Hesheth?] Pearson did on St. John Ervine for Ervine's book on Oscar Wilde. He also demolishes Andre Gide and his book on the same subject, but demolishing Gide seems to be a popular sport at present. Poor Andre has fallen on evil days, and surely doesn't deserve it.\n(over)","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":119001,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/119001","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/fcda29810e4e7693662ba2880e770112.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/fcda29810e4e7693662ba2880e770112.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/fcda29810e4e7693662ba2880e770112.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fcda29810e4e7693662ba2880e770112.jpg"},"added":"2021-06-14T20:27:16+00:00","modified":"2021-06-29T16:47:12+00:00","filename":"fcda29810e4e7693662ba2880e770112.jpg","authentication":"993a7a738ceef4ca3ab9016ff6d171f7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_conroy_box_003_fl_129_020_002_o2.jpg","size":1619828,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2833,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05294178400073211443466192349660559557378292083740234375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20210323"],"TimeCreated":["213746-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["992006198805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Conroy Box 3"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20210323"],"TimeCreated":["213746-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["992006198805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Conroy Box 3"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20210323"],"TimeCreated":["213746-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["992006198805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Conroy Box 3"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1388,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1388","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"-2-\nThe review by William Plomer of certain English publications of American humor, shed some light on the English sense of humor, and I was somewhat reassured to find that they laugh at many of the same things we do.

The bales of hay were five feet long and two feet high, weighing about fifty pounds, and had to be lifted from the field where they were dropped by the baler and swung onto a slowly moving wagon.

I cannot believe you could be indifferent to my pitiful plight.

And the outraged Dickens.\nI am still chewing out my own vitals in the process of excreting a masterpiece - to make the metaphor woolier, I feel like a slug on a vast, endless cabbage leaf - Gnaw, gnaw, gnaw, with no discernible progress.\nUntil recently, I was trying to work in a tank with about fourteen other guys, and concentration was the least, to say the most. I took my problem to the Captain, and he gave me a cell by myself. So now I'm locked in with the Thing, and there is nothing to do but work. I remember reading recently that somebody offered James Jones eight-million dollars, or some such sum, to appear on television and he said he was too busy working on his second book, that he was \"living with his characters.\" Man, he's nowhere, I'm locked up with mine.\nHow did you like the Warren book? I note that Eleanor, the word-mincer, found it 'repetitious.' It was a trifle solemn, perhaps, but there appears to be some sort of ferment there.\nRemember to lower the flag Thursday the 18, and beat the drum slowly. Got any Limey magazines?

Their simplicity and directness are a bracing breeze after my daily contacts with the familiar transparent chicanery and spiritual bankruptcy of my Caucasian compatriots.

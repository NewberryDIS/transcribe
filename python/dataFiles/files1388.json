I wanted to keep my mind active, and divert it\n\nfrom my troubles and all the sordid dullness around me, but the effort at concentration was too great, and the beating I was taking took the heart out of me - But I'd still\nlike to finish it when I get out, if only because I think I have something to say about musicians and entertainers and homosexuals that hasn't been said. Then too, of course,\nI enjoy doing it. It's called A Tinkling Piano, about a two-piano team, based on characters I've known, like Jimmy Page and Gwen Paul, among others. Gwen was certainly\nan unforgettable, robust, ribald, beautiful soul with a flair for jazz, and a perception that many musicians cannot equal.\n\n I have another project left unfinished in Chicago that I'd like to get back to. I was working with a young composer, a brilliant guy on a play called Season in Hell, built around the scandalous and tragi-comic affair between the two poets Verlaine and Rimbaud. Some of the music, tone-poems on Rimbaud's Illuminations, was already written,\n\nwhen we had a temperamental tohu-bohu and quit. But I still think it's a fantastic and moving little story, and that there's a play in it, as the agents say.\n\n I would certainly appreciate a copy of Midland Humor, if you want to trouble to send it, Jack. I remember skipping through it once and liking what I saw.

I fear I shall find that tracks a triple fast after the sheltered life of the chain gang.\nThe last batch of English magazines was a delight, particularly the Books Number of the Listener, and the London Opinions. I find it hard to put my fingers on the exact quality of the literary reviews in the Listener that makes them so different from their American counterparts - Perhaps it is their aura of graciousness, of good faith, good will.\nAt any rate, I enjoyed the urbane and gently devastating job that [Hesheth?] Pearson did on St. John Ervine for Ervine's book on Oscar Wilde. He also demolishes Andre Gide and his book on the same subject, but demolishing Gide seems to be a popular sport at present. Poor Andre has fallen on evil days, and surely doesn't deserve it.\n(over)","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":119001,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/119001","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/fcda29810e4e7693662ba2880e770112.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/fcda29810e4e7693662ba2880e770112.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/fcda29810e4e7693662ba2880e770112.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fcda29810e4e7693662ba2880e770112.jpg"},"added":"2021-06-14T20:27:16+00:00","modified":"2021-06-29T16:47:12+00:00","filename":"fcda29810e4e7693662ba2880e770112.jpg","authentication":"993a7a738ceef4ca3ab9016ff6d171f7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_conroy_box_003_fl_129_020_002_o2.jpg","size":1619828,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2833,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05294178400073211443466192349660559557378292083740234375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20210323"],"TimeCreated":["213746-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["992006198805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Conroy Box 3"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20210323"],"TimeCreated":["213746-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["992006198805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Conroy Box 3"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20210323"],"TimeCreated":["213746-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["992006198805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Conroy Box 3"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1388,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1388","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"-2-\nThe review by William Plomer of certain English publications of American humor, shed some light on the English sense of humor, and I was somewhat reassured to find that they laugh at many of the same things we do.

I cannot believe you could be indifferent to my pitiful plight.

And the outraged Dickens.\nI am still chewing out my own vitals in the process of excreting a masterpiece - to make the metaphor woolier, I feel like a slug on a vast, endless cabbage leaf - Gnaw, gnaw, gnaw, with no discernible progress.\nUntil recently, I was trying to work in a tank with about fourteen other guys, and concentration was the least, to say the most. I took my problem to the Captain, and he gave me a cell by myself. So now I'm locked in with the Thing, and there is nothing to do but work. I remember reading recently that somebody offered James Jones eight-million dollars, or some such sum, to appear on television and he said he was too busy working on his second book, that he was \"living with his characters.\" Man, he's nowhere, I'm locked up with mine.\nHow did you like the Warren book? I note that Eleanor, the word-mincer, found it 'repetitious.' It was a trifle solemn, perhaps, but there appears to be some sort of ferment there.\nRemember to lower the flag Thursday the 18, and beat the drum slowly. Got any Limey magazines?

O Tempora! O Mores!\nDear Lorraine,\n\n   The note of wistful nostalgia in your last letter touched and distressed me.  For some reason, (and it has always been thus) my own mild and chronic unease bothers me less than the thought that you should be unhappy.  You've always been, at least to me, a person of vast reserve and taciturnity, and if you ever chose to show any degree of emotion, it always seemed to me a studied parody of what you were really feeling - only when you were gay did the mood seem to ring true, it would have been impossible to simulate the bubbling delight you felt.  Perhaps it seemed so rich because it was so rare.  So much of  you has always  been in a minor key.  So much careful darkness that the flashes of light were revelations - ah well,  as always when I try to say what I deeply feel, I flounder.  Besides, I was never permitted truly to know you, and the accrued curiosity has become mountainous.

It was a great pleasure meeting you and your wife, and if you are ever in London again, do drop in for the \"olde Englishe\" custom of tea-drinking.\n   Hoping to hear from you again, kindest  regards to you and your wife, from all of us (Mum, Dad, Lynne & Nelson).\n\nYours sincerely,\n?Gary Blessingfield?","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":119095,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/119095","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d20041bcbde48f2d1aa1831f7731c1ac.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d20041bcbde48f2d1aa1831f7731c1ac.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d20041bcbde48f2d1aa1831f7731c1ac.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d20041bcbde48f2d1aa1831f7731c1ac.jpg"},"added":"2021-06-14T20:28:56+00:00","modified":"2022-01-11T05:32:46+00:00","filename":"d20041bcbde48f2d1aa1831f7731c1ac.jpg","authentication":"a668d505538ceb00c2fb117667149eae","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_conroy_box_003_fl_139_001_001_o2.jpg","size":1894736,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2795,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0627687007221890969077549016219563782215118408203125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20210406"],"TimeCreated":["015414-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["992006198805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Conroy Box 3"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20210406"],"TimeCreated":["015414-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["992006198805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Conroy Box 3"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20210406"],"TimeCreated":["015414-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["992006198805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Conroy Box 3"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1388,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1388","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"printed sheet with space for censor's stamp and spaces for \"To\" and \"From\"\nHi Pal,\n\n   How are things around town and how have  you been.  Guess you are still making the most of a weak heart, but you seemed to be right on the old beam the last time I saw you.  Things have been pretty much the same since I saw you last, the army life does not change much.  Was in New York city the other night.  I went in with a couple friends and we hit a few of the spots around Brdw. & 42nd ST, however I had a better time when I was there before, guess it is the uniform that makes the difference.  I have been moved since I saw you last, you probably gathered as much from the way my return address has been changed.   Have you heard from any of the lads up Chicago way.  I meant to get Conroy's address from you while I was home but I forgot, so in the meantime send it to me the next time you write.   There is really no news that I can write you other than that in the papers and I dont get many papers except the New York sheets and they leave much to be desired in the way of information.  Have you been up on the Ill. river yet?  But O then I suppose that the water is too high to be very good for fishing, isnt it?  Catch a few for me and in the meantime take care of yourself.\n\nYour Pal\nSteve\nimprint at bottom of page    V...-MAIL    POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT PERMIT NO. 1","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":119096,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/119096","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/18ed7360d43cce8b3d67892347e419ab.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/18ed7360d43cce8b3d67892347e419ab.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/18ed7360d43cce8b3d67892347e419ab.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/18ed7360d43cce8b3d67892347e419ab.jpg"},"added":"2021-06-14T20:28:58+00:00","modified":"2022-01-12T04:27:29+00:00","filename":"18ed7360d43cce8b3d67892347e419ab.jpg","authentication":"e50ca381635f8e6cee0c26f53d30bb92","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_conroy_box_003_fl_139_002_001_o2.jpg","size":1309638,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2492,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048660825753522381209581482153225806541740894317626953125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20210323"],"TimeCreated":["220437-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["992006198805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Conroy Box 3"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20210323"],"TimeCreated":["220437-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["992006198805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Conroy Box 3"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20210323"],"TimeCreated":["220437-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["992006198805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Conroy Box 3"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1388,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1388","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Dec. 23 - 49\nDear Jackson:\n\n  Please forgive me for being so careless about my address, I must have been in Cairo Ill. about the time you were down here, after all you know I would not miss a Soiree at Wallys for anything.

indulgent advent.  Howdy, and wasn't it a splendid autumn.  almost enough to make me forget the burning summer.   Doug Wixson & Fred Whitehead kept me posted on the writers congress KC success.  They'd be a couple of good ones at a poker table I expect.  I thought you'd be interested in my Hiway 50 experience.

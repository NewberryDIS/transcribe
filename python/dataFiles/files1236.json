I left Bangor a week ago last Monday | August 25th | in company with Eliab & his wife & daughter Anna. E came to Boston on business & to take care of us his wife went on to visit her friends at East Hampton & Anna went on her way to Westfield where she was to stop a day or to then to Ellyria to visit Mrs Hopkins 2 or 3 weeks & then to Chicago where she will doubtless engage in teaching with encouraging prospects of success & trust. It seems rather sad to me for her at her age to go way to far from home seeking her fortune. I think it most likely her other enterprise that I wrote something about will be given all up as there are a good many difficulties in the way.\nLucy has been sorely afflicted with headache these 3 months past but is much relieved we all think she owes it to Homeophathy. I feasted my eyes almost to surputing, altho' we past it so rapidly, with with the beautiful, the romantic & the grand scenery between Boston & Northfield you have seen it and do not need a description & I could not give it if you did.\nHow retir'd and isolated Warwick is there is no Stage at all rune thro' the town now.

Jan. 21, 1854\nis a clever pious capable woman but from what I ha e heard said of her think she may be tho' kind hearted &c rather inclined to the Slam bang or Smash about & not so careful & economical as Aunt Conant  they have 5 children Smart forward & healthy now? I guess - Sam'l has been unfortunate had a great deal of sickness - when he first started in life he got married & bought a farm all in a hurry - without due consideration his Mother thought. He got in debt his Father gave him 2 or 3 hundred dollars to get him out he afterwards to better his condition swapt (sic) farms & got in debt again which his Father has seem'd to consider an unpardonable sin & he has firmly held back & determin'd he would not give or lend him & considering what he has done for unclear name S. has some reason to feel bad about it - it is also a burden of grief to his mother - I do not know, but I suspect that he is hard press'd & perhaps in some danger of losing his Farm Tis possible the feeling that he cannot expect much sympathy or help from his Father or Hervy has induc'd him to think of going away & I fear it will very much distress his Mother. I have made a long story of it, & it is mostly guesswork\nI doubt not that Charles will be very comfortable and happy with you - But he has had a sad time indeed, & a very hard time in consequence of the Sickness & Death of Mr. Gilman - besides the disappointment & frustrating his plans about work  But he can probably be useful to you & a benefit to himself in some capacity or other - I us'd to think he had the talent or ability in him for a good \"Boss\" but if he has it has lain dormant so long I dont know how he would manage  But I believe there is more of him than some folks think there is\nI have often thought that he & you too lack self confidence  not quite","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97924,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97924","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/5b2f08911e25d05e93faa17b7a96a31a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/5b2f08911e25d05e93faa17b7a96a31a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/5b2f08911e25d05e93faa17b7a96a31a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5b2f08911e25d05e93faa17b7a96a31a.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:38:18+00:00","modified":"2020-07-13T14:59:26+00:00","filename":"5b2f08911e25d05e93faa17b7a96a31a.jpg","authentication":"694557d806eb57cab8a94e06e35cefa9","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_83_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1616522,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2849,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.052537017537018},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["000239"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["000239"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["000239"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5b2f08911e25d05e93faa17b7a96a31a.jpg","FileDateTime":1587317838,"FileSize":1616522,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2849\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2849,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:33:24","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:11 00:02:39","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:11 00:02:39","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":37,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3441,"ExifImageLength":4348,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1236,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1236","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"ready enough to step forward and take the place that might belong to him -

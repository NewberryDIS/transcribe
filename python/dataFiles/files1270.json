There were 4 men working there laying up a pile of logs to make charcoal.\nIt was so far from the track & so high that it was cheaper they said to make their own coal Especially as the ground is covered there with fallen pine logs & some half burnt-\nI never was so tired since I can \"rember\" (sic) as I was when we got home - My head ached terribly & I ate for supper a cup of hot water & a piece of cheese - Then G.S. got the tub & some water & I took a bath and came out new and am not even stiff this morning.\nThe only way you can get a bath at this \"Mason House\" is to go to the kitchen & get a wash tub & take it to your room & carry your own water - Many of the men never take the trouble.\nAfter a few days of just washing in the wash room, hands & face alone, with the rest of the miners, I could stand it no longer & invested","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101229,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101229","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/987560ef3d8c196e53848f8886b00fdf.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/987560ef3d8c196e53848f8886b00fdf.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/987560ef3d8c196e53848f8886b00fdf.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/987560ef3d8c196e53848f8886b00fdf.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-20T19:29:19+00:00","modified":"2020-05-24T21:39:46+00:00","filename":"987560ef3d8c196e53848f8886b00fdf.jpg","authentication":"31b4f49956bb2cc85dd4913de455bdda","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_138_002_006_o2.jpg","size":1523901,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2829,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049876968697223002247032042077989899553358554840087890625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180723"],"TimeCreated":["221450"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180723"],"TimeCreated":["221450"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180723"],"TimeCreated":["221450"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"987560ef3d8c196e53848f8886b00fdf.jpg","FileDateTime":1587410949,"FileSize":1523901,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2829\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2829,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:24 13:51:47","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:23 22:14:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:23 22:14:50","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":7,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3278,"ExifImageLength":4171,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1270,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1270","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"in two small tin pails, a tin cup, and, a small pan costing altogether the small sum of 90\u00a2\u00a0!! & now we have washing tools in our own room -

The meeting was good but we don't seem to be getting hold of the unconverted. These people are hard to start. Terribly indifferent after \"gelt\". Listen respectfully but but do nothing - This morning Mr. Kettle & I helped raise the framework of the new church - It seems good to see it begin to unclear up - We shall probably go to Red Cliff some time this week & stay a week at least, there.

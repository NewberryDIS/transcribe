There were 4 men working there laying up a pile of logs to make charcoal.\n\nIt was so far from the track & so high that it was cheaper they said to make their own coal Especially as the ground is covered there with fallen pine logs & some half burnt-\n\nI never was so tired since I can \"rember\" (sic) as I was when we got home - My head ached terribly & I ate for supper a cup of hot water & a piece of cheese - Then G.S. got the tub & some water & I took a bath and came out new and am not even stiff this morning.\nThe only way you can get a bath at this \"Mason House\" is to go to the kitchen & get a wash tub & take it to your room & carry your own water - Many of the men never take the trouble.\nAfter a few days of just washing in the wash room, hands & face alone, with the rest of the miners, I could stand it no longer & invested","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101229,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101229","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/987560ef3d8c196e53848f8886b00fdf.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/987560ef3d8c196e53848f8886b00fdf.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/987560ef3d8c196e53848f8886b00fdf.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/987560ef3d8c196e53848f8886b00fdf.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-20T19:29:19+00:00","modified":"2021-12-30T16:17:51+00:00","filename":"987560ef3d8c196e53848f8886b00fdf.jpg","authentication":"31b4f49956bb2cc85dd4913de455bdda","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_138_002_006_o2.jpg","size":1523901,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2829,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049876968697223002247032042077989899553358554840087890625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180723"],"TimeCreated":["221450"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180723"],"TimeCreated":["221450"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180723"],"TimeCreated":["221450"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"987560ef3d8c196e53848f8886b00fdf.jpg","FileDateTime":1587410949,"FileSize":1523901,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2829\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2829,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:24 13:51:47","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:23 22:14:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:23 22:14:50","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":7,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3278,"ExifImageLength":4171,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1270,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1270","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"in two small tin pails, a tin cup, and, a small pan costing altogether the small sum of 90\u00a2\u00a0!! & now we have washing tools in our own room -

The meeting was good but we don't seem to be getting hold of the unconverted. These people are hard to start. Terribly indifferent after \"gelt\". Listen respectfully but do nothing - This morning Mr. Kettle & I helped raise the framework of the new church - It seems good to see it begin to loom up - We shall probably go to Red Cliff some time this week & stay a week at least, there.

Then the idea of disgraceing myself and family, when I could do nothing to recompence myself for it, immediately dispels the thought. So I will strugle on, and keep myself in as good cheer as possible, for in less than eight short months shall be clear from the Army, and by that time am in hopes that there will be no more need to peril ourselves for the sake of the dear old flag, which so many of our brave boys have fought and died to save from being trampled under foot.

Well I left the Camp of Distribution in N.O. on the 29th of Dec. had under my charge 16 men mostly Substitutes and drafted men with orders to turn them over to the Provost Marshal at this place. When I arrived here and turned the men over to the Provost Marshal, he gave me orders to take charge of eight of them and proceed to five mile creek and report them to their respective Regts. In a rough way he said he wanted me to execute the order if I had to go to Mobile to do it, the last order I barely escaped putting in to effect. Thus we started, nine of us without a gun, pistol or hardly a bowie knife, in a strange country, with no idea of the roads, or the direction that we were to take from all the information that we could gain from Soldiers at this place we were to keep to the right hand road, which road was not cut up by baggage trains, on account of there being so many mud holes but that the Infantry had traveled it for it was some nearer. We started out pretty brash for all were anxious to get to camp, the road ran nearly due East and nearly all the time in sight of the Sound We marched untill we thought we had gone a long six miles which distance they told us it was when we came in sight of a small town, and could see the camp fires, and horses picketed out to the trees for we were not over a fourth of a mile off. For some cause I was a little suspicious which made me a little cautious. I advanced cautiously untill I got behind a clump of bushes where I could have a fair sight of them, and sure enough there were no blue coats there nothing but Confed Cavalry. One thing is certain we beat a hasty retreat, and many a glance was cast behind to see if any one followed us. When we arrived back here again was told seven miles down the Sound there was a nest of Rebels quartered in a small town which had never been broken up We cooked a little Coffee and had a bit of fat Pork roasted on a Stick after which we again started for camp and arrived there first before dark That trip was a hard one for me and I did not get over the effects of it for a week, but now am getting like myself again gaining my strength fast.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":51910,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/51910","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b3dd53cf5f54b123efbc3f0688fc0363.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b3dd53cf5f54b123efbc3f0688fc0363.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b3dd53cf5f54b123efbc3f0688fc0363.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b3dd53cf5f54b123efbc3f0688fc0363.jpg"},"added":"2017-12-19T23:02:40+00:00","modified":"2020-01-23T21:33:02+00:00","filename":"b3dd53cf5f54b123efbc3f0688fc0363.jpg","authentication":"a0da991208dc26a2ddc0cb4110b3faa3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/civilwarletters\/archive\/fullsize\/ad0ac277a57973f64bf3fed0c5195c1b.jpg","size":165126,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":461,"resolution_y":800,"compression_ratio":0.14924620390456000418311077737598679959774017333984375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"Caption-Abstract":["Call Number: Vault Case MS 10014 Bx. 2  Fl. 117\rAuthor: Colby, Carlos W., 1837-1922.\rTitle: Carlos W.

That I was young and strong and could soon place her (my own expectation) upon a social equality with her brothers I pointed out to her what a sacrifice she would have to make. That I could not sacrafice an inate principal. I would die first. I then asked her if she was ready to make the sacrifice. She said she was. All this transpired (though not just in the words) before I considered our engagement binding and so the matter rested till a short time of the time when was to have been celibrated our nuptuals; when I received a letter (which I will not pretend to quote) expressing regret that she had ever entered into a contract which would compell her to sacrifice all she had in the world. And as though nothing had transpired on the subject warned me that if I married her I would get a peniless bride. I read the letter and these two thoughts fixed themselves in my mind. Eather she had loved me but now ceased to do so, or that she had never loved me - and was acting coquetting. I was inclined to give heed to the first thought but let which one would be true if she was coquetting with me a knoledge of that fact would drounded out any love I had borne her. I could not brook an insult so direct if she had ceased to love me and was tired of the engagement. Of course the part of a gentleman would compell me to set her free. I did it in a tender language as I know how to use. In answer to which she told me We meet henceforth as strangers the note admitted of no reply. So the thing stood. Annie has been away a long time. She got home last week. I meet her hast night I would have spoken to her but she passed me by in a manner which showed to me that if she had ever felt any love for me it is all gone. Henceforth we must be strangers not that it is my wish but because such treatment renders it necessary. I still have the most tender feeling for the little wayward girl but love her again think I never could.

I hope if you see that you are in the fault you will make atonement for the same. This is all I have to say at the present as I will have to write to Mother, Lee &amp; [M?]. I will close this then. Remember me to all friends write soon for I always am glad to hear from you. Direct to 2 Brig. 4th Divis. 13 Army Corps, New Orleans, La, to follow the Regt, and oblige you affect.

September 2d, 1864, My Beloved Sister, Having a few spare moments to myself, which I have not had before for the last 3 days I will attempt to answer your letter, also the note you enclosed in [Mollie?] Gelders letter. Day before yesterday we received orders to be ready to march at a moments warning. Consequently I was very buissey all day, trying to get away some sick, which took me all day. And at night I was very tired and sore from riding back and forward to Head Quarters. And on yesterday I had to post up my books and make out my monthly report. To day I feel some better that I have been for the last two days. On last eve. the orders we received the day before were countermanded and now we are ignirat when we will leave this place. We may go in a day or two or it may be weeks before we leave. Where we will next turn up I know not. Some think at Atlanta 'Yea.\" Others Memphis or there abouts. I fact: no one knows any thing about the movements, or destination, but should we leave and as soon as I have time I will let you know our where abouts. I reced your &amp; Mother letters last evening. Several of the boys reced letters stating the death of William Smiths \"father.\" Willie also received one.

The box is sent by the Ladies of the Altar Loyal League Society, hope soon to receive it for we need a few sanitary goods for the sick.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":51994,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/51994","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/fab4f64a0bea5d7e98fb48b81d82d5af.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/fab4f64a0bea5d7e98fb48b81d82d5af.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/fab4f64a0bea5d7e98fb48b81d82d5af.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fab4f64a0bea5d7e98fb48b81d82d5af.jpg"},"added":"2017-12-19T23:03:19+00:00","modified":"2020-01-23T21:33:01+00:00","filename":"fab4f64a0bea5d7e98fb48b81d82d5af.jpg","authentication":"230a0e37db2909229a3c829a8b4ce489","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/civilwarletters\/archive\/fullsize\/78c8fd3297f4e7b52d0a59a8db778135.jpg","size":176935,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":508,"resolution_y":800,"compression_ratio":0.1451238517060400023961364013302954845130443572998046875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"Caption-Abstract":["Call Number: Vault Case MS 10014 Bx. 2 Fl. 148\rAuthor: Colby, Carlos W., 1837-1922.\rTitle: Carlos W.

Since then we have experienced many hardships but we bear all with good grace knowing all is for the best and that our cause is Just.

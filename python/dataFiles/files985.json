The day it came I had been away all day helping Pa' and as I am not used to working all day I was some tired, when 'Mom' gave me your letter somehow most of the tiredness seem to leave me, as I was so awfully glad to get it, for I feel as if I had found a Friend in you. May I hope that I have? I know that I should like you very much. Please do not think me silly or one of these flappers for I am not. A girl can have bobbed hair and wear nickers (which I have and do) and still be a very modest and quiet girl, bashful too, which I am. You know as I told you before in one of my letters I have no one but my mother to tell things to and one always likes to have a Friend that they can talk (or write) and I think that you will appreciate.

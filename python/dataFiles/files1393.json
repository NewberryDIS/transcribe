She gave into my keeping a 36,000 word manuscript to be typewritten. she says it is a love story\n\ntold in the form of letters - a correspondence between two shut-ins - a man and a woman. None of her other stories have been accepted as yet but she has not \ngiven up hope and enjoys writing them just the same.\n\n In the afternoon, I went with Laura and Norine to the Majestic. Saw a good show. Mrs. Langtry was the star performer in a playette called \"Ashes\". She makes a\n\ngood appearance and seems to be a good actress, though the part she took did not call for any particular skill.   Glad the things reached you alright and hope the shoes have arrived by this time. The paper will come later.  Max did not have the time to get it ready last week. It will be sent","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":120039,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/120039","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/af5f4013f7aa3606e2b9d85a36d1a469.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/af5f4013f7aa3606e2b9d85a36d1a469.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/af5f4013f7aa3606e2b9d85a36d1a469.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/af5f4013f7aa3606e2b9d85a36d1a469.jpg"},"added":"2021-06-14T21:31:26+00:00","modified":"2021-07-29T20:27:41+00:00","filename":"af5f4013f7aa3606e2b9d85a36d1a469.jpg","authentication":"a4e816e6616e563a586e9e3267ef7acc","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_002_fl_065_020_002_o2.jpg","size":1348138,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2781,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0448858657290875928680407014326192438602447509765625},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20201209"],"TimeCreated":["022011-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 2"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20201209"],"TimeCreated":["022011-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 2"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20201209"],"TimeCreated":["022011-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 2"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1393,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1393","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"right from his office.

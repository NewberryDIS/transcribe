I sat down Monday Evening, Dec. 30th, and began to write to you; when Brother EIiab came in with a letter from Milo that Brother Joseph was suddenly worse. We came up to Milo as soon as possible on Tuesday but we found him dead. He died Tuesday morning.  He was taken Saturday morning 28th with a slight difficulty of breathing, and apparent effort to throw off something from the Lungs. But it was thought only the effect of a slight cold, and he was soon easier, and remained so Sunday and part of Monday. It appeared that the Paralysis suddenly attacked the Muscles about the Lungs, and rapidly progressed until it stopped his breath. But, as himself said, \"he believed he has everything prepared\"   He had constantly expected a fatal termination of his disease even when he seemed to others to be improving in health. When he was taken worse, he understood it, and he said at once that it would be useless to do anything for him. On Monday night when he was seised with the final distress for breath, he merely inquired of the Physician who was present \"How long will it take me?\" He expressed his readiness to go, and his thankfulness that he was not left, as","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102190,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102190","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c96dbe667616bc2bbbe788d9059f5308.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/c96dbe667616bc2bbbe788d9059f5308.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/c96dbe667616bc2bbbe788d9059f5308.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c96dbe667616bc2bbbe788d9059f5308.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:29:47+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:37+00:00","filename":"c96dbe667616bc2bbbe788d9059f5308.jpg","authentication":"44f7fa3d86b1970c27bfb691ab05e4b7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_174_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1510959,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2852,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04905456210067},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225558"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225558"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225558"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c96dbe667616bc2bbbe788d9059f5308.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806177,"FileSize":1510959,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2852\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2852,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:26:24","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 22:55:58","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 22:55:58","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3064,"ExifImageLength":3867,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"he had feared he should be, until the disease should reach his brain, and the mind be weakened.

Not the slightest complaint or murmur ever passed his lips, although he suffered acutely; in that respect his death was that of a stoic. In his last hours as ever before he appeared thoughtful only for others, almost unconscious of himself.  His mind was perfectly clear and unclouded to the very last; and his very death seemed but the last and most perfect triumph of a pure soul and a firm and lofty intellect over the wreck of matter, and the accidents of time.  Oh how beautiful was his corpse! It seemed, in its marble coldness, the perfect embodiment of purity and intellect. We could not weep for him: we ought rather to rejoice: Yet who that knew his worth. {Few could know half his worth}, could but weep at the untimely grave of so many hopes, of so much promise?

I have been for several weeks away from here, in fact, I could almost say, away from everywhere, making a tour through the Lumbering Region in the North and East part of this state. Your previous kind and excellent letters I received before I started and ought to have replied to at the time, but in thinking of other things I neglected or put it off at the time, and after I got into the woods there was no chance to write, though I believe I thought of it every day wherever I was. By the way I could tell you great accounts of my adventures and experiences of life in the Back woods. I went with my Brotherinlaw, Mr Furber, who is agent for large proprietors of Timber lands and is so obliged to look over the Lumbering operations occasionally, exploring the lands and surveying the lumber where it is out. I can hardly tell how long we were without sleeping in a bed or going into any house other than the Log crossed out \"camps\" of the Lumbermen. The sight of these camps would amuse you.

The fire inside may consist of some half a cord of wood, cut about eight feet long and burning in the middle of camp. On each side of this are laid down hemlock bought for a bed on which the men sleep in a row with their feet toward the fire. In some camps there are only six or eight men in some twenty or thirty, or even more.  We travelled from on camp to another, sometimes in the roads by which the Lumbermen carry in their supplies of provisions and hay, sometimes on the ice of the rivers and numerous lakes, and sometimes through the woods a foot on snow shoes, and guided by a pocket Compass or an occasional tree blased by some previous explorer.  I really enjoyed this life in the woods considerably with its great variety now communing with those rough and hardy lumbermen, and now with the great lakes, and mountains, and waterfalls; again watching the game and the winter birds in their native home, especially the Cropbills which even in the coldest weather make the sunny mornings vocal as spring around the camps; and then again assisting in counting or measuring the lumber, admiring perhaps 'fit mast for some admiral'; or perhaps for additional variety hunting or fishing a while. Grouse were abundant; we saw deer and lynxes, and moose the largest game and the largest animal of this climate, are to be found.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102195,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102195","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b96862899667595913cffd2ff28024fc.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b96862899667595913cffd2ff28024fc.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b96862899667595913cffd2ff28024fc.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b96862899667595913cffd2ff28024fc.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:29:54+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:37+00:00","filename":"b96862899667595913cffd2ff28024fc.jpg","authentication":"b329c3e85c92147e82f3a66174d46018","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_174_002_003_o2.jpg","size":1447558,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2793,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047988953866147},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225635"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225635"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225635"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b96862899667595913cffd2ff28024fc.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806177,"FileSize":1447558,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2793\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2793,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:26:35","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 22:56:35","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 22:56:35","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2974,"ExifImageLength":3832,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"but though the snow was three or four feet deep, it was not hard enough then to afford a chance to hunt the moose advantageously.

I am afraid all this account of my woods journey will not be very interesting to you.  I wish I could have been at your Exhibition at the close of last term. I should like to hear some account of it, and also of the 'visit' at Dunbarton, which it would have given me great pleasure to attend, and really quite troubled me that I could not. I do not know that I ever enjoyed any social gathering more than I did that  at your house last year. I want to hear all about it. If your vacation is only one week, I presume you at at Merrimack again now. If there is the slightest possibility that you are not I shall blame myself still more for not writing again last month, and using all my influence for it. And whenever you want more money it will be ready for you.  I shall be anxious to hear from you again immediately, and whether you like the school as much as last term.

One feels somewhat solitary. By the way, what solitude there is in a great city where one is entirely unacquainted. I am never lonesome in the woods, but really I came very near it as I walked these crowded streets last morning.\nWell, I was very fortunate in getting to Church this forenoon in the rain. I entered the nearest, and found it the Old  Brick Presbyterian Church, Garden Spring S.D.  The Church was really pretty well filled in spite of the rain, and I think the Most devout appearing audience I ever saw in a city. And the Sermon was excellent indeed, upon Confidence in God.\nThis afternoon I went away \"Up town,\" to the Church of the Puritan's Dr Cheever's, I do not know how many miles, but it is a great ways, and both places are in the middle of the City! However I got there a long time before service; Being \"Up town\" and Aristocratic, services do not commence till most Four. So I kept walking till then; among the rest looked in to the Magnificent Grace Church, and admired Windows, Ceilings, and Monuments. Dr Cheever preached at his Church, and was eloquent upon the Gospel Call, but I believe I did not like him or his brilliant Church quite as well as Dr Spring and his plain one.\nOne does not walk far in the streets here without realizing that he is out of New England.

Quite a matron I can assure you.   I had a very pleasant visit there, though short. The season out in New York is quite advanced the winter wheat and grass in some places, perhaps a foot high.

I have not been at Meeting today - for there was none to attend.  I went to Sabbath School though, or rather to assist in organizing the Sabbath School for the season, which was fairly accomplished in due form, and with full prospect of interest and good. I think the Sabbath School will be very large in proportion to the whole attendance at Meetings.  There seems a much more hopeful prospect of benefitting the young here than the older, and I am not sure that Ministers might not properly and profitably devote more of their attentions and effort to the children.  I heard one Minister, (Rev Mr. Hayes of Frankfort Me.) say last winter that he had for some years systematically devoted one half of his efforts, both in the pulpit and out, to the juvenile portions of his parish, and his only doubt was whether he should not a still larger portion.  The people here expected to have preaching now all, or about all, of the time; A Free Will Baptist 'Elder\" once a month, a Calvinist Baptist the same, and Congregationalist half the Sabbaths; all in the same house, - or Hall.

I sometimes think that nature must have intended me for a Farmer, and really if I were able to do it as I would like, I might sometime give up other occupations and devote myself to that.  Had I better go out West and make a farm of some beautiful prairie!  You hope that I will not be \"low spirited\". I believe I am not very apt to suffer much in that way.  I never had what people call \"the blues\" and which some really suffer so much from.  I think I rather enjoy the present constitutionally, and instead of looking upon the dark side of the future, am perhaps too much inclined not to think of it at all!

I thing his sermons were about the most elegant I ever heard. The thought was excellent, while the expression was beautiful and polished to the highest degree.

There is a great deal doing in RailRoads in Western New York; a great many new projects. But I am unacquainted there. Nobody knows me.  If I could have been out there for a year or two past so as to be known in almost any capacity. I think I might this Spring have been pretty well situated, perhaps a Chief Engineer on some road. I really have the vanity to believe that there are some not truly better qualified than myself, who are now receiving two or three thousand dollars a year. I spent the Sabbath, June 8th, at Westfield N.Y. with my sister Anne, who I believe I have told you is since Jan. last year a Teacher in Westfield Academy. I enjoyed a day or two in Westfield very much. Westfield is a beautiful place; Mr. Rumsey's where my sister boards is a very pleasant family.  I really felt almost at home at once. Mr Tinker, the Presbyterian Minister at Westfield, formerly I think a Missionary at Sandwich Islands, is an excellent preacher, one of the best.  Monday 9th, was so windy that the Steamboats could not call in at Westfield or Barcelona. So I rode to Erie Penn. by Stage Coach in the night, ad remained there one day.  Then at Cleaveland, Ohio, one day; and at Detroit, Michigan, and today have safely arrived at Chicago Illinois.  One can get about pretty fast nowadays, even and stop a while occasionally.

The great freshet and roads broken up, have prevented his getting here, and we hear this evening that he has taken another route and gone back to Chicago. Thus leaving me in the lurch.\nHowever, I have met here with another gentleman connected with the road, who is pretty fully acquainted with its affairs, and knows where I am most needed. He wishes me to proceed at once to the Southern Division, and I think I will on Monday.  I had preferred to remain somewhere toward the Northern part of the state, thinking that would be more healthy; but it seems their lines are running all back on the high grounds, away from the Marshes, and it may really be the healthiest part of the route.

June 29. 1857\nDear Antoinette\nI believe I must spend a little while this evening in writing to you. I have not been at Church at all today. It has been a very rainy day. The Illinois black mud is very deep. The Church is a long way off, and at the top of a very high bluff.  Therefore being assured by the natives that there would be no meeting I did not undertake to go up. I hear since however that there was a meeting in the A.M.and ten persons present, but this afternoon the minister did not attempt to go.  He is an old school Presbyterian, formerly of Louisville Ky.\nSo I have been in my room all day, reading some, and I must confess, sleeping some.  I was happy to find here in this little Tavern as indeed I have frequently in the West, the Am. Tract Soc. Evan. Fam. Library Series, in which one can always find good reading.\nI have written a letter to my Mother this afternoon, and have been thinking a good deal of way Down East, of Mother, Brothers and Sisters at Milo & Bangor, and of your dear self.\nYou can hardly imagine how anxious I am becoming to hear from you all, or what an age it seems since I have heard.\nOnly to think what a long time it has been, Almost five weeks since I left Bangor, and have not heard from there since, and longer still since I heard from you!\nI believe I wrote to you last from Springfield about a week ago. From Springfield I went to Alton by Stage Coach Oh what a ride across those prairies, sometimes the horizon as unlimited as on the broad ocean, sometimes most beautiful groves of timber; and then the prairie flowers.  But I cannot describe it; and you have seen the Prairies for yourself. I did not stop at Alton. I have had a sort of dislike for Alton and have considered it almost as under a curse, since the death of Lovejoy there.  I went to St. Louis and stopped there one day, and was surprised at its wealth, business & prosperity. From St. Louis I went around to Cairo & to Caledonia on the Ohio River, where I remained one day, and then came around here.

It had been so long since I heard from you; and I was getting very impatient, and anxious. And I have not yet heard from home, Mother, Brother, or Sister. Letters had a little farther to go there you know than to you which would make the answers one or two days later, but I shall now expect them next mail at any rate.\nI am very much obliged to you for writing immediately on the receipt of my letter. A single day when one is waiting is a good while. I should have written the day I received yours, but that there is no mail until Monday.\nAs you may imagine, I have by this time had considerable experience of Life among the Suckers. I have certainly learned a good many new things. We have made a survey 50 miles through Southern Illinois. I can tell you so you can trace our course on the map. If on your maps the Base Lines & Meridians of the N.I. Government Land Surveys are laid down, it is easily traced. We commenced where the \"Third Principal Meridian\", {which is nearly the Meridian of Cairo & Vandalia} crosses Big Muddy River in Jackson County, and run Northerly through Jackson Perry & Washington Counties to the \"Base Line\" which is thirty of forty miles south of Vandalia. The whole distance, eastern people would think almost uninhabited; they call it here pretty well settled, which means simply that there is an occasional Farm, say from one to twelve miles apart I think that in the fifty miles we did pass within ten miles","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102226,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102226","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/f7c3f837ae9544c4e58ccafc4ca331c2.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/f7c3f837ae9544c4e58ccafc4ca331c2.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/f7c3f837ae9544c4e58ccafc4ca331c2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f7c3f837ae9544c4e58ccafc4ca331c2.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:30:39+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:37+00:00","filename":"f7c3f837ae9544c4e58ccafc4ca331c2.jpg","authentication":"04299bba7ceca61b3162ba1f819979ce","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_174_011_002_o2.jpg","size":1458608,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2750,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04911138047138},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225953"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225953"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225953"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f7c3f837ae9544c4e58ccafc4ca331c2.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806179,"FileSize":1458608,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2750\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2750,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:27:41","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 22:59:53","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 22:59:53","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2925,"ExifImageLength":3829,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"of any village containing 100 inhabitants, no not 20 inhabitants, I think. I wrote to you some descriptions of our first stopping place. We found such all the way through, some perhaps a little better, and some worse.  I should have preferred taking a tent with our wagon, and making ourselves as comfortable as we could with our own shelter, but the arrangements were made before I came, partly from the impossibility of finding water except at the houses.  So we boarded everywhere at the Farmer's houses.  On one account I liked the arrangement. It gave greater facilities for getting acquainted with the people, mode of life etc etc. I suppose the people here are quite different from there in the Northern part of Illinois. Here they are mostly from the South, some few from Ohio & Pennsylvania.  About all came here very poor. This is however one of the most fertile regions in the world; almost every kind of crop, cotton, rice, & tobacco, as well as wheat, corn & oats, grown here with very little labor. The people are the most indolent I ever saw and yet every one has big fields of corn and great herds of Cattle and hogs.  They all eat Cornbread & bacon, and drink sour milk and lots of coffee.  They seem to want nothing more, only some sort of log hovel for shelter; or if they ever think of more, are too lazy to work for it.  Still they have many good qualities, are kindhearted hospitable, and if they would take as much pains or exert themselves to better themselves as they will to accommodate or oblige another, they might soon be comfortably off.  A real \"Yankee\" is quite a curiosity to most of these people, and they stare well at first to see a man eat who will drink neither coffee or sour milk. \"As well as\" I can judge however they generally soon form a pretty good opinion of a \"Yankee.\"!

As for drinking vessels there is a great variety as you mention: perhaps the most common however is a gourd shell hollowed out!  Every thing however, it is easily seen, is very rapidly improving throughout this country: new settlers coming in, and the old trying trying far more than ever to improve.  The Country itself is beautiful, beautiful exceedingly. The climate, at this season, seems occasionally rather warm to a New Englander. The People here though complain more of the cold than the heat. One rarely suffers from the heat in the prairie, as there is usually a fine cooling breeze; but where the sun shines in the timber, sheltered from the winds it is hot indeed. And in the prairie if one sits or lies down among the thick grass, the ground is so dry and the sunshine so hot, it seems like a heated oven at once; while standing up, or better sitting on a horse it is very comfortable. The warmest place I have seen is in running a line through the great cornfields, where the corn is eight or ten feet high, as it grows here, and pretty effectually keeps off the air. We completed out Survey No. One a week ago,and came here to make up plans, profiles, and calculations for one week.

I must tell you another thing. You know I came here without promising to stay.  The agreement was simply that I should come out and go to work, and receive $2.50 per diem while I staid. Upon settlement at the end of July I am allowed $3.00 per diem for the whole time. Moreover I find myself set down from August 1st, for $3.50 per diem.  So I begin to think that I can do well out here, if I find that the climate agrees well with me. I find that Southern Illinois has been considered very unhealthy for Eastern men. Part of the time I have thought it was for me.  One while I thought I should certainly leave at the end of July. The water I suppose affected me very much at first; I had quite a Diarrhea or Dysentery rather, which, made me very weak: and in the so very hot languid weather I could not recover strength at all.  Why for a week or two I really seemed incapable of as much  active effort, mental or physical, in a day, as usually in an hour or two. Any effort, under the scorching sun wilted me at once, and fatigued and lamed me for a long time. But within two or three weeks showers have sprung up an cooled the air and the ground. the breezes seem fresher, the atmosphere purer, the earth less parched; and my health and strength seem very well restored. The old settlers say my acclimation is very favorable; I have no doubt that it is much more so than if I had followed the almost universal prescription to put brandy always with my water, and plenty of coffee with my bacon, as too many even of Eastern men do in coming here. I am very glad indeed that you like Illinois: for if I conclude to try and stay out here, I shall very soon be wanting you to come out here with me. I shall not be contented to stay here long alone I can assure you. My love and regard to Father & Mother, brother & sister -  to Mrs Wm. Raymond, if you see her & please. I liked Mrs Raymond best of all my acquaintances in N.H. after Antoinette. I shall be waiting most earnestly to hear from you again soon as possible. Sincerely yours I. S.

Illinois\nSabbath Morning Sept 14, 1851\nDear Antoinette, Your kind letter I received and eagerly read upon my arrival here last night somewhat late. I have just been reading it again this morning.  How long seems the time it take letters to go from here to New England & back. I seem to realise more and more every week how very far away I have placed myself.  I believe the mails arrive here securely, but by no means regularly.  Since I have been here I have received one letter from Bangor one week, and the next one mailed at the same office two weeks earlier than the one first received.  I had begun to get quite impatient and anxious before I got your letter. I should have written again before receiving yours but, thinking of it almost every day, I kept expecting that the next day I should get your letter.  Another trouble here is that I do not always get letters as soon as they arrive here. I am now moving about considerable, and sometimes am not here for nearly a whole month, and when I am away twenty or thirty miles, I find I do well if I her from the Post Office as often as once a week.  The letters I found here last night had been awaiting me here for three or four days.  I believe though that letters are almost doubly prised when I do get them.  As you and other friends caution me a good deal about my health, I must have my turn in hoping you will be careful and not over fatigue yourself in Domestic duties and get sick.  I presume you are an accomplished housekeeper and certainly wish I could add one to the number of your visitors and enjoy your hospitality for a day or two at least.  I wish I could be there today and enjoy a good New England Sabbath.  It is a great privation to be so destitute of Sanctuary privileges as one must be here.

There are many professors of religion here, perhaps nearly as large a part of the population as in New England.  They are mostly Methodists and various sorts of Baptists, but mostly very ignorant; Quite a large part of the old settlers here cannot read or write; and many of them, judging by their conduct & habits, we should think hardly half Christianised.  The customs of the country are so different, and the mode of life and the necessities of the case so strange, that they must be looked upon with much clarity.  Here at Mr Root's place, which is my home here, there is a regular Episcopal Service every Sabbath, Mr Root being what they call a \"Lay Reader.\" I can enjoy his service & sermon pretty well in lack of any better suited to my taste.   Since I wrote before I have had various Sabbath experience. The first Sabbath in Aug. I believe I wrote you.  I was here. The second, I was down in Jackson Co. and went seven miles to Vergennes, where is a Presbyterian Church, but found the minister sick and no preaching.  There was however a Prayer Class Meeting, which I attended.  I had never been at one before. I rather liked it. Did you ever attend one?  It seems to me the institution rightly managed may be a beneficial one in many cases.  I judge it might have all the good there could be in a Roman Catholic Confessional, and some more.  On the whole, I enjoyed the Sabbath much, though there was a violent shower in the Afternoon, and I was obliged to ride back through woods & Prairies without road in the very dark night. However, being an Engineer I found the way without difficulty.  The next Sabbath, Aug. 17, the day you were writing to me, I was at the Presbyterian Church in Du Quion in this county. The 24th I was at this place.

I was not really much sick, thought I could be out every day, but they say here that exposure to the hot sun is the very worst thing, and would soon make me very sick, My symptoms were only pain in my head & neck, and alternate days a few hours of fever heat & thirst. I thought it best to be careful in Season, and so found Comfortable Quarters with Dr Lucas, Blissville, Grand Prairie, Jefferson Co. and \"took it easy.\" In all week 8 or 9 days before last, I went out but two days and then did little or nothing. In Dr H.B. Lucas I found a really kind friend. Last week I was out about all week, doing hardly any thing, however, but ride about, with an umbrella over my head. It has been very unusually warm weather for two or three weeks past, and I find it does not do at all to expose myself to the Sunshine now. If I do not feel a good deal better tomorrow I rather think I shall not go out any more at present, but confine myself to work in the office until my health & strength are fully restored. If I do so I shall probably go down to Jonesboro 30 or 40 miles south of this where I can have much better Office Conveniences than here. I have plenty to do in office but dislike to go now, as I suppose my presence in Field would be worth perhaps $\"100.00 per week to the R.R. interests for a few weeks longer.

The letters of course were not mailed or sent to the Post Office until the next day, but the same Sabbath Afternoon, while the letters lay unsealed upon my table, I was seized with the Ague of the very worst kind. Entirely unexpected it was too. I had got asleep in my room after service, and suddenly waked trembling & shaking with the cold, and the thermometer perhaps at 90 in the shade. \nWell I had it the very worst sort, as I thought, for most of the week, and stupid enough it made me feel I assure you. On alternate afternoons I would have a regular shaking spell, and fever all the evening; the intermediate day, I would have a little chill just about dark; but it made me dull & stupid all the time.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102243,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102243","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/54cd8fba385ee0b436bff896ba9f3bea.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/54cd8fba385ee0b436bff896ba9f3bea.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/54cd8fba385ee0b436bff896ba9f3bea.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/54cd8fba385ee0b436bff896ba9f3bea.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:30:54+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:37+00:00","filename":"54cd8fba385ee0b436bff896ba9f3bea.jpg","authentication":"e01c2441be007bff07b3713f5e7aa977","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_174_013_002_o2.jpg","size":1673803,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2790,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.055549017655648},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230150"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230150"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230150"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"54cd8fba385ee0b436bff896ba9f3bea.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806180,"FileSize":1673803,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2790\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2790,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:28:03","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:01:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:01:50","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3042,"ExifImageLength":3925,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I think it was rather an obstinate attack; at any rate we did not succeed in \"breaking it\" until Friday, and I did not begin to feel like myself until the next week.

All of which matters you may expect to learn as soon thereafter as letters can go.\nI have been at Church today, but cannot say that I like the preaching much.  There are two Churches here. Methodist & Baptist, no Presbyterians I believe in the county. The preaching at both is very poor, besides being only occasional; the preachers of both are uneducated and very ignorant.  However I suppose they are better than none, and  try to be thankful  You enquire for the \"Well Spring\" & \"Messenger\"  They are very rarely seen here.  The Methodist Religious Papers have the most circulation here.  I agree with your father in being interested in Minnesota.  I have many friends there\u00a0; and moreover prefer to Southern Illinois, any place farther North and settled by Eastern people.  There is indeed field enough for effort here but the material seems decidedly poor to a New Englander.\nYou speak of the Cholera.  I have had very little thought of it, I do not think it to be feared by steady temperate men, and especially away from Cities.  You suppose me \"roaming over prairies\".  Not now.

It had been here two or three days I suppose. I have been away for a week, up in the Prairies, at Mt Hawkins my last summer's home, and out to Murphysboro, Pinkneyville, and Nashville, the County - Shire Towns, to obtain certain land records from the County offices. I have got so that I enjoy riding horseback very much, even in the cold weather. The past week has been quite cold and stormy, unusually so for this Country, more snow has fallen than often in whole winters, and all the Suckers are very much curled up by the cold. But I have enjoyed it very much, it has seemed almost like New England weather, though the Cold weather here would be warm for winter weather there.\nI have not been up at Mt Hawkins since I left there last September, and the visit was quite pleasant. Mrs Roots called me rather a bad boy for not coming to see my \"Mother\" oftener. I believe she was as kind to me when sick as a Mother could be. The prairies I find look rather dreary in winter, especially when a cold wintry wind is blowing the snow across them. Even the quails and prairie chickens hardly seem to enjoy it.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102292,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102292","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7f6bd4d938f5363d6137b2834412eb91.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7f6bd4d938f5363d6137b2834412eb91.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7f6bd4d938f5363d6137b2834412eb91.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7f6bd4d938f5363d6137b2834412eb91.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:31:32+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:37+00:00","filename":"7f6bd4d938f5363d6137b2834412eb91.jpg","authentication":"62e380d6a9a677617ccb3dddd0c10b7f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_175_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1898940,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2835,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.062020380168528},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230450"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230450"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230450"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7f6bd4d938f5363d6137b2834412eb91.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806181,"FileSize":1898940,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2835\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2835,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:28:57","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:04:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:04:50","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3087,"ExifImageLength":3920,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I am much obliged for your copy of Rail Road News. If I were now in New England, I would perhaps try to get a place upon that New York and Boston Air Line R.R. Probably however there would be but little chance. There is so little Rail Road building or surveying going on in New England now, and so many there out of business that there is little chance for one without personal acquaintance or favor of those engaged in it.\nThe time for Engineering Employment in N.E. is mostly passed. In New York State there is considerable doing now, under the Nine Million Canal Enlargement, but Canal Engineering I do not consider my business and do not like it either.  The present field for RailWay Engineers seems decidedly to be in the Western States and here a great field is just opening.\nMr Ashley, our new Div. Eng. here, laughs at the idea of remaining at the East now. I like Mr Ashley very well. He is a regular Yankee, though he has been four or five years in the west. Mrs Ashley is quite a pleasant lady, an Episcopalian. They have three little children.

From the Nature of the country it has been decided not to keep the work progressing, or the Irish laborers at work through the hot season.\nHowever we are hoping to hear very soon some decision of the Directors as to what is to be done this Season. It may come any day. It is rather inconvenient to have the management & Direction of a Rail Road so far off. For a while this Winter New York has been nearly a month distant from Southern Illinois. \nThe winter it seems has been very severe all over the country. I see in all the Newspapers accounts of extremely cold weather and great storms everywhere, not only in this country, but in Europe also.\nIt seems you have your full share upon Dunbarton hill this Winter of both cold and storm.\nI think it would be quite a pleasure to me to see a real good snowdrift, one of your fifteen feet drifts for instance.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102310,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102310","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/dfa0509585216e1bbcc94b8c4348c152.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/dfa0509585216e1bbcc94b8c4348c152.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/dfa0509585216e1bbcc94b8c4348c152.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/dfa0509585216e1bbcc94b8c4348c152.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:31:46+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:37+00:00","filename":"dfa0509585216e1bbcc94b8c4348c152.jpg","authentication":"8fbce4ef488a1e792230f6952a73d09a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_175_003_003_o2.jpg","size":1681348,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2869,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.054262938435124},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230550"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230550"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230550"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"dfa0509585216e1bbcc94b8c4348c152.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806182,"FileSize":1681348,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2869\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2869,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:29:17","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:05:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:05:50","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":77,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3128,"ExifImageLength":3924,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I wish I could have been at your annual Festival at Dunbarton & I should have enjoyed it very much.

At any rate the weather here since the last week of January has been that of Spring, as warm mostly as New England May at least. The ground looks very green already in many places, especially the Wheat fields. The buds are swelling rapidly, and some of the earlier forest trees & shrubs have already \"hung all their lapels forth\" Yet there is very likely more cold and frost, perhaps more snow even, before the first of April. Though there has been any frost but two or three times only since the last week of Jan.\nI have been in much trouble for some time, as to when I shall, or can, go East.

Mr. Ashley tells me I must almost unavoidably wait till summer, and rehearses the many conveniences and necessities of delay, and what he calls the impracticability of going East at this Season.\nBut I refuse as yet to give it up, and if our \"Orders\" should arrive tomorrow, I should probably start on the next day. I did expect to get to New Hampshire and Maine before the first of March. If I do not get there this Spring, I shall count the days until my promised Summer vacation, I assure you.\n\"My Minister\" preached today, Mr. Stewart, the Presbyterian Clergyman of whom I wrote to you, and I had quite a treat you may be certain. He has preached here in town but a few times, having no Church, and not wishing to interfere with the regular services of the other Ministers. Today the Baptist Minister is sick and Mr. Stewart has taken his place. He is really quite a preacher for this country, and I believe is very much liked by the people here.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102319,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102319","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/4415b786171e0d2efa53fa11b8c1090c.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/4415b786171e0d2efa53fa11b8c1090c.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/4415b786171e0d2efa53fa11b8c1090c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4415b786171e0d2efa53fa11b8c1090c.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:31:52+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:37+00:00","filename":"4415b786171e0d2efa53fa11b8c1090c.jpg","authentication":"0ddbf70043540bd26558e3cf13727007","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_175_004_003_o2.jpg","size":1742873,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2813,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057368336164106},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230613"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230613"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230613"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4415b786171e0d2efa53fa11b8c1090c.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806182,"FileSize":1742873,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2813\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2813,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:29:27","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:06:13","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:06:13","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":75,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3063,"ExifImageLength":3919,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I have just now returned from Evening Meeting. Mr. Stewart preached, and I think his discourse was even better than in the forenoon, or than I ever heard from him. His text was \"Today, if ye will hear his voice etc.\" I was pleased to see him, with true western feeling, come down from the pulpit, and take his stand in the open space before the desk, saying he could have more liberty there. and when he got into the open space, he certainly did not lack for gesture or action, though quite dignified withal. \nBy the way, thinking of Oratory, I cannot tell how much I want to see & hear Kossuth. If I were at leisure I travel five hundred miles, & give fifty dollars, just to see the man. I do regard him as not only the greatest Orator, but the greatest man now living in the world. Is he not the greatest spirit of the age? And if his life is spared, destined to the greatest influence over the age & world?  If so, what a blessing that he is such a man; so different from many Master Spirits of other ages, for instance. Napoleon Bonaparte, whose influence was so great in the beginning of this century.\n\n You are very right in surmising that I am proud of My State. Has not Maine done nobly? May others soon follow its example. Every letter I get from there contains something about the success and beneficial working of the Liquor Law, or as it is called \"The Maine Law.\" \n\nI am very much hoping that Old Massachusetts will pass a similar law this Winter. What is New Hampshire about to do upon the Subject? I see that New York and even some of the Western States are agitating the Subject. The Quart Law of this state of Illinois is one step.

It is a real Spring Morning, such an one as can be expected in New Hampshire or Maine sometime in May, perhaps hardly till towards the last of the months though!\n\nAs I sit here I look from my window and see - the one side to be sure the old rusty Court house and the Public Square ankle-deep with mud from yesterday's rain - but on the other a garden with long rows of vegetables bursting from the Earth, various shrubbery in full leaf, bright grass flats etc.; in the distance on the one side a mighty forest whose grand old trees stretch their giant limbs against the rising sun, some of them even beginning to glow with the hues of Spring; on the other side stretch away broad bright wheat fields already  almost waving in the breeze. Does not even that description give you an idea of spring? One quite different from that of March in New Hampshire. You will think my window must be a very pleasant one. So indeed it would be, if what I have described were all; but in fact, all that is only seen in glimpses through among & over the various dirty dingy looking, unpainted buildings, some of logs half hewed, some of warped & twisted boards, some with big ill looking old chimneys on the outside, and some with big ill-looking old chimneys on the outside, and some without; but I believe all decidedly ill looking and disorderly.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102325,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102325","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/eba10bb525b54f144ba6ac19406d04dd.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/eba10bb525b54f144ba6ac19406d04dd.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/eba10bb525b54f144ba6ac19406d04dd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/eba10bb525b54f144ba6ac19406d04dd.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:31:57+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:38+00:00","filename":"eba10bb525b54f144ba6ac19406d04dd.jpg","authentication":"2fab5d9f25e8abf6bb950ff08926ddbb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_175_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1714223,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2871,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.055285389011443},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230636"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230636"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230636"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"eba10bb525b54f144ba6ac19406d04dd.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806182,"FileSize":1714223,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2871\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2871,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:29:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:06:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:06:36","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3085,"ExifImageLength":3867,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"your good letter of Feb. 27 came safely to hand last evening and a little one of Feb. 21, a day or two before;

I have usually but very little time to spare from business upon other days. Especially as I finish entirely upon week days many kinds of business that other Engineers habitually perform on the Sabbath. Then there is no such thing in this country as a Afternoon Meeting. Services are universally at 11 A.M. and in the evening. So the Afternoon is spent by all classes, members of the Churches as well as others in walking or riding about, visiting etc. Even the Clergymen do the same, at any rate,  keep open house on Sabbath Afternoon, and invite any one to call at that time specially. My New England habits & feelings prejudices they would be called here, do not exactly permit this though I am probably entirely alone in the whole region in uniformly refusing all invitations to walk, ride, or visit on the Sabbath.  So you see I am quite a Solitary, and have a long Sabbath Afternoon every week, entirely to myself, and a very fine time it is to read, or to write letters to Mother, brothers, Sisters, and you.\n Your letter of March 13, was joyfully received  on Apr. 1. with at the same time letters from Bangor.

A letter received yesterday relieve my mind very much. He had gone to Dr. Munde's Water Cure Establishment at NorthHampton, had got better, and was about returning to Bangor.  I was the more alarmed about it as his disease was occasioned by an injury something like that which produced dear Joseph's disease. I perhaps wrote to you about his getting hurt last winter a year ago. I suppose it likely that he saved the lives of a couple of girls by throwing himself against a runaway horse which tried to jump over the sleigh in which he and the girls were riding. The force of the blow was so great as to crush into fragments the sleigh even though the horse himself did not touch it at all, being fairly crowded aside by my brother's shoulders. His back was hurt however, and has been lame ever since until a few weeks ago he was attacked with violent pain in the back & acute inflamation of the kidneys, occasioned the doctors say by the same injury a year since. I hope now, this being thrown off, that he may experience no further ill from it.\n\n We here at last received the long expected action of the Ill. Central R.R. Co.

Sabbath day you know is my day to write letters to you and my Mother. And if I do not do it tonight, I might neglect in among the business of the week.\n\nThe Methodists have had a Sabbath School Convention here in Jonesboro today, commenced on Friday last. There are an abundance of their preachers, both local and itinerant from all this part of the State present here.\nSome of them preach pretty well, and some of them call for some slight exercise of Charity I think.  The one who preached this evening, A Tailor from Nottingham England, a Local preacher at Marion in this State I liked pretty well. Plainly without advantages of early education, he is evidently a student, probably a hard student, and being young, I consider really promising. One very serious fault though he had tonight he tried to speak too long; it seemed almost two hours, and was certainly an hour too long!\nI have heard three sermons preached today which is something quite unusual here, besides attending Lore? feast, and hearing various speeches and exhortations from the different preachers and others who had been present","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102341,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102341","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d96493d12c7dd5d7f0da1466a3466a55.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d96493d12c7dd5d7f0da1466a3466a55.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d96493d12c7dd5d7f0da1466a3466a55.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d96493d12c7dd5d7f0da1466a3466a55.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:32:11+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:38+00:00","filename":"d96493d12c7dd5d7f0da1466a3466a55.jpg","authentication":"6f93747b02987b60e6959c1c0026f7e3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_175_007_002_o2.jpg","size":1478678,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2238,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.061177225035581},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230739"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230739"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230739"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d96493d12c7dd5d7f0da1466a3466a55.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806183,"FileSize":1478678,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2238\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2238,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:29:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:07:39","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:07:39","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3057,"ExifImageLength":4917,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Your letter of March 27 was gladly received a day or two since.

Warm weather came on the last of January. February I think was warmer than I ever knew April at the East: it seemed most like May. Vegetation seemed to starting very rapidly. But about the first of March winter seemed to come again about a winter fit for this climate. Cold, win, rain, and frost. Vegetation seemed to stop and stand still almost for six weeks. Some early leaves which had been coming out fell off and others have been from then until now in getting fairly out; so with the blossoms of the fruit trees etc. etc.\n\nIt has seemed very strange. I suppose vegetation always starts very slowly here compared with the North where every plant and tree seems to realize that its season is short. Some Spring flowers which are common to both climates, and which at the North are in blossom  as soon as the snow is fairly off are here hardly out now where there has been no snow for almost three months. I suppose the plants have just such a time to perfect themselves, forming their roots etc. and come out at about the same time of year in all climates.\n\n I am glad to hear that your Reading Circle prospers so well.

They were of the class of men, young men, who were active and the leaders of Europe in 1848. One is a young Pole, who served as a huzzar officer in Hungary. Another is a Prussian, who was in Government service as R.R. engineer, but was one of the leaders of popular revolution in Berlin in '48.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102349,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102349","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/05d1da749c1925be6448f2868d610158.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/05d1da749c1925be6448f2868d610158.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/05d1da749c1925be6448f2868d610158.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/05d1da749c1925be6448f2868d610158.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:32:16+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:38+00:00","filename":"05d1da749c1925be6448f2868d610158.jpg","authentication":"bfd6917b7bc9717b04119fee647187e5","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_175_008_002_o2.jpg","size":1790008,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2763,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.059986059168108},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230803"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230803"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230803"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"05d1da749c1925be6448f2868d610158.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806183,"FileSize":1790008,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2763\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2763,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:30:01","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:08:03","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:08:03","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3014,"ExifImageLength":3926,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"They were ardent enthusiasts in the cause of Liberty, but, like most perhaps of these fellows too far from the earnest religious faiths of Kossuth.\nYoung Europe, as it is sometimes called, is, I fear, now too much in religion and morality like the French of the old French Revolution.

I fear there has been a Mail lost with letters for me. The Mails have been very irregular lately, occasioned, I suppose, by heavy rains and high water. The Eastern Newspapers for one week we have failed entirely of receiving. Last Sunday night and Monday Morning was the greatest storm I ever saw. I believe there is never any thing like it in New England. It was really almost dreadfully magnificent. There seemed to be one continual rolling peal of thunder, and one constant uninterrupted flash of lightning, and such torrents of rain!  There was considerable damage done, as once before this spring, by the washing away of fences, destruction of roads, bridges and crops.

When this Messenger left it was thought that John would not live.\n\nI shall probably remain with Col.

Niagara Falls. June 1, 1854\nBangor Mane June 6, 1854\n\n                                                                                                Niagara Fall's June 1st  '54\n\nMy Dearest Ettie\n\n  I mailed a letter to you yesterday from New York City. But, as I have a little leisure believe I will write again this afternoon. I seem to have luck for travelling o'nights. I could not get ready to leave New York in time for Morning trains yesterday as they leave early, and I must be there somewhat in business hours. So I finished my business in forenoon; & P.M. went up to Crystal Palace. But it was only an aggravation, as it were. One seems to want weekdays if not weeks, instead of hours; and the paltry hour or so I could spend was hardly time enough to walk round it all. I ought at any rate to spend a day or two in the Machinery department. I left N.Y. City at 6 P.M. yesterday 31st Ult. riding all night, frosty night it was too through New York. There was no fire in the cars, & I almost needed my cloak.

But I am afraid she has one very bad fault - you may have heard me speak of the same in somebody else - caring for other people more than for ones' self. Now isn't this a sin?

Mankind generally being too supremely selfish to be affected thereby.

But the Thermometer shows 92 F here now at 9 A.M. I tell you it is warm. One feels it the more after the hot nights. The languid heat of the day. I think since the 25th June the Thermometer has not been below 80 F (if as low, at any time day or night. I was very wet and cold here till near the Middle 10th of June; since that there has been hardly a shower, hot weather all the tie. The ground is baked as dry & hard & burns the feet like a hot brick. One can hardly walk without thick soles. The dust in the roads - well I won't try. I moved up here last Tuesday. I have got the Office in corner of Freight House, 10 ' high 12' sq. finished off, lathed & plastered, window & doors. There I have established my safe, desk, tables and a big new book case. Over head I have set up my little camp cot bed, with every necessary convenience; For my meals I go over to our boarding house kept very tolerably by E.N. Smith, and inhabited by various Smiths, Skinners, and Carpenters, of whom Charles W.R. being Chief has the best, a very comfortable room which however he shares with S. Conant, who having an old fashioned prejudice against Water isn't a good companion this weather.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102418,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102418","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/6550d3416b94d43cfab00ffdf845b40a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/6550d3416b94d43cfab00ffdf845b40a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/6550d3416b94d43cfab00ffdf845b40a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6550d3416b94d43cfab00ffdf845b40a.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:33:13+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:37+00:00","filename":"6550d3416b94d43cfab00ffdf845b40a.jpg","authentication":"edb6d5725052918c0ea046f5801e40ec","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_176_007_002_o2.jpg","size":1776208,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2759,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.059609896231861},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231223"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231223"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231223"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6550d3416b94d43cfab00ffdf845b40a.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806185,"FileSize":1776208,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2759\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2759,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:31:29","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:12:23","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:12:23","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3270,"ExifImageLength":4266,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I was going down to the old Town to Church today; though there will be no preaching, I should only have to read a sermon: but it is so very, very hot, that I am about to back out.

Yours of May 31st arrived here June 10th two weeks ago yesterday: but awful ---there was none for two weeks. Yours of June7, did not arrive until yesterday 24th and then with it, the one of June 13th and also one from Mother. So I had quite a feast.  Oh Ettie I love you for every letter you write to me. I am glad you like \"Euthanasia\". Of course you get other copies of that & Bryant, if you like, to give to any one; and I would do so. There is a great pleasure in giving as well as receiving good gifts (greatest in giving where they will be prized) and I would not dent myself the pleasure. You surely ought to make some good presents to Lucy & Maria, Let them be good ones. Valuable - costing something, and at the same time good otherwise. Remember that you have money enough - if not in your purse - in Eliab's. He has money of mine, and will honor your drafts.\nI thank you for proposing the reading to chapters of French Testament every Sabbath. I have hunted up the French testament from the bottom of Trunk & and read this morning the 7 & 8 chapters of John which is the lesson for today I believe. We will try to keep up the practice.\n Do not worry about my health. It is very good. I am better & stronger than last summer; and feel the heat less. The trip east did me good. I feel better for it every way: the change & the relaxation were beneficious.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102425,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102425","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/100cf9581bfd34e9a882454c0cb7f883.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/100cf9581bfd34e9a882454c0cb7f883.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/100cf9581bfd34e9a882454c0cb7f883.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/100cf9581bfd34e9a882454c0cb7f883.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:33:17+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:37+00:00","filename":"100cf9581bfd34e9a882454c0cb7f883.jpg","authentication":"efc6f87d698a40455d88a29018d4d1d5","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_176_008_002_o2.jpg","size":1738582,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2756,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05841067300973},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231250"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231250"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231250"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"100cf9581bfd34e9a882454c0cb7f883.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806185,"FileSize":1738582,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2756\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2756,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:31:39","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:12:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:12:50","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3249,"ExifImageLength":4243,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I have been very busy since I got back here; every thing behind hand you know, and many things to look after.

I get quite tired of reading, as it was hot, and the air very close.\nRefused very many invitations to dinner, stopping only at Dr. Wall's to Enquire after Mr. Noel who is there sick, as also Mr. Aspen, we returned here. Mr. Noel was taken a week or more since with Billious Fever I expect.\nSent for Dr. Wall who presented 40 grains of Calomel, Noel said 60 grains would have cured him, but the Dr. would give only 40 & so he sick, and worse salivated. Noel you know is hard headed; has years ago in habit of drinking his quart of Brandy per diem; and it takes a great doze of medicine to effect him. J.C. Smith & J. N. Mitchell started for the East Friday or Saturday. to be gone a month.\nI told you I got yesterday a letter from Dunbarton. Father & Mother. I would write a special answer to it; but perhaps it is needless, as I shall direct this letter to you there; as I presume you will reach there by the time this does.\nFather wants to know about my plans. You can tell him all about it as well as I can I guess. I believe there is nothing next. I have already explained to you how our lack of Ton & delay here on the Track is like to keep me closely confined here all the Summer","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102437,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102437","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d188179dc8204ab2ccbaec7b174098d2.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d188179dc8204ab2ccbaec7b174098d2.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d188179dc8204ab2ccbaec7b174098d2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d188179dc8204ab2ccbaec7b174098d2.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:33:26+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:37+00:00","filename":"d188179dc8204ab2ccbaec7b174098d2.jpg","authentication":"b18b1f72ff58debadda64d67711cdfc2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_176_009_004_o2.jpg","size":1703862,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2790,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.056546594982079},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231325"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231325"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231325"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d188179dc8204ab2ccbaec7b174098d2.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806185,"FileSize":1703862,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2790\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2790,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:31:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:13:25","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:13:25","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":34,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3286,"ExifImageLength":4239,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Summer & fall I cannot probably get away at all, till I get through here; and can tell noting yet when that will be, Suppose I could not get away next fall; and you & George could come out to me to a comfortable home at Centralia!

Great Excursion Train from Cairo & Jonesboro. They might have liked it if I would have put a big Train on this Division & carried down a Thousand or so of people.  But I would not do it. In that extreme hot weather there would be no comfort in it to begin with. And then I do not like great excursion Trains any how, if I can avoid them, and especially here on a new road, with open cars, and so much whiskey with such people as are here. There is too much risk about it. I should hardly expect to carry a thousand people down to Muddy on 4th July & get them all back alive.\nHowever I saw three celebration celebrating that day in Washington & Clinton Counties. Mr. Smith came up from Big Muddy on Sunday 2d and stopped with me.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102444,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102444","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/327f04be8644be2570949cfda6beac85.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/327f04be8644be2570949cfda6beac85.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/327f04be8644be2570949cfda6beac85.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/327f04be8644be2570949cfda6beac85.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:33:31+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:37+00:00","filename":"327f04be8644be2570949cfda6beac85.jpg","authentication":"862054d4b0d4d97536dc205a7dfcf09c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_176_011_002_o2.jpg","size":1793083,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2797,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.059358671327745},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231355"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231355"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231355"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"327f04be8644be2570949cfda6beac85.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806185,"FileSize":1793083,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2797\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2797,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:32:03","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:13:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:13:55","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3290,"ExifImageLength":4234,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"We started about daylight Monday Morning 3d went up to Mt. Hawkins to Breakfast where the folks were most all sick; then on to Little Muddy spending the day there and went up to Richmond just at night when cool. Mr. Smith left his carriage at Little Muddy, for Given to carry certain Ladies to a Ball with; and he rode with me for the rest of the week mainly. At Richmond we found great preparations for the 4th a barbecue etc. Monday evening we saw the cooking going on. It would have amused you. I must try to describe it. Imagine first long trenches dug in the ground say 3 or 4 ft. wide & 2 or 3 ft. deep & almost any length. Across these trenches laid lots of round green sticks, say two or three inches through & peeled. On these sticks for a gridiron lay the Meat, quarters & halves & sides & peices & strips of oxen, & cows, & sheep & hogs etc. etc. Near by an immense fire, piles and cords of wood burning. Lots of smutty & sweaty looking man, some piling on wood to replenish the fire, and more scraping out the live coals, & throwing into the before mentioned trenches, under the meat.  It was quite a scene in the night, I can assure.\nThe next day without stopping to see the Assemblage at Richmond which amounted to some thousands, Sons of Temperance Odd Fellows etc. etc. We went on North on the R.R. Line, paying considerable attention to that in its various manifestations. At South Centralia ( The Mile south of the Centralia Station, (quite a village which has sprung up there within a few months) we passed another Celebration, quite a crowd, a thousand or two, with a tall flag, a small cannon, an orator & a PicNic Dinner in a Little Grove. We were urgently solicited to remain but went on. We were there about Noon. Stopping awhile at Centralia Station we went on to Central City two miles beyond. There was another similar crowd & adjuncts; they claimed 4 or 5 thousand people flags, cannon, & 2 or 3 orators, Judge Underwood for one. The Crowd just beginning to disperse when we got there. We went to  Dunning's, the most comfortable place it is in the country now. The Family you know consists of Mrs. Hurd the Mother of the Dunnings, mentioned first as most important, George Dunning, & Fanny his wife with Little Charley.

In the Evening, in fact all night nearly, was a great Ball at a tavern house near by, where partitions being removed, large Numbers danced on rough floors, or out on a mess of sawdust under the trees; a few miserable brass instruments (called a Band) for music, & other adjuncts probably in proportion.\nWell every body danced but this one.

How did you know I did not wear any thing on my neck in warm weather? I do though, have none ever since I got back here, a bit of a stock, a few horse hairs slightly covered with a few threads of silk; keeps up better than any handkerchief & is cooler & lighter than any thing else. They are very nice ones you sent, & so in the Pocket & I have got one on my neck today.\nI puzzled a long time to think who the Miss Herd you mentioned as coming to Dinner could be; but I finally thought. She was Mrs. Foss; and a very pleasant sort of woman. What could have possessed her to marry him. Now Charles speaks of it I remember all about him as well as her, a wretched hog.\nQuart of Peanuts! What an investment! I suppose Apples cost so much you could n't buy them. You say nothing of oranges, Pine Apples & Bananas. I take it you did not even dare to enquire the price of them. You did not say how much Samuel got for his horse. What is \"Father Bang!!\"? the book you got for Parish Side. Going a Shopping again- again!  How afraid I am you will wastefully spend your money! I expect you could see the prints of your fingers on those gold peices where you have held on to them - couldn't you? You ought to write to me how the store hold out, how many peices you have left. I wish you would spend enough to dress respectively - decently at least; and that you would contrive to do it for both yourself & baby without sewing so yourself so. Perhaps too you could make Mallie & Lucy sundry nice presents. Suppose now you get them each a good silk dress. Wouldn't it be a good plan? Remember now have been enjoying their hospitality these two months. I really believe we ought to. In right we ought to pay them for Sabra's board. But I suppose they would not take it. Come Ettie, if you will get each of them a $25.00 dollar silk dress, you may have another yourself. That is right. Go now to Eliab and get 100.00 giving him a receipt in my name and use it in that way. Do now.\nIt is wicked to put so many stitches into clothes- very wicked - that is especially doing it yourself. If you could hire people  who business it is, and  pay them fairly for it it would not be so bad  If you can not get work done for you just let it go. At any rate do not Ettie - for my sake - so so sew so yourself. By the way you write me nothing at all about your health - how do you think I have to do to find any thing about it. Crosby got a letter from home the other day, & his mother wrote that your health was improving. I rejoiced at the news it was more than I had heard from you.

Wednesday I went with Mr. Watson etc. down over the First Div. to Cairo, or as near as we could get to there. There are two or three miles of Track yet to lay there at Cairo.\nWe have laid no more Track here yet, and cannot you understand until it is completed to Cairo. If we could only have had Iron here you perceive we could have had our Track nearly laid now. But there has been no high water to get Iron up Muddy, and we have to wait until we can get it from Cairo. And it is very bad laying Track there now, as they are trying to. It is too hot weather for me to work much any where: and about twice as bad there as any where else.

Just to think though of People complaining of heat (as you write about) at Bangor: how ridiculous!\nBut this Country is greivously affected now. The heaves are brass, the Earth Iron, and the rain of the land powder & dust. There has hardly been any rain at all since I got here. This flat country you know suffers from Drouth much more than a broken country. The Corn is all drying up, leaves all rolled together and withered away. The barley planted is ruined entirely, and nothing but rain within a few days can save any part of the Crop. As for the dust in the roads you can have no idea of it hardly. It is rivers of it in the roads, Clouds & Walls of it in the Air, and heavy coats of it upon every thing.\nWater too is getting very scarce throughout the country. If it does not rain very soon there must be very much suffering, of beasts if not of men. The country is dependent upon Wells entirely, and they are failing every where. We appear to have got large supplies of water here at this station, & people come far to get it and haul away.\nYou enquire how I do for Shirts, very well I presume. I soil some ? occasionally this warm weather, but by sending out to a washerwoman occasionally I have as yet found no lack & presume I will not. I think the supply is quite good. By the way, I have seen what I think must be a very good thing for this hot weather; That is a Shirt and vest all together, all one peice. The linen bosom of the shirt is open & buttons up just like a vest, and shows simply as a white linen vest buttoning up to the chin.

Mrs Smith is, as you say I believe, in an extremely flourishing condition. Mr Campbell is detained from his work here on acct of the imminent similar condition of his wife across Mr Keye's yard you know. Mrs. P.G. Wellis at unclear has another child since a week. This is a flourishing country you perceive.\nSamuel Conant has started home today; got a letter that his wife was sick, and would stay no longer; afraid to go too, I expect. He is just about as nervous & frightened enough to get the Cholera, if any one. This whole region is perfectly healthy, & the cities are improving I believe in that respect.\nIf I do not get back here until Saturday night, I will expect to find two letters from you\nMost Sincerely\nIsaac.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102458,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102458","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/2958a26dcd7977aabd3275e8f94bf0a9.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/2958a26dcd7977aabd3275e8f94bf0a9.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/2958a26dcd7977aabd3275e8f94bf0a9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2958a26dcd7977aabd3275e8f94bf0a9.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:33:42+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:37+00:00","filename":"2958a26dcd7977aabd3275e8f94bf0a9.jpg","authentication":"ee462d45a92c01e8e6c44dae82f185f0","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_176_013_001_o2.jpg","size":1744422,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2814,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057398918107873},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231445"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231445"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231445"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"2958a26dcd7977aabd3275e8f94bf0a9.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806186,"FileSize":1744422,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2814\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2814,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:32:19","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:14:45","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:14:45","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3285,"ExifImageLength":4202,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Isaac. Ducoign July 30, 1854\nDunbarton Aug 8, 1854\nDucoign, Sabbath. July 30th 1854\nDearest Ettie\nIt is a bright & beautiful Sabbath Morning. All nature seems to be rejoicing in the light of Day. There is a little while in the morning here which is very fine. The Thermometer is not about 80 degrees F. till 7 or 8 oclock. The morning dew freshens things a little, and every thing seems glad. I was a little too fast though in my statement of the thermometer. It is hardly 7 yet, and the Thermometer now stands at 86 degrees F. It stood a long time yesterday at 100 degrees F. in the coolest situation we have here. And I presume will be as high today. I hardly see how we bear it: but it doesn't affect me, and doe n't seem to others. I expect we have got used to it. The first hot weather in June was very hard on me, and seemed to affect every one much more than now. Now any thing below 90 degrees F seems a very comfortably cool temperature. One thing is cooler nights than we had in June which brace up the system & make it to endure the rigor of the day.\nThe Drouth is excessive. You can hardly imagine it. The Old Yard at Mr. Keye's house (I was down there yesterday to see Mitchell who is still sick there), looks as if burned over: There is no green thing, dry & crisp as can be about. As for fruit there is none, or hardly likely to be, of any kind. And Farmers here pretty much given up the idea of having even any corn crop this year. Even the corn is dryed up. Last week I did not get any letter from Ettie. So that last Sunday I had none to reply to. I went up to Centralia on Monday; but succeeded in getting back on Thursday; when I found your good letter of July 12th, Mother's before you left Bangor","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102460,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102460","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/a5250c8a2198582807b8861c9be46638.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/a5250c8a2198582807b8861c9be46638.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/a5250c8a2198582807b8861c9be46638.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a5250c8a2198582807b8861c9be46638.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:33:44+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:37+00:00","filename":"a5250c8a2198582807b8861c9be46638.jpg","authentication":"4819912847658795c873548a81c3ba4c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_176_013_002_o2.jpg","size":1789595,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2795,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.059285595971642},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231500"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231500"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231500"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a5250c8a2198582807b8861c9be46638.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806186,"FileSize":1789595,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2795\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2795,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:32:22","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:15:00","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:15:00","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3278,"ExifImageLength":4222,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I was quite Anxious to hear of your journey, and safe arrival at Dunbarton; and hoped I would get a letter from there on Saturday but it did not come. I got however a letter from Mother at Milo, and one from Eliab at Bangor of 17th inst. telling that you had started from there. You ask where is Dr. Wall going. I do not know yet. I am glad you like Eliab and all the Maine folks: write me all about them all, - what did you think of them. Glad you bought some books for them: why not more? Who is Mrs. Isaac Hatch who called to see you. I am sure I do not know.\nAll the letters from Milo are full of Disappointments because Charles does not come home this summer. Albina, I judge is entirely unreconciled, hardly able to submit to it at all. Mother proposes to go to Bangor with Dr. DeWitt & Wife when they return from Milo; and perhaps go on to Ohio with them. If so I suppose she would call at Dunbarton & see you. Her only hesitation seems to be about leaving Maria this Summer. I do not know but she ought to stay on that account. But I do want her to go to Ohio; as well as to Dunbarton. Mother seems most troubled about not having more chance to see, and get acquainted with Little Mayo. They tell a great story from Milo, of the Little Charley's labors in getting up a Liberty Pole on the Fourth of July. \nDid I tell you in my last letter of Samuel Conant's leaving here.

My wagon is undergoing repairs, & it is altogether to bad for horseback.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102464,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102464","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/4c7e2f21bb9e0316d735cabb71798aeb.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/4c7e2f21bb9e0316d735cabb71798aeb.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/4c7e2f21bb9e0316d735cabb71798aeb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4c7e2f21bb9e0316d735cabb71798aeb.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:33:47+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:37+00:00","filename":"4c7e2f21bb9e0316d735cabb71798aeb.jpg","authentication":"2b15311c05f4068f7187d9c6e3dd0930","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_176_013_004_o2.jpg","size":1776380,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2791,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058932149634407},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231508"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231508"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231508"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4c7e2f21bb9e0316d735cabb71798aeb.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806186,"FileSize":1776380,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2791\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2791,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:32:27","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:15:08","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:15:08","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":87,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3285,"ExifImageLength":4237,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Why do you not write to me all about what you read, and what you think about it.

His condition, prospects &c. &c.\nThe thing I am a little afraid there at Dunbarton you are a little to apt to shut your self up in the house too much - not walk & ride out doors enough. Of course you will have Mayo out doors every day. Have him if you have not a nice little light two wheel carriage. Of course do not rely upon that old borrowed one with bed bugs in it. And do go out yourself every day. Walk about and visit all the neighbors more than ever you did in your life. And ride about too -- and write to me everything you see -- If your father has not got a horse you can drive safely yourself -- or ride horseback -- ride out with father every time he goes any where: he will let you I guess if you coach him smartly. Your great business it is to enjoy yourself & Mayo, and to get a fine stock of health & strength for both of you -- and -- write and let me know all about it\nMost Sincerely Isaac S.M.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}]

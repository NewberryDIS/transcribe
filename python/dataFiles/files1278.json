I sat down Monday Evening, Dec. 30th, and began to write to you; when Brother EIiab came in with a letter from Milo that Brother Joseph was suddenly worse. We came up to Milo as soon as possible on Tuesday but we found him dead. He died Tuesday morning.  He was taken Saturday morning 28th with a slight difficulty of breathing, and apparent effort to throw off something from the Lungs. But it was thought only the effect of a slight cold, and he was soon easier, and remained so Sunday and part of Monday. It appeared that the Paralysis suddenly attacked the Muscles about the Lungs, and rapidly progressed until it stopped his breath. But, as himself said, \"he believed he has everything prepared\"   He had constantly expected a fatal termination of his disease even when he seemed to others to be improving in health. When he was taken worse, he understood it, and he said at once that it would be useless to do anything for him. On Monday night when he was seised with the final distress for breath, he merely inquired of the Physician who was present \"How long will it take me?\" He expressed his readiness to go, and his thankfulness that he was not left, as","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102190,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102190","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c96dbe667616bc2bbbe788d9059f5308.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/c96dbe667616bc2bbbe788d9059f5308.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/c96dbe667616bc2bbbe788d9059f5308.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c96dbe667616bc2bbbe788d9059f5308.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:29:47+00:00","modified":"2020-09-18T02:49:38+00:00","filename":"c96dbe667616bc2bbbe788d9059f5308.jpg","authentication":"44f7fa3d86b1970c27bfb691ab05e4b7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_174_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1510959,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2852,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04905456210067},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225558"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225558"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225558"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c96dbe667616bc2bbbe788d9059f5308.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806177,"FileSize":1510959,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2852\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2852,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:26:24","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 22:55:58","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 22:55:58","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3064,"ExifImageLength":3867,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"he had feared he should be, until the disease should reach his brain, and the mind be weakened.

Not the slightest complaint or murmur ever passed his lips, although he suffered acutely; in that respect his death was that of a stoic. In his last hours as ever before he appeared thoughtful only for others, almost unconscious of himself.  His mind was perfectly clear and unclouded to the very last; and his very death seemed but the last and most perfect triumph of a pure soul and a firm and lofty intellect over the wreck of matter, and the accidents of time.  Oh how beautiful was his corpse! It seemed, in its marble coldness, the perfect embodiment of purity and intellect. We could not weep for him: we ought rather to rejoice: Yet who that knew his worth. {Few could know half his worth}, could but weep at the untimely grave of so many hopes, of so much promise?

I have been for several weeks away from here, in fact, I could almost say, away from everywhere, making a tour through the Lumbering Region in the North and East part of this state. Your previous kind and excellent letters I received before I started and ought to have replied to at the time, but in thinking of other things I neglected or put it off at the time, and after I got into the woods there was no chance to write, though I believe I thought of it every day wherever I was. By the way I could tell you great accounts of my adventures and experiences of life in the Back woods. I went with my Brotherinlaw, Mr Furber, who is agent for large proprietors of Timber lands and is so obliged to look over the Lumbering operations occasionally, exploring the lands and surveying the lumber where it is out. I can hardly tell how long we were without sleeping in a bed or going into any house other than the Log crossed out \"camps\" of the Lumbermen. The sight of these camps would amuse you.

The fire inside may consist of some half a cord of wood, cut about eight feet long and burning in the middle of camp. On each side of this are laid down hemlock bought for a bed on which the men sleep in a row with their feet toward the fire. In some camps there are only six or eight men in some twenty or thirty, or even more.  We travelled from on camp to another, sometimes in the roads by which the Lumbermen carry in their supplies of provisions and hay, sometimes on the ice of the rivers and numerous lakes, and sometimes through the woods a foot on snow shoes, and guided by a pocket Compass or an occasional tree blased by some previous explorer.  I really enjoyed this life in the woods considerably with its great variety now communing with those rough and hardy lumbermen, and now with the great lakes, and mountains, and waterfalls; again watching the game and the winter birds in their native home, especially the Cropbills which even in the coldest weather make the sunny mornings vocal as spring around the camps; and then again assisting in counting or measuring the lumber, admiring perhaps 'fit mast for some admiral'; or perhaps for additional variety hunting or fishing a while. Grouse were abundant; we saw deer and lynxes, and moose the largest game and the largest animal of this climate, are to be found.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102195,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102195","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b96862899667595913cffd2ff28024fc.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b96862899667595913cffd2ff28024fc.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b96862899667595913cffd2ff28024fc.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b96862899667595913cffd2ff28024fc.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:29:54+00:00","modified":"2020-09-18T02:54:35+00:00","filename":"b96862899667595913cffd2ff28024fc.jpg","authentication":"b329c3e85c92147e82f3a66174d46018","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_174_002_003_o2.jpg","size":1447558,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2793,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047988953866147},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225635"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225635"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225635"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b96862899667595913cffd2ff28024fc.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806177,"FileSize":1447558,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2793\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2793,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:26:35","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 22:56:35","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 22:56:35","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2974,"ExifImageLength":3832,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"but though the snow was three or four feet deep, it was not hard enough then to afford a chance to hunt the moose advantageously.

I am afraid all this account of my woods journey will not be very interesting to you.  I wish I could have been at your Exhibition at the close of last term. I should like to hear some account of it, and also of the 'visit' at Dunbarton, which it would have given me great pleasure to attend, and really quite troubled me that I could not. I do not know that I ever enjoyed any social gathering more than I did that  at your house last year. I want to hear all about it. If your vacation is only one week, I presume you at at Merrimack again now. If there is the slightest possibility that you are not I shall blame myself still more for not writing again last month, and using all my influence for it. And whenever you want more money it will be ready for you.  I shall be anxious to hear from you again immediately, and whether you like the school as much as last term.

One feels somewhat solitary. By the way, what solitude there is in a great city where one is entirely unacquainted. I am never lonesome in the woods, but really I came very near it as I walked these crowded streets last morning.\nWell, I was very fortunate in getting to Church this forenoon in the rain. I entered the nearest, and found it the Old  Brick Presbyterian Church, Garden Spring S.D.  The Church was really pretty well filled in spite of the rain, and I think the Most devout appearing audience I ever saw in a city. And the Sermon was excellent indeed, upon Confidence in God.\nThis afternoon I went away \"Up town,\" to the Church of the Puritan's Dr Cheever's, I do not know how many miles, but it is a great ways, and both places are in the middle of the City! However I got there a long time before service; Being \"Up town\" and Aristocratic, services do not commence till most Four. So I kept walking till then; among the rest looked in to the Magnificent Grace Church, and admired Windows, Ceilings, and Monuments. Dr Cheever preached at his Church, and was eloquent upon the Gospel Call, but I believe I did not like him or his brilliant Church quite as well as Dr Spring and his plain one.\nOne does not walk far in the streets here without realizing that he is out of New England.

Quite a matron I can assure you.   I had a very pleasant visit there, though short. The season out in New York is quite advanced the winter wheat and grass in some places, perhaps a foot high. Last week was cold there though as well as here. Why, here there is snow and ice to be found yet in some sheltered situations, and vegetation has hardly begun, or only begun, to start.

I have not been at Meeting today - for there was none to attend.  I went to Sabbath School though, or rather to assist in organizing the Sabbath School for the season, which was fairly accomplished in due form, and with full prospect of interest and good. I think the Sabbath School will be very large in proportion to the whole attendance at Meetings.  There seems a much more hopeful prospect of benefitting the young here than the older, and I am not sure that Ministers might not properly and profitably devote more of their attentions and effort to the children.  I heard one Minister, (Rev Mr. Hayes of Frankfort Me.) say last winter that he had for some years systematically devoted one half of his efforts, both in the pulpit and out, to the juvenile portions of his parish, and his only doubt was whether he should not a still larger portion.  The people here expected to have preaching now all, or about all, of the time; A Free Will Baptist 'Elder\" once a month, a Calvinist Baptist the same, and Congregationalist half the Sabbaths; all in the same house, - or Hall.

I sometimes think that nature must have intended me for a Farmer, and really if I were able to do it as I would like, I might sometime give up other occupations and devote myself to that.  Had I better go out West and make a farm of some beautiful prairie!  You hope that I will not be \"low spirited\". I believe I am not very apt to suffer much in that way.  I never had what people call \"the blues\" and which some really suffer so much from.  I think I rather enjoy the present constitutionally, and instead of looking upon the dark side of the future, am perhaps too much inclined not to think of it at all!

I thing his sermons were about the most elegant I ever heard. The thought was excellent, while the expression was beautiful and polished to the highest degree.

There is a great deal doing in RailRoads in Western New York; a great many new projects. But I am unacquainted there. Nobody knows me.  If I could have been out there for a year or two past so as to be known in almost any capacity. I think I might this Spring have been pretty well situated, perhaps a Chief Engineer on some road. I really have the vanity to believe that there are some not truly better qualified than myself, who are now receiving two or three thousand dollars a year. I spent the Sabbath, June 8th, at Westfield N.Y. with my sister Anne, who I believe I have told you is since Jan. last year a Teacher in Westfield Academy. I enjoyed a day or two in Westfield very much. Westfield is a beautiful place; Mr. Rumsey's where my sister boards is a very pleasant family.  I really felt almost at home at once. Mr Tinker, the Presbyterian Minister at Westfield, formerly I think a Missionary at Sandwich Islands, is an excellent preacher, one of the best.  Monday 9th, was so windy that the Steamboats could not call in at Westfield or Barcelona. So I rode to Erie Penn. by Stage Coach in the night, ad remained there one day.  Then at Cleaveland, Ohio, one day; and at Detroit, Michigan, and today have safely arrived at Chicago Illinois.  One can get about pretty fast nowadays, even and stop a while occasionally.

The great freshet and roads broken up, have prevented his getting here, and we hear this evening that he has taken another route and gone back to Chicago. Thus leaving me in the lurch.\nHowever, I have met here with another gentleman connected with the road, who is pretty fully acquainted with its affairs, and knows where I am most needed. He wishes me to proceed at once to the Southern Division, and I think I will on Monday.  I had preferred to remain somewhere toward the Northern part of the state, thinking that would be more healthy; but it seems their lines are running all back on the high grounds, away from the Marshes, and it may really be the healthiest part of the route.

June 29. 1857\nDear Antoinette\nI believe I must spend a little while this evening in writing to you. I have not been at Church at all today. It has been a very rainy day. The Illinois black mud is very deep. The Church is a long way off, and at the top of a very high bluff.  Therefore being assured by the natives that there would be no meeting I did not undertake to go up. I hear since however that there was a meeting in the A.M.and ten persons present, but this afternoon the minister did not attempt to go.  He is an old school Presbyterian, formerly of Louisville Ky.\nSo I have been in my room all day, reading some, and I must confess, sleeping some.  I was happy to find here in this little Tavern as indeed I have frequently in the West, the Am. Tract Soc. Evan. Fam. Library Series, in which one can always find good reading.\nI have written a letter to my Mother this afternoon, and have been thinking a good deal of way Down East, of Mother, Brothers and Sisters at Milo & Bangor, and of your dear self.\nYou can hardly imagine how anxious I am becoming to hear from you all, or what an age it seems since I have heard.\nOnly to think what a long time it has been, Almost five weeks since I left Bangor, and have not heard from there since, and longer still since I heard from you!\nI believe I wrote to you last from Springfield about a week ago. From Springfield I went to Alton by Stage Coach Oh what a ride across those prairies, sometimes the horizon as unlimited as on the broad ocean, sometimes most beautiful groves of timber; and then the prairie flowers.  But I cannot describe it; and you have seen the Prairies for yourself. I did not stop at Alton. I have had a sort of dislike for Alton and have considered it almost as under a curse, since the death of Lovejoy there.  I went to St. Louis and stopped there one day, and was surprised at its wealth, business & prosperity. From St. Louis I went around to Cairo & to Caledonia on the Ohio River, where I remained one day, and then came around here.

It had been so long since I heard from you; and I was getting very impatient, and anxious. And I have not yet heard from home, Mother, Brother, or Sister. Letters had a little farther to go there you know than to you which would make the answers one or two days later, but I shall now expect them next mail at any rate.\nI am very much obliged to you for writing immediately on the receipt of my letter. A single day when one is waiting is a good while. I should have written the day I received yours, but that there is no mail until Monday.\nAs you may imagine, I have by this time had considerable experience of Life among the Suckers. I have certainly learned a good many new things. We have made a survey 50 miles through Southern Illinois. I can tell you so you can trace our course on the map. If on your maps the Base Lines & Meridians of the N.I. Government Land Surveys are laid down, it is easily traced. We commenced where the \"Third Principal Meridian\", {which is nearly the Meridian of Cairo & Vandalia} crosses Big Muddy River in Jackson County, and run Northerly through Jackson Perry & Washington Counties to the \"Base Line\" which is thirty of forty miles south of Vandalia. The whole distance, eastern people would think almost uninhabited; they call it here pretty well settled, which means simply that there is an occasional Farm, say from one to twelve miles apart I think that in the fifty miles we did pass within ten miles","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102226,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102226","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/f7c3f837ae9544c4e58ccafc4ca331c2.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/f7c3f837ae9544c4e58ccafc4ca331c2.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/f7c3f837ae9544c4e58ccafc4ca331c2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f7c3f837ae9544c4e58ccafc4ca331c2.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:30:39+00:00","modified":"2020-09-13T15:39:48+00:00","filename":"f7c3f837ae9544c4e58ccafc4ca331c2.jpg","authentication":"04299bba7ceca61b3162ba1f819979ce","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_174_011_002_o2.jpg","size":1458608,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2750,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04911138047138},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225953"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225953"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["225953"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f7c3f837ae9544c4e58ccafc4ca331c2.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806179,"FileSize":1458608,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2750\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2750,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:27:41","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 22:59:53","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 22:59:53","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2925,"ExifImageLength":3829,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"of any village containing 100 inhabitants, no not 20 inhabitants, I think. I wrote to you some descriptions of our first stopping place. We found such all the way through, some perhaps a little better, and some worse.  I should have preferred taking a tent with our wagon, and making ourselves as comfortable as we could with our own shelter, but the arrangements were made before I came, partly from the impossibility of finding water except at the houses.  So we boarded everywhere at the Farmer's houses.  On one account I liked the arrangement. It gave greater facilities for getting acquainted with the people, mode of life etc etc. I suppose the people here are quite different from there in the Northern part of Illinois. Here they are mostly from the South, some few from Ohio & Pennsylvania.  About all came here very poor. This is however one of the most fertile regions in the world; almost every kind of crop, cotton, rice, & tobacco, as well as wheat, corn & oats, grown here with very little labor. The people are the most indolent I ever saw and yet every one has big fields of corn and great herds of Cattle and hogs.  They all eat Cornbread & bacon, and drink sour milk and lots of coffee.  They seem to want nothing more, only some sort of log hovel for shelter; or if they ever think of more, are too lazy to work for it.  Still they have many good qualities, are kindhearted hospitable, and if they would take as much pains or exert themselves to better themselves as they will to accommodate or oblige another, they might soon be comfortably off.  A real \"Yankee\" is quite a curiosity to most of these people, and they stare well at first to see a man eat who will drink neither coffee or sour milk. \"As well as\" I can judge however they generally soon form a pretty good opinion of a \"Yankee.\"!

As for drinking vessels there is a great variety as you mention: perhaps the most common however is a gourd shell hollowed out!  Every thing however, it is easily seen, is very rapidly improving throughout this country: new settlers coming in, and the old trying trying far more than ever to improve.  The Country itself is beautiful, beautiful exceedingly. The climate, at this season, seems occasionally rather warm to a New Englander. The People here though complain more of the cold than the heat. One rarely suffers from the heat in the prairie, as there is usually a fine cooling breeze; but where the sun shines in the timber, sheltered from the winds it is hot indeed. And in the prairie if one sits or lies down among the thick grass, the ground is so dry and the sunshine so hot, it seems like a heated oven at once; while standing up, or better sitting on a horse it is very comfortable. The warmest place I have seen is in running a line through the great cornfields, where the corn is eight or ten feet high, as it grows here, and pretty effectually keeps off the air. We completed out Survey No. One a week ago,and came here to make up plans, profiles, and calculations for one week.

I must tell you another thing. You know I came here without promising to stay.  The agreement was simply that I should come out and go to work, and receive $2.50 per diem while I staid. Upon settlement at the end of July I am allowed $3.00 per diem for the whole time. Moreover I find myself set down from August 1st, for $3.50 per diem.  So I begin to think that I can do well out here, if I find that the climate agrees well with me. I find that Southern Illinois has been considered very unhealthy for Eastern men. Part of the time I have thought it was for me.  One while I thought I should certainly leave at the end of July. The water I suppose affected me very much at first; I had quite a Diarrhea or Dysentery rather, which, made me very weak: and in the so very hot languid weather I could not recover strength at all.  Why for a week or two I really seemed incapable of as much  active effort, mental or physical, in a day, as usually in an hour or two. Any effort, under the scorching sun wilted me at once, and fatigued and lamed me for a long time. But within two or three weeks showers have sprung up an cooled the air and the ground. the breezes seem fresher, the atmosphere purer, the earth less parched; and my health and strength seem very well restored. The old settlers say my acclimation is very favorable; I have no doubt that it is much more so than if I had followed the almost universal prescription to put brandy always with my water, and plenty of coffee with my bacon, as too many even of Eastern men do in coming here. I am very glad indeed that you like Illinois: for if I conclude to try and stay out here, I shall very soon be wanting you to come out here with me. I shall not be contented to stay here long alone I can assure you. My love and regard to Father & Mother, brother & sister -  to Mrs Wm. Raymond, if you see her & please. I liked Mrs Raymond best of all my acquaintances in N.H. after Antoinette. I shall be waiting most earnestly to hear from you again soon as possible. Sincerely yours I. S.

Illinois\nSabbath Morning Sept 14, 1851\nDear Antoinette, Your kind letter I received and eagerly read upon my arrival here last night somewhat late. I have just been reading it again this morning.  How long seems the time it take letters to go from here to New England & back. I seem to realise more and more every week how very far away I have placed myself.  I believe the mails arrive here securely, but by no means regularly.  Since I have been here I have received one letter from Bangor one week, and the next one mailed at the same office two weeks earlier than the one first received.  I had begun to get quite impatient and anxious before I got your letter. I should have written again before receiving yours but, thinking of it almost every day, I kept expecting that the next day I should get your letter.  Another trouble here is that I do not always get letters as soon as they arrive here. I am now moving about considerable, and sometimes am not here for nearly a whole month, and when I am away twenty or thirty miles, I find I do well if I her from the Post Office as often as once a week.  The letters I found here last night had been awaiting me here for three or four days.  I believe though that letters are almost doubly prised when I do get them.  As you and other friends caution me a good deal about my health, I must have my turn in hoping you will be careful and not over fatigue yourself in Domestic duties and get sick.  I presume you are an accomplished housekeeper and certainly wish I could add one to the number of your visitors and enjoy your hospitality for a day or two at least.  I wish I could be there today and enjoy a good New England Sabbath.  It is a great privation to be so destitute of Sanctuary privileges as one must be here.

There are many professors of religion here, perhaps nearly as large a part of the population as in New England.  They are mostly Methodists and various sorts of Baptists, but mostly very ignorant; Quite a large part of the old settlers here cannot read or write; and many of them, judging by their conduct & habits, we should think hardly half Christianised.  The customs of the country are so different, and the mode of life and the necessities of the case so strange, that they must be looked upon with much clarity.  Here at Mr Root's place, which is my home here, there is a regular Episcopal Service every Sabbath, Mr Root being what they call a \"Lay Reader.\" I can enjoy his service & sermon pretty well in lack of any better suited to my taste.   Since I wrote before I have had various Sabbath experience. The first Sabbath in Aug. I believe I wrote you.  I was here. The second, I was down in Jackson Co. and went seven miles to Vergennes, where is a Presbyterian Church, but found the minister sick and no preaching.  There was however a Prayer Class Meeting, which I attended.  I had never been at one before. I rather liked it. Did you ever attend one?  It seems to me the institution rightly managed may be a beneficial one in many cases.  I judge it might have all the good there could be in a Roman Catholic Confessional, and some more.  On the whole, I enjoyed the Sabbath much, though there was a violent shower in the Afternoon, and I was obliged to ride back through woods & Prairies without road in the very dark night. However, being an Engineer I found the way without difficulty.  The next Sabbath, Aug. 17, the day you were writing to me, I was at the Presbyterian Church in Du Quion in this county. The 24th I was at this place.

I was not really much sick, thought I could be out every day, but they say here that exposure to the hot sun is the very worst thing, and would soon make me very sick, My symptoms were only pain in my head & neck, and alternate days a few hours of fever heat & thirst. I thought it best to be careful in Season, and so found Comfortable Quarters with Dr Lucas, Blissville, Grand Prairie, Jefferson Co. and \"took it easy.\" In all week 8 or 9 days before last, I went out but two days and then did little or nothing. In Dr H.B. Lucas I found a really kind friend. Last week I was out about all week, doing hardly any thing, however, but ride about, with an umbrella over my head. It has been very unusually warm weather for two or three weeks past, and I find it does not do at all to expose myself to the Sunshine now. If I do not feel a good deal better tomorrow I rather think I shall not go out any more at present, but confine myself to work in the office until my health & strength are fully restored. If I do so I shall probably go down to Jonesboro 30 or 40 miles south of this where I can have much better Office Conveniences than here. I have plenty to do in office but dislike to go now, as I suppose my presence in Field would be worth perhaps $\"100.00 per week to the R.R. interests for a few weeks longer.

Illinois\nSabbath, Oct. 19. 1851\nDear Antoinette\nI received last evening your letter of Sept. 23.  Has it is not been a long time in reaching me? It arrived at the Mount Hawkins Post Office however more than a week since.  The mails are very slow and very irregular here.\nIt seems that we both thought alike and at once about writing without for an answer.  I sent a letter to Dunbarton about a week ago, having become entirely tired of waiting for the slow coming around of the mails.  Still it is perhaps uncertain which you will receive first, this or that.\nI am very sorry to hear of your Mother's sickness, but hope she has ere this fully recovered her health.

How long the time seems it takes a letter to pass from New Hampshire here.  Several times I have written lately but none of them received when you wrote.  The letter you are replying to in the one just received was written long ago, when I was away up in the Prairies.  The time seems longer lately.  There has been so much doing here, and so many changes within three or four weeks past.  I have just come in town this fore noon, having been away since Monday, and must write in haste, as I have to leave here again in a few hours; for Rock River where my party are locating some fifteen miles from here.\nI am very glad to learn by your letter that your Mother's health is so much improving. I presume you are very happy there this beautiful autumnal weather.  How I wish I could visit you a few days.

Thanksgiving is not at all observed here; in fact no one seemed to remember the day; and it is a day when, you know, a New Englander especially thinks of home and its surroundings, of relatives and friends, and more than ever longs to be with them.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102268,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102268","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/11d036720724c71e58c24445d16de7a7.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/11d036720724c71e58c24445d16de7a7.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/11d036720724c71e58c24445d16de7a7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/11d036720724c71e58c24445d16de7a7.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:31:13+00:00","modified":"2020-09-11T15:40:58+00:00","filename":"11d036720724c71e58c24445d16de7a7.jpg","authentication":"916eeb2b48078bf78ceac07fc3f1e28f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_174_016_002_o2.jpg","size":1950950,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2811,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.06426308022715},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230319"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230319"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230319"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"11d036720724c71e58c24445d16de7a7.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806180,"FileSize":1950950,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2811\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2811,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:28:28","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:03:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:03:19","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3069,"ExifImageLength":3930,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I am extremely glad to hear that you Father & Mother had\nso completely recovered their health, and hope it will continue.\nYou write in sight of the snow covered ground, sparkling\nand white.

Ill.\nNov. 24, 1851\nJonesboro, Union Co. Illinois.\nThursday, Nov. 20, 1851\nDear Antoinette\nYour letter of Oct. 28, was joyfully received two days since.  I intended to write that day, but press of business prevented.  Col. Mason had just arrived here, had very short time to stay, and I had considerable business to attend to and settle up.  I have now been relieved of my temporary charge of the Division Engineership, after retaining its honor and dignity -- or rather care and responsibility -- longer than I expected, on account of Col. Mason delaying his return.\nThe new incumbent, L. W. Ashley has also arrived, so that I am again one under authority, though still have power, like the centurion, to say to one, \"go\" and he goeth, and to another 'do this' and he doeth it.

Ill.\nDec. 10 1851\nJonesboro Union Co. Illinois\nTuesday, Dec. 9, 1851\nDear Antoinette\nYour kind letter of Nov. 22, is just received.  I am going tomorrow morning to Cairo and that region for a week or ten days.  So I will write a bit tonight, though I have little time, as it is already rather late in the evening.\nYour hopes that the winter here may be one of health appear likely to be realized.  It is apparently quite healthy now every where here.  The miserable sallow wretched ague stricken countenances of the natives {as they seemed six or eight weeks ago} are getting to be quite tolerably healthy looking, more like those of comfortable human beings.  My own health I believe is getting quite firmly established, and I really enjoy the kind of weather we have here lately very much -- cool, bracing, frosty.

Ill.\nJan 16  1852\nJonesboro, Union Co. Illinois\nWednesday Jan 14. 1852\nDear Antoinette\nYour kind letter of Dec. 19, I received on my arrival in Town last night. It had been here two or three days I suppose. I have been away for a week, up in the Prairies, at Mt Hawkins my last summer's home, and out to Murphysboro, Pinkneyville, and Nashville, the County - Shire Towns, to obtain certain land records from the County offices. I have got so that I enjoy riding horseback very much, even in the cold weather. The past week has been quite cold and stormy, unusually so for this Country, more snow has fallen than often in whole winters, and all the Suckers are very much curled up by the cold. But I have enjoyed it very much, it has seemed almost like New England weather, though the Cold weather here would be warm for winter weather there.\nI have not been up at Mt Hawkins since I left there last September, and the visit was quite pleasant. Mrs Roots called me rather a bad boy for not coming to see my \"Mother\" oftener. I believe she was as kind to me when sick as a Mother could be. The prairies I find look rather dreary in winter, especially when a cold wintry wind is blowing the snow across them. Even the quails and prairie chickens hardly seem to enjoy it.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102292,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102292","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7f6bd4d938f5363d6137b2834412eb91.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7f6bd4d938f5363d6137b2834412eb91.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7f6bd4d938f5363d6137b2834412eb91.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7f6bd4d938f5363d6137b2834412eb91.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:31:32+00:00","modified":"2020-09-16T21:28:45+00:00","filename":"7f6bd4d938f5363d6137b2834412eb91.jpg","authentication":"62e380d6a9a677617ccb3dddd0c10b7f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_175_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1898940,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2835,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.062020380168528},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230450"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230450"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230450"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7f6bd4d938f5363d6137b2834412eb91.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806181,"FileSize":1898940,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2835\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2835,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:28:57","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:04:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:04:50","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3087,"ExifImageLength":3920,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I am much obliged for your copy of Rail Road News.

The Winter has been very unusually sever, and all Travelling very much interrupted. The past week or two though has been very warm, almost as warm as summer it has seemed to me. The frost & snow went off in a hurry the rivers are all free from ice, and the navigation uninterrupted, So we may now expect regular Mails. Your last letters have been very long on the road; this last almost a whole month. Probably mine have been equally delayed. If so I fear you may have been rather impatient in waiting for them.\n\nI wrote to you last from Marseilles, a week ago, I believe. Since then I have once almost made up my mind to start for the East at once, though the journey would be rather unpleasant at this season, with considerable staging, and some risk of detention. I am getting to be very much troubled as, we do not get get any orders as to what is to be done here this season - only that we must be 'All ready'. We may, on the one hand, be called upon any day to put the work under control at once, and make us all busy; or on the other hand the orders may be as","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102309,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102309","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/e16fbd5630c3bc5cb073b207e7706309.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/e16fbd5630c3bc5cb073b207e7706309.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/e16fbd5630c3bc5cb073b207e7706309.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e16fbd5630c3bc5cb073b207e7706309.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:31:44+00:00","modified":"2020-09-18T18:48:10+00:00","filename":"e16fbd5630c3bc5cb073b207e7706309.jpg","authentication":"a8ad612e829b066307c68cfac9be48be","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_175_003_002_o2.jpg","size":1725826,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2845,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.056168261407277},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230547"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230547"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230547"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e16fbd5630c3bc5cb073b207e7706309.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806182,"FileSize":1725826,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2845\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2845,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:29:15","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:05:47","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:05:47","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3109,"ExifImageLength":3933,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"suddenly to discharge all subordinates, and shut up shop for time.

I believe I wrote you that there was a Presbyterian Minister here now, and a very good one too Rev. Mr. Stewart lately of Grenville Bond Co. Ill. The field of his labor however is I believe all Southern Illinois almost, and he does not seem to preach here very often. I have not seen him now for some time, as I have been out of Town so much.\nNext Saturday & Sabbath the Methodist Quarterly Meeting is to be held there. And I intend to be present of possible.

And one of an earlier date Jan. 23d came to hand two or three days before, and is still unreplied to. I last wrote to you I think two weeks ago today.\n\nYou suppose Early Spring comes earlier in Southern Illinois than it does among the Granite Mountains of New Hampshire. I think it does. At any rate the weather here since the last week of January has been that of Spring, as warm mostly as New England May at least. The ground looks very green already in many places, especially the Wheat fields. The buds are swelling rapidly, and some of the earlier forest trees & shrubs have already \"hung all their lapels forth\" Yet there is very likely more cold and frost, perhaps more snow even, before the first of April. Though there has been any frost but two or three times only since the last week of Jan.\nI have been in much trouble for some time, as to when I shall, or can, go East. I did think to start by about this time, but it seems I can not get away all any rate until we after we can learn the decision of the R.R. Company, as to what is to be done here this Season and how it is to be done","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102317,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102317","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7857fe183f276e90afb0f7c8de6964c6.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7857fe183f276e90afb0f7c8de6964c6.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7857fe183f276e90afb0f7c8de6964c6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7857fe183f276e90afb0f7c8de6964c6.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:31:51+00:00","modified":"2020-09-18T20:43:49+00:00","filename":"7857fe183f276e90afb0f7c8de6964c6.jpg","authentication":"4e9ecf0d2b53fa72ff8712dd920d4cf9","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_175_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1836233,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2867,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.059302955728662},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230610"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230610"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230610"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7857fe183f276e90afb0f7c8de6964c6.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806182,"FileSize":1836233,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2867\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2867,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:29:25","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:06:10","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:06:10","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3121,"ExifImageLength":3918,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"And we do not as yet receive any direction, though long since expected, except simply \"Be in readiness} Of course, it does not do for me to leave upon any pretext.

If I were at leisure I travel five hundred miles, & give fifty dollars, just to see the man. I do regard him as not only the greatest Orator, but the greatest man now living in the world. Is he not the greatest spirit of the age? And if his life is spared, destined to the greatest influence over the age & world?  If so, what a blessing that he is such a man; so different from many Master Spirits of other ages, for instance. Napoleon Bonaparte, whose influence was so great in the beginning of this century.\n\n You are very right in surmising that I am proud of My State. Has not Maine done nobly? May others soon follow its example. Every letter I get from there contains something about the success and beneficial working of the Liquor Law, or as it is called \"The Maine Law.\" \n\nI am very much hoping that Old Massachusetts will pass a similar law this Winter.

but I believe all decidedly ill looking and disorderly.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102325,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102325","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/eba10bb525b54f144ba6ac19406d04dd.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/eba10bb525b54f144ba6ac19406d04dd.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/eba10bb525b54f144ba6ac19406d04dd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/eba10bb525b54f144ba6ac19406d04dd.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:31:57+00:00","modified":"2020-09-18T21:52:00+00:00","filename":"eba10bb525b54f144ba6ac19406d04dd.jpg","authentication":"2fab5d9f25e8abf6bb950ff08926ddbb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_175_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1714223,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2871,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.055285389011443},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230636"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230636"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230636"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"eba10bb525b54f144ba6ac19406d04dd.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806182,"FileSize":1714223,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2871\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2871,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:29:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:06:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:06:36","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3085,"ExifImageLength":3867,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"your good letter of Feb. 27 came safely to hand last evening and a little one of Feb. 21, a day or two before;

Mr. Cutler, John Cutler, with whom I lived, an hereditary friend of our family, from Royalston Mass. and a noble specimen of a man, was a Methodist, a real old fashioned Wesleyan Methodist. Exeter was a great stronghold of the Methodists. Their preachers there, I remember with admiration. They were Mighty Men, men of strong frames and strong minds, with great warm hearts, bold and full of zeal. I certainly came very near being a Methodist. Le me do the Methodists Justice. I did not perceive there among them, not have I elsewhere or since, perceived among them as I certainly think I have among Baptists an unworthy spirit of proselytism {if it is a proper word} from other denominations. Their proselyting is from the ranks of sin & sinners, from the camps of the enemy not from those of their Allies. That, would at that time I believe have most effectually turned me from them. I remember, when, my Congregational friends I suppose thinking I was about to become a Methodist, a certain Cong. Minister took me in hand in a proselyting spirit to argue certain doctrines etc. I know he almost made me a Methodist at once!\nI became a Congregationalist I believe simply and solely upon the question of Church Government. I should perhaps as readily have become a Methodist as even a Presbyterian. I certainly did not then, perhaps do hardly still, though my Metaphysical perceptions on those points have been very much strengthened & enforced, & my own opinions","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102329,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102329","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/2d3352b3ad9fa8fbf5e49ba909565b31.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/2d3352b3ad9fa8fbf5e49ba909565b31.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/2d3352b3ad9fa8fbf5e49ba909565b31.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2d3352b3ad9fa8fbf5e49ba909565b31.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:32:00+00:00","modified":"2020-09-19T01:54:44+00:00","filename":"2d3352b3ad9fa8fbf5e49ba909565b31.jpg","authentication":"e0f44a8dbc9b29a381a0a2430fefce77","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_175_005_004_o2.jpg","size":1676406,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2892,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053673159674197},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230647"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230647"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["230647"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"2d3352b3ad9fa8fbf5e49ba909565b31.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806182,"FileSize":1676406,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2892\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2892,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:29:37","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:06:47","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:06:47","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":89,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3107,"ExifImageLength":3867,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"very much confirmed, since then, by many, almost night long discussions & disquistions with a certain Methodist College friend & sometime Chum of mine (Such arguments you know almost always have a powerful effect in confirming & strengthening one's own views and tenets upon any subject) I did not then, do hardly yet perceive the necessary vital, essential, difference in the creed of these denominations.

I have usually but very little time to spare from business upon other days. Especially as I finish entirely upon week days many kinds of business that other Engineers habitually perform on the Sabbath. Then there is no such thing in this country as a Afternoon Meeting. Services are universally at 11 A.M. and in the evening. So the Afternoon is spent by all classes, members of the Churches as well as others in walking or riding about, visiting etc. Even the Clergymen do the same, at any rate,  keep open house on Sabbath Afternoon, and invite any one to call at that time specially. My New England habits & feelings prejudices they would be called here, do not exactly permit this though I am probably entirely alone in the whole region in uniformly refusing all invitations to walk, ride, or visit on the Sabbath.

A letter received yesterday relieve my mind very much. He had gone to Dr. Munde's Water Cure Establishment at NorthHampton, had got better, and was about returning to Bangor.  I was the more alarmed about it as his disease was occasioned by an injury something like that which produced dear Joseph's disease. I perhaps wrote to you about his getting hurt last winter a year ago. I suppose it likely that he saved the lives of a couple of girls by throwing himself against a runaway horse which tried to jump over the sleigh in which he and the girls were riding. The force of the blow was so great as to crush into fragments the sleigh even though the horse himself did not touch it at all, being fairly crowded aside by my brother's shoulders. His back was hurt however, and has been lame ever since until a few weeks ago he was attacked with violent pain in the back & acute inflamation of the kidneys, occasioned the doctors say by the same injury a year since.

The one who preached this evening, A Tailor from Nottingham England, a Local preacher at Marion in this State I liked pretty well. Plainly without advantages of early education, he is evidently a student, probably a hard student, and being young, I consider really promising.

It was longer in the way than usual some letters have been only about 10 days on the road. For a week or two past the Mails have been very irregular, and in all last week We had but one Eastern Mail I think. \nYou write of having another winter in March. It has been about so here. Warm weather came on the last of January. February I think was warmer than I ever knew April at the East: it seemed most like May. Vegetation seemed to starting very rapidly. But about the first of March winter seemed to come again about a winter fit for this climate. Cold, win, rain, and frost. Vegetation seemed to stop and stand still almost for six weeks. Some early leaves which had been coming out fell off and others have been from then until now in getting fairly out; so with the blossoms of the fruit trees etc. etc.\n\nIt has seemed very strange. I suppose vegetation always starts very slowly here compared with the North where every plant and tree seems to realize that its season is short. Some Spring flowers which are common to both climates, and which at the North are in blossom  as soon as the snow is fairly off are here hardly out now where there has been no snow for almost three months. I suppose the plants have just such a time to perfect themselves, forming their roots etc. and come out at about the same time of year in all climates.\n\n I am glad to hear that your Reading Circle prospers so well.

They have got their eyes fully open to the giant wrongs and almost unnumbered abuses of their present systems, both civil and religious, and are very liable in their enthusiasm to endeavor to tear down every timeworn institution and rusty bulwark which they fancy in the way of their proposed developement.

What they call among the Baptists in this Country \"Regulars\" or \"Ironsides\", are noted by their \"Forkish\"? belief in the question of Election, and their most bitter opposition to Temperance and every species of Missionary Effort or Reform.

The Eastern Newspapers for one week we have failed entirely of receiving. Last Sunday night and Monday Morning was the greatest storm I ever saw. I believe there is never any thing like it in New England. It was really almost dreadfully magnificent. There seemed to be one continual rolling peal of thunder, and one constant uninterrupted flash of lightning, and such torrents of rain!  There was considerable damage done, as once before this spring, by the washing away of fences, destruction of roads, bridges and crops. In some places considerable injury was done to cattle and crops by hail. A few miles from here one man was drowned in trying to ford a bit of brook near his house. This Afternoon is has rained about in the same way though without the thunder and lightning.

When this Messenger left it was thought that John would not live.\n\nI shall probably remain with Col.

Niagara Falls. June 1, 1854\nBangor Mane June 6, 1854\n\n                                                                                                Niagara Fall's June 1st  '54\n\nMy Dearest Ettie\n\n  I mailed a letter to you yesterday from New York City. But, as I have a little leisure believe I will write again this afternoon. I seem to have luck for travelling o'nights. I could not get ready to leave New York in time for Morning trains yesterday as they leave early, and I must be there somewhat in business hours. So I finished my business in forenoon; & P.M. went up to Crystal Palace. But it was only an aggravation, as it were. One seems to want weekdays if not weeks, instead of hours; and the paltry hour or so I could spend was hardly time enough to walk round it all. I ought at any rate to spend a day or two in the Machinery department. I left N.Y. City at 6 P.M. yesterday 31st Ult. riding all night, frosty night it was too through New York. There was no fire in the cars, & I almost needed my cloak.

But I am afraid she has one very bad fault - you may have heard me speak of the same in somebody else - caring for other people more than for ones' self. Now isn't this a sin? To be sure Moralists etc. make out high authority for it, but I suppose it is by some perversion of scripture - a natural one, and in most cases liable to do little hurt. Mankind generally being too supremely selfish to be affected thereby.

But the Thermometer shows 92 F here now at 9 A.M. I tell you it is warm. One feels it the more after the hot nights. The languid heat of the day. I think since the 25th June the Thermometer has not been below 80 F (if as low, at any time day or night. I was very wet and cold here till near the Middle 10th of June; since that there has been hardly a shower, hot weather all the tie. The ground is baked as dry & hard & burns the feet like a hot brick. One can hardly walk without thick soles. The dust in the roads - well I won't try. I moved up here last Tuesday. I have got the Office in corner of Freighthouse, 10 ' high 12' sq. finished off, lathed & plastered, window & doors. There I have established my safe, desk, tables and a big new book case. Over head I have set up my little camp cot bed, with every necessary convenience; For my meals I go over to our boarding house kept very tolerably by E.N. Smith, and inhabited by various Smiths, Skinners, and Carpenters, of whom Charles W.R. being Chief has the best, a very comfortable room which however he shares with S.

Yours of May 31st arrived here June 10th two weeks ago yesterday: but awful ---there was none for two weeks. Yours of June7, did not arrive until yesterday 24th and then with it, the one of June 13th and also one from Mother. So I had quite a feast.  Oh Ettie I love you for every letter you write to me. I am glad you like \"Euthanasia\". Of course you get other copies of that & Bryant, if you like, to give to any one; and I would do so. There is a great pleasure in giving as well as receiving good gifts (greatest in giving where they will be prized) and I would not dent myself the pleasure. You surely ought to make some good presents to Lucy & Maria, Let them be good ones. Valuable - costing something, and at the same time good otherwise. Remember that you have money enough - if not in your purse - in Eliab's. He has money of mine, and will honor your drafts.\nI thank you for proposing the reading to chapters of French Testament every Sabbath. I have hunted up the French testament from the bottom of Trunk & and read this morning the 7 & 8 chapters of John which is the lesson for today I believe. We will try to keep up the practice.\n Do not worry about my health. It is very good. I am better & stronger than last summer; and feel the heat less. The trip east did me good. I feel better for it every way: the change & the relaxation were beneficious.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102425,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102425","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/100cf9581bfd34e9a882454c0cb7f883.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/100cf9581bfd34e9a882454c0cb7f883.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/100cf9581bfd34e9a882454c0cb7f883.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/100cf9581bfd34e9a882454c0cb7f883.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:33:17+00:00","modified":"2020-09-22T02:30:39+00:00","filename":"100cf9581bfd34e9a882454c0cb7f883.jpg","authentication":"efc6f87d698a40455d88a29018d4d1d5","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_176_008_002_o2.jpg","size":1738582,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2756,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05841067300973},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231250"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231250"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231250"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"100cf9581bfd34e9a882454c0cb7f883.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806185,"FileSize":1738582,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2756\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2756,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:31:39","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:12:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:12:50","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3249,"ExifImageLength":4243,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I have been very busy since I got back here; every thing behind hand you know, and many things to look after.

I get quite tired of reading, as it was hot, and the air very close.\nRefused very many invitations to dinner, stopping only at Dr. Wall's to Enquire after Mr. Noel who is there sick, as also Mr. Aspen, we returned here. Mr. Noel was taken a week or more since with Billious Fever I expect.\nSent for Dr. Wall who presented 40 grains of Calomel, Noel said 60 grains would have cured him, but the Dr. would give only 40 & so he sick, and worse salivated. Noel you know is hard headed; has years ago in habit of drinking his quart of Brandy per diem; and it takes a great doze of medicine to effect him. J.C. Smith & J. N. Mitchell started for the East Friday or Saturday. to be gone a month.\nI told you I got yesterday a letter from Dunbarton. Father & Mother. I would write a special answer to it; but perhaps it is needless, as I shall direct this letter to you there; as I presume you will reach there by the time this does.\nFather wants to know about my plans. You can tell him all about it as well as I can I guess. I believe there is nothing next. I have already explained to you how our lack of Ton & delay here on the Track is like to keep me closely confined here all the Summer","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102437,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102437","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d188179dc8204ab2ccbaec7b174098d2.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d188179dc8204ab2ccbaec7b174098d2.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d188179dc8204ab2ccbaec7b174098d2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d188179dc8204ab2ccbaec7b174098d2.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:33:26+00:00","modified":"2020-09-22T03:35:20+00:00","filename":"d188179dc8204ab2ccbaec7b174098d2.jpg","authentication":"b18b1f72ff58debadda64d67711cdfc2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_176_009_004_o2.jpg","size":1703862,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2790,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.056546594982079},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231325"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231325"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231325"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d188179dc8204ab2ccbaec7b174098d2.jpg","FileDateTime":1595806185,"FileSize":1703862,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2790\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2790,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:31:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:13:25","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:13:25","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":34,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3286,"ExifImageLength":4239,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1278,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1278","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Summer & fall I cannot probably get away at all, till I get through here; and can tell noting yet when that will be, Suppose I could not get away next fall; and you & George could come out to me to a comfortable home at Centralia!

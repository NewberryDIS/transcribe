To deprive themselves of the generative organs is a great sin. Repent of this evil among you. Some women come into the world barren. In order therefore for her to fill the position which was designed for her, she must adopt a child and love it as though her own. One doing this, shall see the Great Spirit. Also she may adopt orphans, and bring them up in virtuous principles. This also is good in the mind of the Great Spirit. If you tie up the clothes of an orphan child, the Great Spirit will notice it + reward you for it. Universal benevolence is good. The Great Spirit designed that when a man and woman should marry, they should love one another. It is wrong therefore to use \"Gnoh ate.\" (This probably corresponds with what is termed by the English coquettry - The Indians say this substance has such a charming power, that the person under its influence cannot separate himself from the charmer. It cannot safely safely be termed love, for sometimes the parties hate one another to such a degree as to be forced to come to blows, + yet the person charmed cares nothing about it.) This practice he says is ruinous?, repent and use it no more. It is the will of the Great Spirit that husband and wife shall love one another -- If they are blessed with Children, when they become of a proper age they must be married to an old experienced person. If they in turn be blessed with a child, let them unite in offering their thanks to the Great Spirit, When they have grand children they must be more thankful, for they cannot make their gratitude too manifest. It is not right when a young woman becomes pregnant, to circulate false stories concerning her and her husband,  for in doing, it may cause a separation. This is a great sin in the mind of the Great Spirit -- Should a man leave two ? such circumstances, a great punishment awaits him In this thing the old people did right. But the Great Spirit wished to renew old things. Parents, teach your children virtuous principles, You all know how great trouble it was to bring up your children, therefore teach them to walk in the paths of virtue. Children, obey your parents -- If you do not willingly submit to the will + requirements of your parents, you will cause them to feel bad + cause them to shed many tears. Disobedient Children are sent to hell. It is the will of the Great Spirit, that those children, who disobey their parents, should repent? and disobey them no more. It is wrong for a father or mother in Law to vex a son or daughter in Law.

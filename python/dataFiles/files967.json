In the morning, I thought on the future, I expected not to behold the dusk of evening. I was more faithful, therefore in the discharge of my daily duties. But Evening came, and I saw--struck out through the opening in the roof of my cabin I saw the stars which the Great Spirit had made to serve as ornaments in the heavens. Again I returned my grateful thanks to my Creator, and again resigned myself to Him, expecting not to behold the lights of another morning. In this manner his sickness was prolonged. At one time, however, very early in the morning he says he told his daughter to inform his friends and relatives to come and see him once more, as the sensations in him, predicted that something extraordinary was to befall him.  But when the friends convened, he was dead. A small spot directly over the heart was discovered to be warm. At 9 o'clock he opened his eyes, + was asked if he saw aught.

To deprive themselves of the generative organs is a great sin. Repent of this evil among you. Some women come into the world barren. In order therefore for her to fill the position which was designed for her, she must adopt a child and love it as though her own. One doing this, shall see the Great Spirit. Also she may adopt orphans, and bring them up in virtuous principles. This also is good in the mind of the Great Spirit. If you tie up the clothes of an orphan child, the Great Spirit will notice it + reward you for it. Universal benevolence is good.

It is wrong therefore to use \"Gnoh ate.\" (This probably corresponds with what is termed by the English coquettry - The Indians say this substance has such a charming power, that the person under its influence cannot separate himself from the charmer. It cannot safely safely be termed love, for sometimes the parties hate one another to such a degree as to be forced to come to blows, + yet the person charmed cares nothing about it.) This practice he says is ruinous?, repent and use it no more. It is the will of the Great Spirit that husband and wife shall love one another -- If they are blessed with Children, when they become of a proper age they must be married to an old experienced person. If they in turn be blessed with a child, let them unite in offering their thanks to the Great Spirit, When they have grand children they must be more thankful, for they cannot make their gratitude too manifest. It is not right when a young woman becomes pregnant, to circulate false stories concerning her and her husband,  for in doing, it may cause a separation. This is a great sin in the mind of the Great Spirit -- Should a man leave two ? such circumstances, a great punishment awaits him In this thing the old people did right. But the Great Spirit wished to renew old things. Parents, teach your children virtuous principles, You all know how great trouble it was to bring up your children, therefore teach them to walk in the paths of virtue. Children, obey your parents -- If you do not willingly submit to the will + requirements of your parents, you will cause them to feel bad + cause them to shed many tears. Disobedient Children are sent to hell. It is the will of the Great Spirit, that those children, who disobey their parents, should repent? and disobey them no more. It is wrong for a father or mother in Law to vex a son or daughter in Law.

The next incident witnessed by the Prophet, was the calling together of a husband & wife, who, when on earth were in the habit of continually disputing with one another.

But if a person was good, the contrary would follow. That is they would follow the strait path. The strait path says J. Johnson, was no much travelled, while the other was completely trodden, so that, he says, no grass could grow in the path. He says sometimes happen that the judges have great difficulty in determining which road to direct the person. For sometimes the good & bad actions of a person are so nearly balanced that it requires some time to determine which outweighs. When persons are sent to hell, they sometimes stay there one day & some for a longer time (that is one year) & alone for their sins, then passing onto heaven. But those guilty of the unpardonable sins would never pass from hell to heaven, but should be tormented in hell forever & ever. The Prophet was then commanded to look upon the earth. He looked & behold, there was as great meeting of men, women children. The first object which attracted his attention was a naked man, running through the midst of the people. Behind him followed an unclear number of women. They followed him because he like themselves loved fire water very much. Next came two naked women, seemingly young. Their fault was inconstancy there fore they were punished, by being exposed naked to the meeting. He saw also a woman rolling in dust & ashes. This woman also was punished for being, what is commonly called a stingy? woman. He also saw a man running through the crowd with a large piece of meat in his hand. This was a benevolent man, willing to give to all whom chance might throw in his way The great spirit designed that all men should like him be benevolent.\nAgain the Prophet was commanded to look towards the east. He looked & saw the smoke of a thousand distilleries rising and shutting out the light of the Sun. Again the angels told the Prophet saying, When the Great Spirit becomes tired of the existence of the earth, he will burn it. The first earth he destroyed by water, but the second he will burn with fire. This he will do on account fo the wickedness of earth's inhabitants. The Great Spirit made all good things. He made the winds & the clouds, heat & cold. But the devil made the witches, subject unclear to the will of the Great Spirit. At one time He attempted to kill them, but they fled into the earth. When the end fo the world approaches, the witches will come out of the earth for the purpose of tormenting wicked people.

For his holy Prophet Ganyodiyoh, the Great Spirit himself raised aids.

So for instance the grand religious dance, which is performed at all the feats of the Indians, that also will be danced in heaven, & the Indians say that the Great Spirit himself will be teh singer. The Angels commanded the Prophet to request the Indians to convene in council upon the Tonawanda Indian Reservation. He received an assurance from the angels, that the Indians would convent. The council convened. Then the Indians began to make confessions & to unclear before the Prophet. The Indians from Genesis also did the same. After they had all finished, some of the Indians from the east wish the Prophet to tell whether all those who had confessed to him and? wished to unclear unclear from the heart. The prophet said I answer that they did not. They confessed again that some of them had not indeed spoken the feelings of their hearts.

That is, he believed the Christian as well as the Pagan religion. Thus Littlebeard was made a man of no decision of character. Immediately upon the death of Ganyodiyoh John Littlebeard left the unclear of Paganism & joined himself to the visible Church of Christ, strongly and strenuously advocating the doctrines & principles of the christian religion.\nThe Prophet was commanded by the angels to look into the dwelling of the white man. He looked & saw fetters for binding & securing criminals, ropes for hanging the murderers of their fellow man, and whips for punishing & subduing the disobedient and obstinate. He beheld a great variety of torturing instruments which he said awaited the Indians if they attempted to live after the manner o the whites.

There is great disrespect generally paid to the old people, this is not right, but the contrary should be practiced. Children must not separate themselves from their? parents, nor must they when teh strength of their parent begins to fail, turn them out of doors. But they must love them for this is right and pleasing to the Great Spirit unclear. At one time there was a difficulty among people of the Prophet and the Prophet himself. The angels advised the prophet to leave Allegany, and that from that place he should take but three steps when he should settle? himself down forever. The first step he took was to go to Tonawanda. From this place he looked back to Allegany in a vision, and saw the people that they had become drunkards and adulterers, and their land was filled with commotion on account of the great sins of the people. He says they deliberately forsook this prophet & their religions & turned to their favorite idols by the instigation & promptings of the Evil One.The next step the Prophet took was to go to Onondaga. This was his last step on earth, with the third he let himself in heaven, for at Onondaga he died.\nMy friends, it is now past noon and I will only say a few words more & close.

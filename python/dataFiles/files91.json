Tell the girls that I love them all, and would like to write to them if I could. Can not Father and Mother make me a visit before the term closes? It seems most too bad if they cant make us one good visit before E. moves away. She will have to leave her house the first of April and that will be, you know, in about five weeks now. I called at Mrs. Bowman's yesterday afternoon with Carry and Laura. We had quite a pleasant time. It was very slippery, and so the girls went clear home with me. If they had not I dont know how I should have got home for it was almost impossible to keep from falling down. This morning it was not quite as slippery but I had one good fall, however, but did not hurt me any. If Father has any money to spare, I should like to have him send me some before I go home as I have not enough to pay my tuition. I have about three dollars now and you know I owe Miss White five dollars besides seven for tuition. Give my love to Margaret and her little boys and all the rest of the folks. I saw Mary Thomas when I was in Utica Saturday she was in Roberts Room for a few minutes.

We have not heard from the girls now for three or four weeks, and that was through a letter Jane wrote to Lewis; we (that is the folks at home) have not had but one letter from them since they went away. Sarah writes home about once a week; we had a letter from her a week ago last Monday, have not heard this week yet. Mother says that John Henry has really got a little sister; is it so? if it is, what is her name? who does she look like? and what does Johnny think of her? Out Church meeting is today, and I do wish you were here to go with us to the house of God, but as that cannot be we must be contented. Three have been received by letter since you went away. Griffith Jenkins and wife, and another woman. Father is away from home this week he started Monday morning, was going to somewhere in Madison County against Tuesday where they expected to have a meeting and were going to ordain Mr. John Lloyd a young preacher, and they were to have a meeting - in Waterville today, I think it was, we expect Pa home tomorrow night on Saturday. Edward Josiah went home last Saturday to see his folks and came back Monday. Mother and Aunt went to the village Saturday and Ma got me a shawl, and they got several other things.

night. Oct. 22\n\nMy Cynthia:\n\n  I have just been reading your very welcome letter, and you cant think how much good it did me. I feel so much better after reading it, it would be vain for me to try to tell you how much. I was trying to write a composition when Elizabeth brought it up stairs, but I guess that composition must go unfinised for tonight, and I will write a few words in this, instead. I was very glad to hear that Sarah dear was so much better. I had been quite anxious to hear, ever since I was at home, as, you know, she was quite poorly, then. Tell her I want her to get well fast against I come home again because I have got a good many things that I want to tell her, that I fear I shall not be able to, if she is not pretty strong.

If you all think best, I would like to have you speak to Mr. Jenkins and see how many scholars I should be likely to have: you","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":23192,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/23192","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7990f91f72023d4592a1d1d217d78ff2.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7990f91f72023d4592a1d1d217d78ff2.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7990f91f72023d4592a1d1d217d78ff2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7990f91f72023d4592a1d1d217d78ff2.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-04T20:16:44+00:00","modified":"2020-01-16T21:52:09+00:00","filename":"7990f91f72023d4592a1d1d217d78ff2.jpg","authentication":"1c2a8a3f1f7095983977bc4b0616c2d1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_09_fl_342_004_02_o2.jpg","size":1004607,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2300,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040443115942029},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["224010+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["224010+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["224010+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7990f91f72023d4592a1d1d217d78ff2.jpg","FileDateTime":1507148155,"FileSize":1004607,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2300\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2300,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"8mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:22 10:54:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 22:40:10","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 22:40:10","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1292,"ExifImageLength":2022,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":91,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/91","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"might say that I would teach if I could get a class of about a dozen or so, and would charge about the same as they do in other schools.

Willie\n\nPlease give my love to Mrs. Griffith & Laura, and to Gwen, and remember me to all inquiring friends if any such there be.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":23212,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/23212","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/77e6cde916828b3f3bcb8a8cd8a04981.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/77e6cde916828b3f3bcb8a8cd8a04981.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/77e6cde916828b3f3bcb8a8cd8a04981.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/77e6cde916828b3f3bcb8a8cd8a04981.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-04T20:17:37+00:00","modified":"2020-01-16T21:52:10+00:00","filename":"77e6cde916828b3f3bcb8a8cd8a04981.jpg","authentication":"93e7bc387f64a54347543fb94c5de1d8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_09_fl_342_009_04_o2.jpg","size":1112522,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2238,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046028282527389},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["224127"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["224127"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["224127"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["224127"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["224127"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["224127"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"77e6cde916828b3f3bcb8a8cd8a04981.jpg","FileDateTime":1507148156,"FileSize":1112522,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2238\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2238,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:22 10:48:32","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 22:41:27","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 22:41:27","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":91,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/91","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"wished me to say to you that he does not go out for his health now quite as much as he did last spring.\nMrs. N. told me the other day to send her love to our people, when I wrote, and Callie says, \"and mine too.\"  Mary wishes to send her love to Cynthia, and says she would like to have you write to her.

Please to write to your sister,\n\nAnna\nI hope to see some of you down here before long.  till then good bye.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":23250,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/23250","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/1fdc093d8fba06673f55cfeeb43943d5.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/1fdc093d8fba06673f55cfeeb43943d5.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/1fdc093d8fba06673f55cfeeb43943d5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1fdc093d8fba06673f55cfeeb43943d5.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-04T20:19:26+00:00","modified":"2020-01-16T21:52:10+00:00","filename":"1fdc093d8fba06673f55cfeeb43943d5.jpg","authentication":"8a3a234889d86fbfc9f6ea7f13aa4b3c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_09_fl_344_008_01_o2.jpg","size":789401,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2200,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.033223947811448},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["224716"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["224716"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["224716"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["224716"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["224716"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["224716"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1fdc093d8fba06673f55cfeeb43943d5.jpg","FileDateTime":1507148158,"FileSize":789401,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2200\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2200,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:22 11:10:22","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 22:47:16","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 22:47:16","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":91,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/91","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Thursday morning\nDear Jennie,\n\n    I received a letter from you yesterday, and another one Monday, containing five dollars.

City\nThurs. Oct 29, 1874\nDear sister Jennie, \n\n  We have just received your letter.  I am so sorry I have made you so much trouble just when your hands were so full.  I had intended to attend to it myself, but after I decided to stay longer I could see no other way to do, though I did not forget how hurried you must be at this time.

Do you suppose Robbie could attend to it for us?  They want a bedstead also an old table and thought perhaps we would spare so Anna has written that they may take the one that Seth used to sleep on at least till we go home.  We don't exactly remember which it is but we cannot tell about those in the garret.  They can have the table without leaves that we took down cellar lately.  I do not  think they care for leaves and we will not miss that very much.  We have not heard from your father again.

Hope you will be able to write to us before long, for it seems so good to get letters from our home friends, and we want to know how you are getting along.  This has been a cold, wet day, but I like it better than the very warm days we have had since coming here.  They have a great deal of warm weather here, and but little snow in winter: but any quantities of mud.  It takes but a little rain to make it very muddy, and the mud here is so sticky, that it would be almost impossible to get about if it were not for the side-walks.

I am so sorry you have been having another time with your head.  I hope that it has passed off before this (the time, not the head I suppose) and that you are now quite well again.  I am afraid you all have quite too much to do, now we are gone (I mean Sarah).  We begin to feel that we really ought to be at home now, though we are enjoying ourselves here, and having good time generally.  We don't want to be selfish, you know, and we are waiting now for an answer to Sarah's last letter home.  Hope we shall have one this week.  I think we would both be quite contented to go home now, if it was thought best.  Mary do you really intend to go to New York by the first part of November?\n\nI wish you would tell Cynthia - or I will tell her.  Cynthia, when you wish to play all the parts of a piece - play all you can reach with your right hand - you can most always play three parts with your right-hand, if there should be a note or two of tenor that you can reach easier with the left-hand you had better play it so, but I think it best to play all the chords with right hand when you can and you will have your left-hand free to play a double bass if you choose.

Well, to tell the sober truth, she and Miles are engaged, and if their plans are not changed, they will probably be married sometime next spring or summer. You know he is preaching now at Little Falls, and intends to be there until spring. It is not yet decided whether he will take a charge in the Conference then, or wait another year. So until that is decided, the time for the wedding will not be, I suppose. I wish you could be at home to help her get ready - perhaps you will.  If he does not enter the Conference next summer, she will have more time, of course, but he says he doesn't want to go to work alone when he does go. It is getting dark, so I must stop.

We have had no letter from you for more than a week and feel anxious about you -- how do you stand this very hot weather.  It is very oppressive here and I hear it is much worse with you.  Do be careful not to expose yourself much during the hottest part of the day.  Sarah enjoys the warm weather, and gains strength I think, but still coughs a good deal.  Edward went away again Tuesday morn.  Mate and the boys & cousin Lysa are here yet.  Jane has been quite sick for two or three days -- is some better this afternoon.  I intended to send you a letter this week -- will have to do so soon.  We want to hear from you -- Write to  Anna","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}]

I will copy same.\n[written along the left-hand side of the page]\nMr. Osgood has brought a house & some land in Chicopee, Mass & is to move \ntheir Apr. 1st. \nI saw this in the \nSpringfield \nRepublican. \nI will add you must'nt \nhave any fears as to my \nusing or taking any im-\nproper liberties with \nyour  Document -- & it \nwill be just the same \nas though in your own \nhands - & you can kill \nit whenever it has \ndone the work necessary. \nMary had a short vaca-\ntion next week & is \ncoming home -\nJames is making sugar.\nI have heard Robins & \nBluebirds quite plenty. \nI am feeling real mean \nthis spring --Reed is at \nN. Y. & sick with Measles. \nI think it is Awfully \nmean your new tenant \ngives you trouble -- what \ncan you do to him to \nmake him behave - I \nwish your& my farms were both \nwell sold. & you at Hudson in that \npretty pleasant home as before.\n[right-hand side of letter]\nI wish you could come back least.

Norvell's address (he was then at St. Paul) ascertained by enquiry\nthat there was no reason to suppose that he would not as soon join the\nNinth as the Tenth, and I then proceeded to propose the change to him.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":65675,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/65675","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/13f0c37df413a626c631628d50674d86.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/13f0c37df413a626c631628d50674d86.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/13f0c37df413a626c631628d50674d86.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/13f0c37df413a626c631628d50674d86.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-24T17:38:00+00:00","modified":"2020-01-29T21:16:46+00:00","filename":"13f0c37df413a626c631628d50674d86.jpg","authentication":"73ab269bae0fa089e3b7c0eac13d16aa","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3039_BX02_FL058_00005_o2 copy.jpg","size":561433,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2254,"compression_ratio":0.046126474744487000467785264845588244497776031494140625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20120611"],"TimeCreated":["092712+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120611"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20120611"],"TimeCreated":["092712+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120611"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20120611"],"TimeCreated":["092712+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120611"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"13f0c37df413a626c631628d50674d86.jpg","FileDateTime":1521913068,"FileSize":561433,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2254\"","Height":2254,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2254,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:24 08:48:51","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":312},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":966,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4186},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:11 09:27:12","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:11 09:27:12","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":46,"SubSecTimeDigitized":46,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2254,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.71670190270015154965221881866455078125,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.90476190480012519401498138904571533203125,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1003,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1003","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"For that purpose I went to the room of Gen.

More to the point, I got\nevery tribe and band to appoint two delegates to accompany\nme to Washington.\nOf the Comanches you could not name a single chief","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":65685,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/65685","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/0aac0fc53cfdbd51cf6eb907b96fe5e7.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/0aac0fc53cfdbd51cf6eb907b96fe5e7.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/0aac0fc53cfdbd51cf6eb907b96fe5e7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0aac0fc53cfdbd51cf6eb907b96fe5e7.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-24T17:38:11+00:00","modified":"2020-01-29T21:16:46+00:00","filename":"0aac0fc53cfdbd51cf6eb907b96fe5e7.jpg","authentication":"ae727a31c7ab5d32c3b2ff0a5ecb244f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3039_BX02_FL058_00013_o2.jpg","size":1240139,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2869,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040023591908395002303411303046232205815613269805908203125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120611"],"TimeCreated":["093055+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120611"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120611"],"TimeCreated":["093055+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120611"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120611"],"TimeCreated":["093055+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120611"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0aac0fc53cfdbd51cf6eb907b96fe5e7.jpg","FileDateTime":1521913069,"FileSize":1240139,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2869\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2869,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:07:25 09:59:46","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":180},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:11 09:30:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:11 09:30:55","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":97,"SubSecTimeDigitized":97,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2334,"ExifImageLength":2928,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.71670190270015154965221881866455078125,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.90476190480012519401498138904571533203125,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1003,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1003","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"or important man, not at the Council, and\naltho Padua-comb & Mow-way have not themselves\npromised to join our party, they have promised to send\ngood representative men.\nSomething may yet occur to break up our plans\nso I am not over-confident, but I think\nit probable that about the 18th inst, we shall\nstart from this place with Gov't. transportation\nfor the R.R.

While there wed? received a letter from Mrs Grierson and it gave us all much pleasure to hear from her. I hear from the papers that Satanta has been killing some cattle, and judge from the way in which the affair is put before the public that somebody is anxious to get up a war for the purpose of exterminating the old chap. In doing so they would unclear at the cost of some millions of dollars be enabled to telegraph several \"great Indian fights\" in which an indefinite number of women and children were killed. I sincerely hope another Indian war may be avoided.\nGeneral Sherman told me when in Washington, that an effort was being made to procure the abandonment of Fort Sill and the Reservation on the ground that it was a harbor and rallying center from which the Indians made their raids upon Texas unclear.

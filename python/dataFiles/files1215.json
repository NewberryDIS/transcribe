Aug 28th\n  Dear Nettie I commence a letter to you but have not much to write as seems quite dull here now and I should  be decidedly lonely if we had not so much  to do  as we leave no time for anything namely but work, work.

H. much more new, than Milo, but containing a valuable water privilege.

We are all well, James has had an ill time but is better, Almeda is pretty well now, but cannot walk far; little Lucy is not very well to day, owning to the heat perhaps; sister Lucy enjoys herself very well, has not got much acquainted yet; it seems rather odd to me at first to go to meeting and about, with a sister taller than myself; I suppose 'you have' grown out of my knowledge quite as much as she has: but you are old enough to obtain the growth and stature of a man- a tall man- I like to see a tall man,-but be sure and have your intellectual and moral growth correspond with your physical, and then you will be a man indeed.\nWe had at Sabbath school celebration of the 4th which was very interesting & with which Lucy was exceedingly delighted, particularly the singing which was performed entirely by about a hundred little girls & which was really very fine. Did you read an account of the steamboat excursion of the sabbath schools of New York? The great temperance dinner you have I suppose seen a notice of: it is said to have been the greatest occasion of the kind ever known here. Mr. Whipple and Bush attended it, and James probably would, but he wished","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94451,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94451","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/8705be83f8aca09ae43240f2eef5e027.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/8705be83f8aca09ae43240f2eef5e027.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/8705be83f8aca09ae43240f2eef5e027.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8705be83f8aca09ae43240f2eef5e027.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:51:31+00:00","modified":"2020-06-13T19:16:18+00:00","filename":"8705be83f8aca09ae43240f2eef5e027.jpg","authentication":"d3d62d48ea8ccf9f2e7bc1575880f4d2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_10_003_002_o2.jpg","size":1466175,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2870,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047302071234998},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002054"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002054"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002054"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8705be83f8aca09ae43240f2eef5e027.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649019,"FileSize":1466175,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2870\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2870,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:34:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:20:54","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:20:54","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":79,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3098,"ExifImageLength":3885,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"out of town that day, so he got a carry all, and we all, (six precious souls), went out to Dedham.

the barn some, with Eliab to wait upon him We had a very violent rain-storm yesterday, which has raised the river most to the garden\ndifferent handwriting:  \n\nDear son N.?. we can and do give you ever so many directions but after all you must act your own judgment and according to to circumstances  I am kintting you some mitten and going to knit a pair of worsted gloves but cannot send them before you ?

If this is true in the affairs of ordinary life, is it not much more so in religion? I am sure the greatest hindrance I have had to progress in these things of religion, has been a failure in acting up promptly to the dictates of conscience, particularly in little things:  a wavering mind as well as failure and neglect of duty, brings doubt and darkness on the mind and leads to unbelief, against which young converts, especially, need to set a watch.  In cases of conversion which are marked and striking in their character there is less danger in this source than in the more common cases, where the change is so gradual that the individual cannot himself tell the precise time when he was renewed in the spirit of his mind: the question whether this great deed has taken place, is to be determined by your present willingness to do what God requires, as I read today in smudged Nevin's sermons: - he says - Are you willing to accept of Christ as y smudged 'substitute and surely, to be cleansed by his blood, to be clothed with his righteousness, to sit at his feet? Are you ready to be evermore his devoted disciple, and to glorify God with your body and spirit, which are his?

The three eldest sons, two of whom are twins, and all those between the ages of 21 and 23, follow the sea though one is at home now on account of poor health, was unfortunate and lost all his wages, was sick in a hospital &c. One son has lately been at home who goes second mate, after being common sailor for five years - he receives 25 per month now, and expects to be able to get a captain's birth(sic) soon. He says no one can expect to go as mater or mate till after going before the mast at least five years, but enough of sailor business, in which I conclude you do not take much interest now: I want you should write me one of your real particular letters, giving a faithful and detailed account of your situation, pursuits and especially the employment of your time out of school I hope you do not pay away your money and spend your time in that foolery which may be properly called acting out the boys - you perceive I am thinking of some scenes and incidents which I have witnessed in time past when you three boys have been together, at home, but I trust your minds are occupied with useful things now.\nThere is very little of interest going on here now, Mr. Bradbourne\nWritten up right side:\nThis is not such such a letter as I would gladly have written if I had had time to arrange my thoughts better but such as it is I [?] it and send an answer to your affectionate sister \nE.

Installation day, and you can have time to write me a good long letter besides attending meeting. Why do you not attend writing school? Dear brother Elial? I have used ink? as you see most all my paper and as you may have reason to think, exhausted most all my store of ideas, but I will just say that I want to know how you get along with your studies, how you like the school and what improvement you are making write me an account of yourself, what you are studying, whether you write compositions, how often you attend to writing, how far from the academy you board Dr Ob??. My school is tolerably pleasant, about 50 in number we have had extremely pleasant weather here all the fall which is quite favorable for me, - Some persons here are almost running stark mad after Miller doctrines. One of the students has been dismissed from the Seminary and account of his extravagant conduct: A Mrs. Marden? whom all national people think is deranged, holds Miller meeting every even at her house, confidently affirming that next Aw.? will be the end of the world. Boys, I have you mountains? social prayer among yourselves.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94467,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94467","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b5671a9158ecc00e169f7c6ca179aee8.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b5671a9158ecc00e169f7c6ca179aee8.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b5671a9158ecc00e169f7c6ca179aee8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b5671a9158ecc00e169f7c6ca179aee8.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:51:54+00:00","modified":"2020-06-15T00:26:52+00:00","filename":"b5671a9158ecc00e169f7c6ca179aee8.jpg","authentication":"59549af278f6be0bd8c5a76957670d9d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_11_002_004_o2.jpg","size":1141555,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2899,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.036460688871003},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002250"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002250"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002250"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b5671a9158ecc00e169f7c6ca179aee8.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649020,"FileSize":1141555,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2899\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2899,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:34:45","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:22:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:22:50","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":58,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3112,"ExifImageLength":3864,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Miss E.A.

I was sorry it happened so that I saw so little of you, when you were at home: I have scarcely seen you for a year, and one's feelings and habits of thoughts sometimes alter rapidly, - and undergo such transitions at your susceptible age, that ere? long I shall scarcely feel that I am acquainted with you as a sister should be, - an elder sister, - with that interior apartment of the thoughts and feelings, which alone furnishes the key to the character.  If we are ourselves duly acquainted with this inner chamber' of the soul' we shall find frequent occasion to employ the true light of experience, to correct false estimates, erroneous impressions, and unwarrantable conclusions, and, though this is especially the case, in early youth, yet I suppose we can at almost any period of our lives, in taking a retrospect of a few years, find our views of things materially changed; not indeed in the immutable principles of smirth?

Solomon calls him a fool who is wise in his own eyes and certain it is, that the knowledge, which experience brings to a rightly biased mind, leads to true humility.  I think if we analyze closely the state of mind, produced by, and accompanying, real Christian humility, we shall be convinced that one of its important elements, is, a just estimate of one's self, - which is the only solid foundation of that self-reliance, self-progression - or if you please, self-esteem, so essential to successful life. Self confidence may, it is true, arise from an overwhelming self-conceit, but such will, if not corrected by the teachings of experience, be likely to lead to disgrace rather than honour.  I think I have heard you express the opinion, that this element of self-confidence in your character is deficient, and needs cultivating, now would it not be the most effectual means of attaining this important, this truly noble quality, as well as the way most consistent with Christian obligation, to pray and labor for, true Christian humility - such a sense of your own nothingness, and the vanity of the world, and the supreme importance of being to God as the one great object of life, - as will raise you entirely above the fear of man.

best human character has faults enough to spoil it.' There have been fifty scholars in the academy this summer, MIss Caverno is coming back this fall; Rebecca & Flora Tower are at home now, have been in Boston two years past, in a cap factory, expect to return again before winter. Why would not some such plan do for Lucy? To take a school of small scholars in Woonsocket for instance, and enjoy the advantages that city life offers; -- by they way why do'nt you write to Uncle Pel. and see if he cannot get you a chance there, to take a private or public school as soon as your fall term closes? It would do no harm to write, and might do good.  I intend to take a journey to Boston in two or three weeks, be there at the examinations and try to get a situation in the public schools there, -- if I find no chance in Bangor, -- perhaps take a small private school in Boston if practicable, until I can by dint of perseverance and importunity obtain a chance in the public school, which most probably I could do after a time. I shall first however see what can be done at Bangor; shall stop there two or three days on my way fro that purpose. Mary some expects to go to Portland, when I go to B. to meet her mother who stops at the springs longer than she intended at first, if she does, I shall start in a fortnight. Mother is writing to Mrs. Child to day to thank her for her gift to you and tell her of my journey or rather late in the day but no matter in this case; her brother in law, Mr. Child of Argyle, called here a week or two ago, he was travelling as an agent of the Bangor Gazette & a paper published by the Fourier society, of which he seemed quite in favour, he an Charles talked some time upon it. I do'nt know but we have written to you that we have one chamber all finished but plastering and painting; Charles hoped to have been able to do it and paint the front outside front entry and portice before haying but was unable to 'get time,' and it will not be done until late in the fall. He has just begun haying, will get his first load","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94476,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94476","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/9819be1a38492d0b53aefa78b38f0f10.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/9819be1a38492d0b53aefa78b38f0f10.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/9819be1a38492d0b53aefa78b38f0f10.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9819be1a38492d0b53aefa78b38f0f10.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:52:06+00:00","modified":"2020-07-08T20:39:21+00:00","filename":"9819be1a38492d0b53aefa78b38f0f10.jpg","authentication":"dc04b5556cf8e7fedc63ac01e645b721","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_11_005_003_o2.jpg","size":1398919,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2822,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04589990681681},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002414"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002414"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002414"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"9819be1a38492d0b53aefa78b38f0f10.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649020,"FileSize":1398919,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2822\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2822,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:35:04","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:24:14","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:24:14","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3077,"ExifImageLength":3925,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"into the barn to day: he has bought a horse-rake by which Kate can rake s much hay afternoons as two or three men; he does not expect any other help that Lemuel his hired man.

glad you are a good kind boy about writing goon soon? in the way of well doing I have been counting the days to the first Wednesday of Sept I think it would be rather bad for you to be absent next term & I hope you wont have to be I did calculate to sell both yoke of oxen but now he is determind to let the farm next year if he can and if he does must furnish one yoke on the farm but thinks it would be better to hire money if we could than that you should leave next term the oxen are gaining weekly now and I think if he can get them Beef it would be better to sell them and buy another and cheaper on credit to put on the farm than to have money C's health is not near as good as it us'd to be he has a lame shoulder most all the time so that he can only sleep on one side- he has abused himself by hard work- we have had rain rain, rain almost every day this three weeks and now the hay needs to be all cut at once I am afraid a great deal will be wanted for the want of labor to get it

time enough in listless inaction to write many a letter, but my school is fatiguing, and half the time, out of school, I feel languid and indisposed to mental exertion, however slight. In higher schools, the converse with scientific studies, & the contact of minds somewhat mature, may tend to stimulate the teacher, and counteract the lassitude and weariness felt by the labours of teaching: but I have to constantly, contend with all kinds and degrees of roguery, and restlessness; with petulance and pertness, in the part of scholars themselves, which I must labour to meet the expectations of their parents, often unreasonable, to have their darlings brought forward in a course of rapid improvement, in spite of dull heads, and, more frequent, inveterate dislike to application. This, however, is but one side of the picture, and much may be said on the other side, I have a 'fine school', am considered 'an fine teacher', and probably there are hardly twenty young ladies in Bangor,","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94490,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94490","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/ae963cf057a416e0bad17cf2d78aea39.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/ae963cf057a416e0bad17cf2d78aea39.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/ae963cf057a416e0bad17cf2d78aea39.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ae963cf057a416e0bad17cf2d78aea39.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:52:26+00:00","modified":"2020-06-19T11:51:36+00:00","filename":"ae963cf057a416e0bad17cf2d78aea39.jpg","authentication":"2054f5f2176783c07d18afa28437fb0e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_12_003_002_o2.jpg","size":1495237,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2969,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046631145291469},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002630"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002630"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002630"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ae963cf057a416e0bad17cf2d78aea39.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649021,"FileSize":1495237,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2969\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2969,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:35:36","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:26:30","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:26:30","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3205,"ExifImageLength":3885,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"who would not jump to take my place, and I have great reason to be thankful upon so good a situation, far exceeding my expectations or perhaps deserts. i have an average attendance of 40, of all ages between three and fifteen, and all degrees of mischiefousness, yet a very pleasant school; some sweet children.

He expects to return over the Alps, through Germany, and get back to Eng. in June or July. --  I want you should write home and here too, just when you shall be at Bangor, as I suppose Charles will be down, and I intend to dismiss my school for a week, though it will come in the midst of a quarter, -- and go up at the same time. I suppose you will stay a fortnight but I shall have to return in a week, and when I come back one or both the boys can go p, which arrangement would make a saving in stage fare: Lucy ought to have made them consent to wait till 1st June, then she would be at home all the time instead of merely coming for a few days: I hope it will be so that we can all meet there then, for perhaps we may never be able to again, in like circumstances. As to your prospects, I think you have every reason to look on the bright side, and trust Providence that your way will be made clear: I fear you do not realise the sacred duty, as well as importance of a prudent care of health. I wish you would write to me, whenever you can conveniently, whether I do or not, we all want to hear from you often and particularly. When you have time I wish you would give me your opinion upon Capital punishment, and also upon the propriety of withdrawing contributions from the American board, in favour of the new Union board.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94494,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94494","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/a01ffd3829b3df6ee091dc927f12857d.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/a01ffd3829b3df6ee091dc927f12857d.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/a01ffd3829b3df6ee091dc927f12857d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a01ffd3829b3df6ee091dc927f12857d.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:52:32+00:00","modified":"2020-07-08T21:12:23+00:00","filename":"a01ffd3829b3df6ee091dc927f12857d.jpg","authentication":"a5e8a8d1234bb45d01cf5c1072a4461e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_12_003_006_o2.jpg","size":1089595,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2871,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.035140517563889},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002704"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002704"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002704"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a01ffd3829b3df6ee091dc927f12857d.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649021,"FileSize":1089595,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2871\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2871,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:35:44","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:27:04","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:27:04","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3185,"ExifImageLength":3993,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"May 4th 1846\nBowd.

Dear brother Isaac, I received your letter just a fortnight since, and give you many thanks. I was hoping you would write, though I knew I did now deserve one, as I had not answered your last except by a few words in mother's when at Milo. I meant to have written you while there, but we all had too much talking to do to allow time for much else. I thought then that I should write you two or three letters by this time for strange as it may appear from my practice - I do really like to write especially to own folk's. I am ashamed of the plea of want of time, & it certainly is not want of inclination, so I do not know why I have not written oftener unless it be chargable upon the old 'thief of time' procrastination. If I had written you as soon as I intended I should have sent it to Turner, for I thought you there till a short time before I received your last. I am very glad of your good prospects there, it is another proof of how much reason you have to trust Providence that your way will be made plain, nay smooth before you if the language of your heart is, 'What wilt thou have me to do?' - I think you are favored in respect to boarding place to judge from the one of the family I have seen. I have a high opinion of Josephine Hall, though not much acquainted with her, have met her a few times: there is a dignity in her looks and appearance, rather uncommon; you have reason to think yourself flattered in resembling her in looks; her engagement must be recent as I heard nothing about it when she was here. She frequently spends a long time here I believe. As to Abby Bartlett, though not an intimate friend, nor indeed a calling acquaintance, I frequently meet her and feel somewhat acquainted. She is a very well-meaning and estimable person, though not to me at all prepossessing in manners & appearance: I had a right good visit from Lucy: she was here","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94496,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94496","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c6a72f8c24d19c8f8c63d77a21a1ea9d.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/c6a72f8c24d19c8f8c63d77a21a1ea9d.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/c6a72f8c24d19c8f8c63d77a21a1ea9d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c6a72f8c24d19c8f8c63d77a21a1ea9d.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:52:34+00:00","modified":"2020-07-08T22:29:26+00:00","filename":"c6a72f8c24d19c8f8c63d77a21a1ea9d.jpg","authentication":"10ea71e23f55512d6ae99157e04aff10","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_12_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1495256,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2952,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046900281039847},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002723"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002723"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002723"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c6a72f8c24d19c8f8c63d77a21a1ea9d.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649021,"FileSize":1495256,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2952\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2952,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:35:49","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:27:23","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:27:23","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3198,"ExifImageLength":3899,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"a little more than a fortnight: when she came, she did intend to stay a part of the time at Jos's boarding house, but we concluded she had best stay with me: Mrs. Palmer was very polite and kind, asked her to stay a week longer, said her daughter might visit her at Milo next summer so I conclude she do'nt intend to take pay for board. She went into school with me most every day: helped me some, and spent her time partly in drawing for which she has really talent as well as taste.

He arrived before the others and was conducted into a carpetted (sic) room of moderate size but very high to secure coolness: no chairs, but a low cushioned seat running all round the room about or less than a foot from the floor with cushions at the back so that one would recline rather than sit: soon after he was seated there servants came in one with something resembling a coffee pot, full of water - another with an empty vessel or tray, a third with towels: they think it an abomination to dip their hands in a dish and wash as we do but it must be running water to carry off all the filth; their habits are far removed from neatness in some other respects. - next servants brought in a censer with some aromatic gum burning, placed it before him & wrapped him in a large sheet to start he might inhale the incense; after this the mistress of the house appeared with a bottle of strong scented rose water - which she sprinkled very plentifully all over him; lastly the master of the house came seated himself near him & began a strain of compliments such as \"I take the greatest delight in your company,\" \"I feel greatly honoured that you are my guest\" \"This room & this house is lightened by your presence\" &c.\nThe dinner itself occupied an hour three small round tables about six inches from the floor at which he sat with feet doubled under him.

J. & E. go on as usual I suppose you know more about them than I do for I see only once in a little age.

We went into the library which is really quite a room, at least to my eye, with quite a cabinet of curiosities specimens of heathen ingenuity, idols, or enough to fill one small room. Lucy was not smart enough to go that day, which was a pity, for we could not put it off: her health is certainly improving the effect I think in part of Dr. McRuen's medicine which she ought to have taken long ago. I have just read Lucy's epistle and she seems to have said all there is to tell you:- her 'Sam's book' that he brought for her to read the very day it got to town is very engaging.\nTruly I never before so forcibly felt the superiority of those noble souls and lofty intellects lodged in iron frames, who accomplished so much in the revolutionary struggle; & against such nolds?; it seems to me the proportion of such men is small now.

If you have not yet got acquainted with her do not fail to do so, and from me, give her a great deal of love, tell her I often think of her, that I always shall remember her, with much affection, the playmate of my childhood, and friend of my youth.\nTo Mrs. Parsons too, and to cousin Joseph A. give my most affectionate remembrance I often think with pleasure of my pleasant visit to their house and almost envy you the happiness of seeing all our dear friends there though very glad that you have the opportunity to do it,\nWhere you go to Winchester, I want you to do me the favour to go to my Uncle Elisha Rich, make yourself known to him, and tell him all about Charles, A. and I, and give my best regards & respects to him & his wife: I have been an inmate of his family for months and have

I wish Joseph was as favourably situated for the health of his mind.

Arbor W. J. to give freedom of mind and healthful action,\nI should not look upon it at all as a misfortune,- in the end- if he should fail in his present effort in business, for it might be the means used by a kind Providence to lead him into circumstances to promote a more free, happy and harmonious action of the powers God has given him,- at present cramped, and in a measure turned from their nature bias: I know him to possess a keen susceptibility to enjoyment, but he seems now to allow himself none. Eliab returned yesterday from a week's sojourn at Milo, the particulars of which you will hear I suppose from them.

not it may be real dignity: but so called: I believe in general, what you claim for yourself, others will accord you, I mean in regard to the estimation in which you are held.\nIt seems to me too that a habit of deciding and expressing one's self, promptly, especially in that business, would do much to help one forward.

to her: she was then not 18,- the time when the world and its vanities have most power over the mind, she does not regard herself as having been pious then yet her noble regard to principle, led her to give up the good opinion of her friend, expose herself to obloquy and neglect. I will relate something of her at a still earlier period of life: After the death of her mother, (who you know was mother's oldest sister, whom I remember perfectly & with much affection). I visited at her fathers, & spent several days: she was then 15 or 16, the oldest of seven children, I spent the sabbath there and after tea, she gathered all the children together into a retired chamber, had us all kneel round the bed, while she led in prayer: this as I knew, had been Aunt's practice, and this good girl, putting away all false shame, simply to do her duty, had kept up the practice ever since her mother's death. Is there not something uncommon in such a character?\nAs I have gone so far, I will tell a little more of her history: A little previous to her mother's death, while on a visit to her relations in Barre, she became acquainted with a young man of that place by the name of Lee, he belonged to one of the very first families, was wealth & moved in a high circle, he was much pleased with her, for she was interesting in her appearance; he visited her after her return home, and it resulted in an engagement: after awhile some of the relations from Athol who knew all about him, sent word that he was dissipated somewhat, in his habits: she dismissed him at once, though I have no doubt at a great sacrifice to her own feelings: I can not help thinking that if it had not been for this early blighting of her affections and hopes, she would not have united her desting? with that old kunks? of a Dickinson twine her age: I believe that she set her own feelings aside, and married because of her father's narrow circumstances there, the necessities of her younger sisters, and her need of a home. When I was there three years ago, she said to me, with much emphasis, 'do'nt you marry for a home'.\nI am sorry to hear that Joseph A. is a follower of Parker, but Unitarianism lends to infidelity, and it is not strange: I cannot but hope that Uncle Joseph & aunt are real christians; they have been grounded in the truth in infamy though their children have only been under Unitarian influence.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94514,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/94514","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/e40be447edbf106142ac9ce1bf2e7afa.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/e40be447edbf106142ac9ce1bf2e7afa.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/e40be447edbf106142ac9ce1bf2e7afa.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e40be447edbf106142ac9ce1bf2e7afa.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:53:00+00:00","modified":"2020-05-19T19:36:57+00:00","filename":"e40be447edbf106142ac9ce1bf2e7afa.jpg","authentication":"e00d570b512f6379af19b88345c4f59c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_13_004_004_o2.jpg","size":1681877,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

I think you are formed to enjoy social intercourse and to be made better as well as more useful to others by it, and who is not? if your brother Joseph would commune with his fellow beings, open the stores of his accurately well-filled mind, impart and diffuse the just sentiment and kind feelings of his heart, if he could easily and gracefully act upon other minds with his strong, common sense and moral worth how much good might he accomplish, and how much enjoyment he would receive in return! Constituted as he is, there must be a void felt by him a lack of communion with other minds for I know he is formed to enjoy it with kindred spirits;\nDo you stand erect nowadays?

1st 1848. I wish you a happy new year. According to Johnson, 'happiness consists in a constant employment, for a desired end, with the consciousness of continued progress.' I wish you a year of improvement to yourself and usefulness to others. It seems to me it would be unwise to give up if you can avoid doing so, mental cultivation and refinement by means of books or society, while no doubt you will be gaining the strength and improvement of mind derived from an increase of practical knowledge from the various sources within the range of your experience. A week ago this eve (Sat.) Joseph and Eliab spent the evening with me, in my chamber; we had a fine time, - a bright fire on the hearth, some nuts and raisins to regale ourselves, and sweet converse for 'the feast of reason be.' J. brought some poetry for me to see, cut out of the 'Whig' which I am convinced he wrote, though he would not say so, it was upon the Mexican war and was fine, but do'nt you allude to it to him, for he will think I had no right to mention it as his: It appears to me sometimes that he is not in his right vocation, the one best fitted to employ or develop the powers with which he is endowed, perhaps by his failure in his present pursuits, Providence will prepare the way for some other place: he would do well as a lawyer and possibly may be one yet; I do'nt know that there is danger of his failing, but it is a very dull time in business, some heavy firms here have lately failed.\nDo you write some good long letters to Eliab, he feels backward about writing, probably because of early deficiency in spelling, writing &c and especially because generally you have written your letters chiefly to J. and only to him with perhaps only a message to I. E. is a noble hearted fellow is going to make a 'first' man: in his manners and deportment universally pleasing, and when as old as his older brothers, bids fair to make a man as truly valuable as they though unlike it may be.

had the pleasure a few days ago of reading quite a letter from you to Joseph, containing many topics of interest, which I suppose have been discussed between you: when J showed it me, I could not stay to read, I had considerable difficulty in obtaining it from him, that I might carry it home with because he said I should wear it out! What is the reason you do not write such letters to your brother Eliab? he would appreciate them, and he feels the difference you make between him and Joseph in your correspondence. Do you say that he does not write such letters or so frequent as Joseph does? You are the older brother, commence writing such regularly to him, and see if you do not get answers. -\nEliab is a noble little fellow and promising: has considerable ready wit and talent, and is very pleasing in his manners; a while ago at an evening visit here, Mary Pomroy unclear him; soon afterwards he sent her a miniature copy of Mrs. Flemans, beautiful, with a nice little note containing six or eight lines of poetry addressed to her, very appropriate and really pretty, the whole was done delicately and handsomely, and gives a favourable impression of the young man: he calls up to see me usually every Sunday while I go down to the store to see Joseph two or three times a week, - he seldom comes to see me. Eliab and I passed Tues. eve at Mr. Pomroy's.\nNow let us talk a little about the coming \"vacasion (sic)', not a particularly joyous one to me, but one that must be prepared for and met, and will soon be upon us. 4 weeks from Sat. Apr. 15th my term is out, and the time is fixed for the middle of the ensuing week, if you can be there as soon, if not, the week after: now it is very important for me to know, as well as for them exactly what day you will be here in Bangor, ready to go up: the fact is, as you already, perhaps, that Lucy found it advisable and necessary to invite as guests\n\nMiss Doe (my Lissie) with whom Lucy is more intimate than any other girl, and Mary Pomroy who you know spent a summer at Milo, has great interest in all there, has wanted to visit there ever since, and is much delighted at the idea of going. Now it is rather doubtful whether Joseph will go at that time: he has just returned from spending a week there, & is not fond of being there with any company you know: at Charles' wedding

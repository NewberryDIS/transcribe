She went twice to Grafton Fresh today, thier child is very sick____I almost think hard of Joseph was very disappointed 2 or 3 lost mails, he has not written to me only once since he went away.  I feel very anxious about him .  I want to know how long he means to stay & whether is getting better___I don't think Jane could mend that cloak he had last winter.  It's too much solid and too small.  I can fix her warm enough I guess unless it is very much colder Saturday than it is today-I hardly know whether to send Janes old hood.  I am thinking that I can take the two and rip and color them and make me one that figured silk you know is pretty good but if you can make use of it for her I will send it.\n\n I expect I can sell my wool here at Cushing for 27 cents a pound and shall have money enough to get a cloak.  So don't trouble yourself any thing about it at present. You will have enough to do about these days- too much I\u2019m afraid - you are good kind daughter to think so much about me when you have so much to do-I guess I can fix my muff  over well enough,

I am so glad you are getting well so smart but I rejoice with humbling lest you be ? down again in a fine day, take care I charge you and go forward. Am very glad to hear of Eliab's being so well employ'd- moreover I think it would on the whole be no loss to him if he should \"loaf,, all this winter if thereby he can get a well back & sound health provided nevertheless that he should not get so fond of the business as not to be willing to have it off.

Jan. 15 1836\n\nDear Mother\n\n         When Charles was down I stayed out of school in the forenoon. Charles said that he should be back to Mrs. Parkers by 11 or 12o clock for the bundle. I waited till after 2 (school time) in hopes of seeing him, but he did not come and when I came home from school the girl said that he had just went away from here so I went down in hope of seeing him but could not. A Mrs. Stickney makes my Jacket, it is not done yet. On the 14th as I was going to school I heard somebody a woman calling my name Isaac. I could not think who It was at first I went and showed her the way to Mr. Penney's. She stayed there till the 13th about noon then went to Mr. Fitto's. She did not start for Boston till - (I dont know yet) - Wednesday 7 oclock in the morning. On the 15 she gave me a letter for you and told me to send these panttloons to be fixed. In [sav?ing?]] I want to have my knees on the nood some of the time and my clothes are so thin, that there is a little hole in the black clothes! I thought that I would send them white mittens up to have them leathered for they have holes in them . I start for school at 4 of 9 the first thing is reading a chapter in the bible in the morning. Wednesday afternoon is nearly all devoted to Reading and Speaking. I have both at once. All the reading and Parsing book is the first Class book.

There is not any special attention given to Writing but any one is at liberty to write as much of the time as he gets his lessons well. I have wrote a good long letter to Mayo 2 1\/2 pages to go by - Aunt Esther I meant to have wrote to, Ann Lucy and so forth, but had not time. I wish that if you hant got my vest done that you would not make it like this one for it keeps - the under flap corner wont stay up and if I pin it up - the - it puffs right out before, I pin it so that it does very well though. I forgot to ask Charles how the hay went. I am in a great hurry to know about it. Eliab must write all about it - how much the hogs and cow weighes whether the shed is full of wood and the threshing done - and about the Stove and every thing too he can think of. I am not ready to begin the Reader I suppose my Jacket is done. I shall get it tonight. I suppose that good school has begun. Eliab must write about it.

now I intreat you to be on your guard and govern yourselves not let your time slip away unimproved and do not fail constantly and earnestly to seek to God for his blessing on all you do.  As I do think you are good boys to learn, I regret that I cannot continue you in school - but you know you can learn at home some. I think it rather an extravagant price that I have to give for your board you will be sensible it is more than I can afford. I have pretty much concluded to send for you about the 20th of this month- and perhaps shall let you go again a while in the fall I think it probable I can get board there for you at a good place for a dollar a week which I think is enough for children your age.

It was so cold from Friday till Yesterday morning as to freeze the ground some nights.\n Yesterday E. & myself set the fire into the peice above the brook on the interval, it has ran all over it and done considerable good I expect. We then went to the \"Opening\" or \"Crock & Chopping\" and lit up the \"Swale\" this side (East) and these little blue-jointed meadows north of the opening. It ran like wildfire and he & I to run as fast as our legs would let us to keep out of its way. The fire has run nearly all over between the \"Cr. Ch.\" and the B.Brook, and back north I know not how far, crossed the Piscataquis & burnt your pile of wood I believe. I do not know but it will cross the B.B. & come down.\nAug. 11 We finished sowing the wheat today and observed 14 bushels of Oats - Oats on the upper part of the interval (this side of the brook). The wheat was got in unusually early & well this year finished 1 day earlier than we began last year, and the ground was warm and dry and well harrowed and bushed. We sowed wheat on the rye (if it deserves the name) and out west where the Potatoes were last year.\nAint it smokey none down your way now a days tis here a lot the fires are running over towards Porter's Mills, the Cain settlement and especially in  a south-east direction tho' I do not know in what vicinity. If the weather holds dry fire will go all through the woods.\nYesterday the wind blew strong from the S. and the fire came across the river - it has been on the bog several days and tore and rore up through like an devourin flame. It burnt all over out to the potatoe hole and so on up to the Billington's clear to the fields. We had to fight it all the afternoon to keep it out of fences leading to the barn.\nMr. Ellis got our long ladder and set it up onto the roof of their barn and kept a boy up there to prevent catching on the roof while the rest of his crew tore down the roof - the fire took in the yard several times.\n Our buildings were not so much exposed as those of Messrs. Ellis & Billington. It burnt out fences some so that we can use the pasture back of the barn none this summer. We have a rainstorm here today.\n\n[upside down] Milo May 8 1839\n\n Having  ? ? ? about domestic episodes a good length, I'll try to quizz your last letter which we recieved day before yesterday koz I feel too lazy to answer it. It was mailed at Brownville so the postage was 4 cts less than if it had been at Bangor. How happened it? When you send such words as \"caput, caepit, ergo etc.\" please send a translation if convenient but please send the words afore described whether or noe I luv to see em.\n\nI rejoice that your stumps burned so well tother Saturday.\nYou write that you tucked the \"Traffic\" into the Post Master (P.M.) I should like to know whereabouts you tucked it into him. Ha! Ha! HA! Ha!\n19 I should think it would have been less trouble to put it into the post office. Have you an index rerum? If you have not got one or go look at Mr. Hatch and make 1 etc. etc. so tell me how to do it for I want one. I should think it would be well for you to keep up an acquaintance with Mr. Hatch?\n20 you know the field up on the interval next to the Marston Lot - Well we have sowed about 1\/2 thereof with oats - the rest planted 1\/2 with potatoes and the rest with beans and corn not corn & beans also piled about 1\/2 Acre joining it on the East which we intend to plough and sow with oats this spring. We have sown 9 bushels wheat & 19 Oats. \n[right hand side] Isaac and Charles 1839 May","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97674,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97674","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/a10178c51f2561accc6e2fc45233d884.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/a10178c51f2561accc6e2fc45233d884.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/a10178c51f2561accc6e2fc45233d884.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a10178c51f2561accc6e2fc45233d884.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:13:15+00:00","modified":"2020-07-30T03:20:51+00:00","filename":"a10178c51f2561accc6e2fc45233d884.jpg","authentication":"35962249f784a8f21f273760b94f1608","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_74_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1387386,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2312,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05556300461361},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180619"],"TimeCreated":["034834"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180619"],"TimeCreated":["034834"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180619"],"TimeCreated":["034834"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a10178c51f2561accc6e2fc45233d884.jpg","FileDateTime":1587316296,"FileSize":1387386,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2312\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2312,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:19 16:09:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:19 03:48:34","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:19 03:48:34","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":86,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3280,"ExifImageLength":5106,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1234,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1234","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"May 20th Dear brother Silly I have got a birthday; have you?

I have got a clever little girl eleven years old Olive Packard sister to Mrs. Hagar she helps me nicely about chores etc. & goes to school. C. has bought him a horse cart Sat. He fill & rigg'd them on to the ox cart & puts on both horses he has gone away with cart & horses to work out his part of an additional tax of $200 on the middle or Brownville road (mount hunger uncle Jim calls it)- J.M. & E.W. are gone up the interval in thier boat (they caulk'd & tar'd it yesterday) to hoeing corn beans etc. took thier dinner with them so I am quite alone today. My health is not so good generally this summer as it has normally been I suppose I have work'd too hard. you will wonder why I let Lucy go. I do need her at home some but I thought it would be for her advantage to be there a while as she will enjoy many privileges for improving her mind and manner which she could not have here I hope she will rightly appreciate them. I wish you to write to her and give her some of your Sage advice. If it is not very sage if you do the best you can I dare say it will do her good & you no harm. I charge you to give my kind regards to Mrs. Harlow tell her I sincerely sympathize with her in her bereavement & that tho' many years have pass'd away her kindness and attention to me when a stranger are fresh in my memory & my son see that you are particularly attentive and kind to her possibly being a very old lady she may be childesh and ? on some things notwithstanding see to it that you always treat her with defference and almost fillial regard and whoever else in the family is neglected by you take care that she is not. you may perhaps wonder at my saying so much on this subject - but you will not if you live to be old. Young people are very prone to forget old people I think they do not generally know or realize a thousandth part of the inconvenience & distresses that old people suffer. I enjoin the duty upon you in this instance more particularly to cancel the obligation I feel for her goodness to me when I was about your age.\n\n   You say you shall be a farmer.   that the professions are very full etc.etc. nonsense & never mind - dont be discouraged this is a wide world we live in - aye and a great deal of ignorance and darkness to be dispeled by the light of knowledge and truth there are now a great many well educated amiable devotedly pious young men wanted yes! really needed now even in New England and ten times as many more in some other parts of our own Country to say nothing of the nations that sit in darkness & the shadow of death. And then think how greatly the number will be increased before you can become such an one- think of these things I say and go ahead  - climb a long what if the ascent be very steep and the Summit hid in the clouds every try and every step brings you a little nearer to it - besides if you should let go now even is nt it possible that you might fall so far as to dash your brains out\n  Look up my Dear boy & \"dig,, cheerfully on with all the helps you can get till you are five & twenty or so and then follow farming or any other \"honest\n\ncalling,, that you prefer and I shall be satisfied. but you'll say whats the use of latin & greek for a farmer - well! what if it is of no use but to learn you to \nclimb or dig (just which you choose to call it) I fully believe it wont be labour lost.\n\n   I am sorry you did not have a Cap in the first of the season you might have get you one C. could let you have a little more money enough to get your Books, but if you have not got one and think it is best to wait till Ann comes let me know and I will write to her to get one or you may write to her. I want to know when your vacation commences perhaps we can manage it so that Ann will arrive at Bangor just in time to come home when you do. how does the frock coat answer your purpose - if it is best for you to have a new Coat before winter it will be best to get the cloth if we can so as to have it cut out at Bangor before you come home & perhaps have it made here - if we send to have Ann get cloth for one we ought to write soon & I dont know what to do about it.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97678,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97678","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/1026e3d8a6ab8e82b0c0ddfcf4d6f06b.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/1026e3d8a6ab8e82b0c0ddfcf4d6f06b.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/1026e3d8a6ab8e82b0c0ddfcf4d6f06b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1026e3d8a6ab8e82b0c0ddfcf4d6f06b.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:13:20+00:00","modified":"2020-07-30T18:38:46+00:00","filename":"1026e3d8a6ab8e82b0c0ddfcf4d6f06b.jpg","authentication":"a655d3631a701896a1751de00d64e718","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_74_005_001_o2.jpg","size":1270308,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2156,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.054555246340961},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180619"],"TimeCreated":["034907"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180619"],"TimeCreated":["034907"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180619"],"TimeCreated":["034907"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1026e3d8a6ab8e82b0c0ddfcf4d6f06b.jpg","FileDateTime":1587316296,"FileSize":1270308,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2156\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2156,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:19 16:10:04","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:19 03:49:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:19 03:49:07","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3058,"ExifImageLength":5106,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1234,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1234","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Milo July 8th 1839\n\nDear Brother - Although it will be considerable of a spell before I shall want to send another letter to you, I will begin now. July 5, we set out to pile over east & engaged several men but only Henry Sargent came. We had made but 3 piles when it rained so that we had to go home.\n\n   The next forenoon we worked on the road & in the afternoon commenced hoeing the potatoes. N. & W. from the barn with Austin Nye to work for us. We had got them ploughed & a few rows hoed when it rained & we had to quit.\nThis morning Charles mowed the grass on the side hill below the house intending to cut 2 crops. We have been hoeing potatoes today, got 52 rows done N.W. from the barn & all those at the upper end of the interval. We put plaster on part of  them. 9th Today E.E. & I have been hauling off brands etc. over cast with Kate getting ready to plough that which was piled last year. 10th Piling over East. Oliver O. Davis, True Stubbs, John Ellis & O.O. Davis' oxen helped us today. Stubbs has had the waggon, Davis 24 bu. potatoes, & Ellis 10 bu. potatoes & are paying. Have you recieved my last letter per John Hodgkins. \n\n12th you have, you have I know, for I just got a letters from you to that effect, per great hobb go who also brought us a barrell sent by Mr. Moses an innkeeper near Bangor towards what he owes Chas. Such an arrival causes much joy here we eat Jonny cake so long! I am glad to see such a \"good long letter\" from you a moi. I wish you much joy of your garden so nice & so cute. \"How you'll  (not) sail in our boat 31 days from this time.\" Oh! You write how you think you have not rec'd 1 of my letters. I fear it is too true. I sent 1 by Mr. Thos. Sargent. In it was a mention of sending it by Arnold Sargent- it was to be left & Chas. & H. who came & got our waggon. Did you ever get it? Hereafter I mean to keep an acct. of all the letters which I send. Pardon my mistake in dating the letter per D. Doe June 1st instead of July 1st. What quantity of fun did you have upon \"the glorius 4th\u00a0! Hurra for Old Pushaw. Should you not have done better, so remained and seen the city celebration? You ought to have carried some dinner. Save your 6 1\/4  cts. of fishhooks so use here at home.\n[top of page] You say \"why dont you fill up a letter as I do?\" You seem to have a particular faculty of filling up a sheet of paper chock full of nothing.

I beg your pardon for the ill language in my last.\n\nYou can be accommodated in regard to the E. C. Barnes letters etc. when you come home *  Yesterday morn. a severe thunder shower occurred & the following rain prevented us from breaking up over E. as we had calculated. We took the plough over ready for the morrow. This morning I was dispatched over to O.O.Davis to warn him to appear armed & equipped as the law directs with a valiant yoke of oxen to help break up. We had Col. J. Lee's also. We did not begin very early & had not gone round but 5 or 6 time ere the rain in torrents poured & we had to quit. We ploughed in the afternoon a lot. The feed is very good in our East pasture. We pasture our 3 horses, 3 cows, 3 bulls, Mr. Ellis' 2 cows & 2 year old heifer. There is feed for Several more. We rec'd a letter from Lucy last night. All's well.\n\nSaturday 13th We ploughed with O.O. Davis & oxen etc. G. Whidden oxen got along pretty well. There is so much grass etc. ploughed. There is considerable excitement caused by the return of Mr. Lindsey of whose mysterious disappearance 3 yrs ago you have probably heard. He says, he has been traveling in Texas & the Western states & those believe his stories who choose. He was seen in Holton last winter. Wed. 17th. Last Monday we ploughed over E. - had Mr. Davis' & your Uncle Jim's oxen with Mr. Bingleton to drive. Eliab cleared plough & I hoed. Tuesday, We all, Mr. Ellis also on our acct. hands worked for Mr. Bingleton in the forenoon ho'en potatoes & in the afternoon rigged a breaking up team with as follows, Davis' & Whidden's oxen, Billington to drive, Ellis to hold, Eliab to clear, while Charles & I were hoeing etc. Today we go it pretty strong.

your cloth was designed for a dress coat as I thought you would need that most next summer but you can have it made which way you like best provided you have cloth enough.

I will begin like a bear in November & end (if convenient) like a lamb in May. I want to join you because you will always direct your letters to I.M. Metcalf, instead of J.M. Metcalf.

It was so fixt that Mr. Mitchell thought it was for him (I dont know how he happened to get it), it was directed I. instead of J. M. Metcalf & the Metcalf was not written very plain so it was taken to stand for Ichabod M. Mitchell. Well - after it had been there a good while they sent it along as far as to Mr. Hill's, and they did not tell if it nor send it down for a good whole (not having all read it I presume). However antiquated its contents were they were not stale I assure you.

Charles has been threshing & carrying to mill a bushel of wheat today. Eliab & I have been digging chenangoes. We have dug about 2\/5 bushels besides the small ones.

In tracing the dealings of God in his providence towards us how much reason we have for thankfulness - how many fashionable circumstances attend your situation there in spite of some little trials and how thankful we ought to be that just as we were perplexing ourselves what to do for Joseph this winter, such a chance should come up so unexpected for him,","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97688,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97688","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/aa86d33b7681d61095aa1d84224b24eb.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/aa86d33b7681d61095aa1d84224b24eb.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/aa86d33b7681d61095aa1d84224b24eb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/aa86d33b7681d61095aa1d84224b24eb.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:13:33+00:00","modified":"2020-07-31T19:49:22+00:00","filename":"aa86d33b7681d61095aa1d84224b24eb.jpg","authentication":"7f54adf48be1e0150d8f40523315e057","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_74_008_001_o2.jpg","size":1421318,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2859,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046031311129247},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180619"],"TimeCreated":["035051"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180619"],"TimeCreated":["035051"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180619"],"TimeCreated":["035051"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"aa86d33b7681d61095aa1d84224b24eb.jpg","FileDateTime":1587316297,"FileSize":1421318,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2859\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2859,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:19 16:10:32","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:19 03:50:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:19 03:50:51","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3115,"ExifImageLength":3922,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1234,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1234","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Thurs.

With the avails buy a pair of laced shoes (half high boots) for Eliab according to the measure sent. The cloth is for pantaloon and jacket, both of which you are to get cut, and the pantaloons made, the jacket Mother will get made here and you can send it with the box, shoes so on- bring them when you come: Charles expects to go down soon and probably will contrive it so as to go about the time your vacation begins which I suppose will be in about a fortnight. If you can well get along without pants till your vacation, you may only get them cut, but if you really need them before you can get them made.\n My Dear Son, I do not get much time to write to you lately but I do not think of you the less. I trust you are a good boy & I suppose you are getting along just as well as if I was plying you with my most \"Sapient advice,,\n We shall expect you home the 7th of Dec. and if we can make all things come right will endeavour that Charles or Eliab will be there to bring you home but if they dont you can risk it I suppose in a day if the days are short.

is wrong to indulge the wish or at least to seek to gratify it to have my children have the advantages of education with no more means at command to accomplish it. I hope it is not from an ambitious motive but that they may be more virtuous useful and happy how ever that may be I think I have a sincere desire to feel an entire submission to the will of God respecting it - but that bears very little weight on my mind in comparison with thier conversion. My anxiety for you Dear Isaac has been so great especially since I heard of the revival at B. that it has sometimes amounted to an agony of distress that I could hardly mind my work - but I have been brought to feel more submissive and to enquire  why? why?  I feel so much more for you than other person who out of the orb of safety your soul is of no more value than theirs and God will be glorified if not in your salvation he will in your destruction - but O my son think on eternity fix your thought upon it till you feel its weight try to measure it compare it with this little inch of time endeavour to realise it as you will when \"time with you shall be no more,, then think of the value of your soul and O think of the sacrifice Eternal love has made think of the unspeakable gift do - do my son be persuaded to attend to the concerns of your soul now when will you ever have a better time will it be easier for you to seek religion when you have longer rejected and Despise'd the offer'd mercy. Listen O listen my son to the still small voice beware that you grieve not the Holy Spirit of God\n\n[left hand side] I am most sorry you lent \"Bunyan\" to Ellen for the Keens have it and injur'd it very much. I'm afraid you scolded Joseph to much he doubtless had Almeda's concurrence I think her some to blame perhaps we shall all feel ?free when we know all about it. I am very much afraid A. will get sick trying to do without any help.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97692,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97692","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/193b601141ca37249d6fa7997f159fb9.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/193b601141ca37249d6fa7997f159fb9.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/193b601141ca37249d6fa7997f159fb9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/193b601141ca37249d6fa7997f159fb9.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:13:39+00:00","modified":"2020-08-01T02:38:14+00:00","filename":"193b601141ca37249d6fa7997f159fb9.jpg","authentication":"ec976f50475da705c426393b103c9709","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_74_009_002_o2.jpg","size":1454078,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2869,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046928146340834},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180619"],"TimeCreated":["035124"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180619"],"TimeCreated":["035124"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180619"],"TimeCreated":["035124"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"193b601141ca37249d6fa7997f159fb9.jpg","FileDateTime":1587316297,"FileSize":1454078,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2869\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2869,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:19 16:10:43","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:19 03:51:24","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:19 03:51:24","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3118,"ExifImageLength":3912,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1234,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1234","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Saturday Eve\n\n               I think the plan you mention my Daughter would be a very good one if you can only make it work and if that will not go I dont know but it would be best to get a chance and let Isaac come and work this summer if would not put him back more than the time about his studies.  he could go in to school again the fall term but he would have to go into a new class & dont know how it would do Charles & I have all along thought it would be best for him to attend that school till August if he any way can if Mr. W. \"breaks up,, perhaps he could get another place.

the extreme cold last week- was not you very cold before you got there how do you like your place and employment? Did you call on Mr. P. what did you say to him and what did he tell you. You will of course try to be a good boy & do your duty in every respect toward Mrs. Parker and her family endeavor to be cheerful and pleasant constantly - I advise you to make a confidant of Mrs. Parker  I know or think I know that she is a kind hearted Christian woman therefore tell her your feelings and troubles if you any and write to me all you feel and think - be earnest and engaged in trying to benefit yourself -now is your time for improvement. I charge you my Dear boy not to neglect reading the Bible and prayer consider that your Safeguard your talisman I want you should attend the sabbath school constantly  and endeavor to get your lessons and understand them well and pay good attention and try to profit by the sermons you hear. Remember you are hearing and learning in action for Eternity and not think to much about what your fellow creatures will think of you - probably very few will notice you at all  and tis of very little consequence what those few think of you compared with the approbation of God and of your own conscience\n  You know and believe that \"one thing is needful,, be often at the throne of Grace God is equally accessable to the humble praying Soul from every place and though we are seperated for a time may our prayers often assend together to that God whose ear is always open to the petitions of the humble penetent - let your first thought in the morning be towards God in praise and prayer for direction and Guidance through the day. 27th I expected a letter from you last week. I hope you have one all ready to send by Mr. Forrest Turner who will carry this - if you have not done it I want you should get your patern for a jacket and send it by him. I shall try to have him call at Mrs. Parkers as he goes in tomorrow and as he returns the next day. I shall send you 2 pr Stockings, you Grammar & if you should want any other book that we have here write & I'll send them Have you bought any Books? what do you study? how do you get along? but in the first place what school do you go to? your Masters name? No. of scholars etc? Do you have any time to study evenings? Furnish yourself with books but be as economical about it as you can with propriety perhaps you can very consistently borrow some you can ask Mrs. Parker (or Mr. Pomeroy) and suffer yourself to be retarded in your studies for wont of books Do be diligent and try to be expeditious in all you do and you'll get the more time for study\n\nwrite write write  particularly                                                               from your affectionate mother\nkeep a journal                                                                                         A.

week at home after your school closes, but perhaps it is not best I very much approve of your plan about coming home. C. would go down after you if we had a good horse and sleigh possibly he may hire one if you think it best Could'nt you coax somebody there to offer you one or if you could leave thursday noon you could come with Cutts. I want you should come next week which will be about the middle of Feb. because if you put it off till the next week I am afraid something will happen to prevent. I hope you'll have a better visit than before but perhaps it is not best to expect it, & what if we dont ever have things just as we could wish 'tis but for a short time and if we could always feel that this state of existence is only a little space allotted us to prepare to live and be willing to wait for all our glory honour happiness and rest till we pass these narrow bounds wouldn't it be better for us - you'll say that my practice dont agree to it but I believe I dont in reality feel so much vex'd at vexatious things as I appear to. I haven't any cloth but we must get some and you must have at least 2 pr of shirts made up to carry with you.\nThursday 6th I wanted to send this to you yesterday but I couldn't & dont know when I can have a chance I heard that Mr. Dolen is going down to his son sometime soon perhaps I can send the bundle by him but the time is short only three weeks after this & the weeks are dreadful short nowadays. I'm so afraid you'll miss of comeing home and that we shall not get your things ready i.e. do what little we can to them.\nif you dont find out some other opportunity wouldn't it be best for you to dismiss your school thursday noon & make up one day of the time next saturday & the saturday after your term & if you close the school one day short of the time they wont come perhaps- if you have anything to make or any work you want done fetch it along.

I have been twisting stocking yarn etc. & my hand trembles so I can hardly write. We have had a great deal of stormy but very little cold weather this winter; though the Mercury was 31 below Zero last Tuesday morn. I walk from home in pleasant weather & good walking, - otherwise I stop at Mr. Lee's. Our Scholars do wonders for beginning, at writing Themes, and very well at Declamations. May Furber & Some of the good people are thinking of a plan whereby to keep up an interest in the Temperance Cause, and make the meetings interesting, - Viz. to have certain persons who are so disposed, write pieces to be read in the meetings - some after the similitude of our Foxcroft Philomathian Society. Don't you think it is a good plan. I wish you could be here to read them sometimes. We have no very good readers.\n\n   We had a real feast the other night - three good long letters from you, & one from Ann, which she sent by Mrs. Dennett. Your advice to Joseph is just what he needs, if he would only think so, and perhaps it may do him some good, though he would not, of course, acknowledge it, you know. I forewarn you that you may expect something pretty severe from him, ere long.\n           He maintains that is is a great injury to a girl to go into society & \"learn how to behave\" as tis called. If he was looking for a wife, he would prefer one who was entirely unsophisticated as he says.

Joseph is not quite so dutiful in that respect but I trust it is not from any want of affection - he is not very bad about it - I dont know what Eliab will be I feel a great deal of anxiety about him.   Mr. Walter Brown wrote a letter to Charles expressing a wish to employ him in his store & if they both like stay as he express it till he could get a thorough Mercantile education Ann was very much pleas'd with the idea Charles thought it might be a good chance and E. seem'd inclin'd to go I said not much against it tho' I had & have some misgivings. He hurried right away for fear he should lose the chance has been there now a fortnight - he wrote a hasty line home saying only that he guess'd it was a good place - that he would give him 30 or 40 dollars this year & 20 or 25 dollars a month next yr I wrote to him not to conclude any bargain till C. goes down. I have felt rather a new sensation of loneliness since E. went away to have you young ones all gone baby and all you have all been absent occasionally but when I reflect that perhaps he nor you nor Joseph will be at home as you us'd to except now and then a while it makes me feel sad and lonely. O let us all pray and strive that we may be a whole family transplanted in due time to that better home and endless life where we may increase in virtue holiness and happiness no more to be seperated forever I want you should write to Eliab he is a good clever boy but he has been flatter'd and had his own & has \"sorter,, slid out from under the restraint salutary and perhaps absolutely necessary for boys of his age - he is in danger of being a light superficial character if nothing worse - he want be more easily led away than Joseph at his age - Jo went to Foxcroft  the next week after he had done his school and I have hardly heard from him since I suppose he cant spare time. I never saw but one person do parsimonious of time that was your father & I dont know as he was. C has not done much on the house, expects Gelman in 2 or 3 weeks he could not come before because his family were not well C. has hir'd a man for six months begins next week Hay is very scarce about here hardly any body got any to sell I guess. C's and J's will sell for $10 a ton - you say you wont pay the the last year term Bill  take care and ascertain what is best to do before you act rashly you must not be guided much by our opinion because\n[written in between lines of above upside down] 22nd have had a letter from Eliab yesterday he likes very well says Mr. B. will give him $75 dollars to stay one year we have had 2 or 3 since this month come in the feild are only partially have now ice is not gone out of the river but it has been very warm yesterday and today one of C. oxen is very lame has been for six or 7 weeks (old swan), he think, he wont do to work any more but will do for Beef in the fall. The Mill folks have got in quite a fuss about roads and ferrys they have built a new boat at Jackson Ferry Niles Carver is continuing to buy the Boat and Monopolize the ferry (Mr. Cutts was talking here today, he says that to prevent it they mean to prevent this ferry being discontinued and push through the diagonal road now Charles & uncle Henry can crow Mr. Kittredge ? has become very unpopular cheifly in consequence of building this inner road says he's very sorry. Would rather give twice as much to build the other. Mrs. Kitredge has got a pair of twin boys 6 weeks old. Aron Hill a pr of twins too neither of them living Daniel Holman will be here today on his way to Bangor to seek his fortune says he thinks of trying to get an education I am afraid he is not aware of the difficulties that are in his way not having early advantages etc. however if he cant get along with it he can stop you know. Surely if he can get a liberal education by his own exertions you need despair. I rather think that Joseph has come to the conclusion that he shall not get his living by the labor of his hands, exactly. The newspapers you sent come safe to hand try it again. write a good long letter to Eliab soon as you can.\nOur village is increasing very fast in business and the number of its inhabitant but it is a dreadful profane and wicked place.  I am very sorry I made such coarse homely shirts for you do save them for winter and if I can get some cloth I mean to make some fine ones and have them ready to send to you if I have a chance if not they'll be ready when you come do write often and very particularly all you do and say and think and feel. Pray for me think often how short this life is how vast the souls affairs and above all live near to God. I have sometimes had had a little doubt whether it was best for you to go to B. but certainly you have every inducement to persevere much and difficulties are not without their use if they are met manfully be strong if you find you cant get along any other way couldn't you leave at commencement and earn money till spring.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97707,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97707","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/75f3380d05f53dd6d6e436b3f08aa447.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/75f3380d05f53dd6d6e436b3f08aa447.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/75f3380d05f53dd6d6e436b3f08aa447.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/75f3380d05f53dd6d6e436b3f08aa447.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:13:59+00:00","modified":"2020-08-02T03:37:54+00:00","filename":"75f3380d05f53dd6d6e436b3f08aa447.jpg","authentication":"92e0aa04b2479138abf8c6a528363675","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_76_003_002_o2.jpg","size":1630324,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2939,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051363023452169},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["225719"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["225719"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["225719"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"75f3380d05f53dd6d6e436b3f08aa447.jpg","FileDateTime":1587316298,"FileSize":1630324,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2939\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2939,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:27 13:15:38","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:26 22:57:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:26 22:57:19","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":37,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3218,"ExifImageLength":3941,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1234,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1234","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"we are all very green on that subject it certainly dont seem right for you to pay it but it is sometime very hard getting along contrary to custom.

Brown) I suppose you did not get before you started for Boston - hope you had a good journey and a safe return hope you call'd on Mrs. Childs I do regret exceedingly that you could not have had some more money I am sure you must need a new coat very much indeed and many other things besides I hope you did borrow some i.e. if you could for it was such a good opportunity to purchase what you must here - I did very much hope that Charles would be able to send you some he has sold several little lots of Hay 1\/2 ton or less in a place but had only got money enough to pay Everetts demand (which was the remainder of Alfred Holmans wages). The Pubbcan is denying him by the way they will not remit your tax & C. has agreed to pay it. He means to sell both yoke of oxen in the fall and the Donkey. he has got his crops into the ground in good order & if they do well I do think that he will make out to \"wiggle out,, as Mother says those little Debts that have bother'd him by next fall and help you to some money besides. Our hir'd man is Samuel Hobbs he is a modest unabh? pleasant fellow, faithful and steady about his work but nit as dexterous quite as my boys I think Mr. Gilmans family have been sick his wife has had a babe and has lately buried it - we expect him here in a few days. Joseph borrow'd an old knapsack of Mo Bilington pack'd up a change of linnen in his \"notions,, and started of to seek his fortune [characteristic] May 21st. I have heard nothing from him since except that he was in Bangor on the 28th I am rather impatient to know what he is about - his original declamation examination day was thought much I dont know but it must have been better if he had taken the College course instead of you - you seem to talk that study is rather irksome to you at which I am surpris'd and at first could no way recount for it - but I have considered it and the reason appears obvious you did not when young discipline your mind as Joseph did he can fix his mind at will & for any length of time - you may perhaps recollect how many times we have warned you against so much desultory reading is it not reading to much now that unfits your mind for close study or is your health not good - you have perhaps tasked your mind to hard in some way or other - how would you enjoy yourself if depriv'd of Books, entirely for those months. 3rd Mr. Gilman has come here today we shall have the back room shed & piazza etc. done but I dont think he will stop now to finish the parlour & perhaps not the chambers\nEben Greenleaf has come to live with Mr. Lee has bought the farm I believe. Arnold Sargent's wife is dead. Lucy is going off tomorrow to teach the school that you did last winter. Mr. Pomroy you know is going to Europe. Ann has been spending 3 weeks at Bangor. We expect Mary B. Pomroy to board with us this summer and take lessons of Ann. Almeda gets along nicely with her affairs. C. has got one acre of Corn & one of potatos in the next past. of the north field very highly manur'd 3 acres of Oat that he thinks much of near the \"Cattact,, Swamp and I dont know how much on the uper end of the intervale and the upper lot some wheat & Oak & peas I believe he has done Almeda's plowing & sowing. I send you a pr of shirts not in very good condition for we have been very much \"driv,, fixing Joseph away and Lucy all of a sudden - we thought best not to be put linen bosom in the shirts lest they should not be right would have made a pr to send with them but had not time it grieves me sadly that I cannot send you some money - but trust in the Lord and do good and verily thou shalt be fed.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97711,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/97711","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/82ea2bce02cd7ba11503e156e82dd7ec.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/82ea2bce02cd7ba11503e156e82dd7ec.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/82ea2bce02cd7ba11503e156e82dd7ec.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/82ea2bce02cd7ba11503e156e82dd7ec.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:14:05+00:00","modified":"2020-08-03T03:07:38+00:00","filename":"82ea2bce02cd7ba11503e156e82dd7ec.jpg","authentication":"71d56a9658393ce40535bdc395ffc5ce","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_03_fl_76_004_003_o2.jpg","size":1558992,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2927,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049317086132939},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["225810"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["225810"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180626"],"TimeCreated":["225810"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 3"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"82ea2bce02cd7ba11503e156e82dd7ec.jpg","FileDateTime":1587316298,"FileSize":1558992,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2927\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2927,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:27 13:15:49","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:26 22:58:10","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:26 22:58:10","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":37,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3277,"ExifImageLength":4030,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1234,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1234","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Wednes.

I have one before me dated May 18th in which you express a dislike to study & seem to think you never was intended fr a literary character - that it was \" a dreadful bore,, reviewing studies etc. At which I was very much astonished & wish to know what it means I thought you had always been fond of what might be to me literary pursuits. Tho' I think you have never decipher'd your mind just right & you have not the faculty of fixing your mind so long on any one thing as Joseph can as you might if you had not atton'd yourself very much to your detriment in so much desultory reading always in which you tell about study being ? when you render your letters the ridiculous figure you cut some of the times not half dress'd. The possibility that you might turn out to be a lazy man struck through my heart like a barb'd arrow and actually made the tears flow at the bare thought of it to have ones fondest hopes completely crush'd!!! But I am persuaded better things of of you and things that accompany salvation tho' I thus speak, I am apprehensive that you sometime tax your mind quite to hard and then again (perhaps as the natural consequence) indulge yourself to much you act to much from impulse or feeling and not enough from a sense of duty you must try to govern yourself better I almost know you read to much - what infinite obligations we are under to praise and bless God for his Goodness to you how ungrateful we must be not to be faithful in duty. (had a letter from her last night, Lucy I suppose told you what they say about you and your school last winter.  The Dudley girls have not call'd upon her and do not hardly speak to her at meeting have been not only impolite but rude to her tis plan that they have tried very much to injure you I dont know why - was your deportment such when you were there that they think that you were trifling with them? I am much deciev'd if that is your character still you might unwittingly gave them reason to think so. I should think you might have seen enough of human nature by this time to know that where there is a family of seven at Marriageable daughters, there will be a great deal of Monouvering to catch a likely young fellow that happens to come in thier way and if they fail xxx look out you'll not always find all the virtue and excellence that were portray'd in the characters of females as you gave it to Joseph in a letter last winter. It is worth a great deal to any one to get a just climate of human nature we are very apt to view it better or worse than it really is. It seems  as if you ought to be able to keep a good school but greatly suppose you did not last winter exactly and I am sure I dont know what you can do to earn any thing hardly next fall, but be faithful to your duty & observe carefully the indications of providence & God will direct you what to do I cant think of anything about here Mr. Harvey is going to keep the fall & winter school in Brownville Village. Ezra Barker is engag'd to keep the school in this district they have a kind of high school 3 months every fall in Royalton which I suppose is profitable to the teachers and very haply there are teachers enough there but if you think it would best I can write to Mr. Perkins about it. We have been trying to contrive a way to help you to some money if you cant find anything better for you to do you can come home and work there is always enough to do you know we have talked about & I think C. will be willing to let you have the old oxen and make what you can out of them perhaps you could sell them better than he could if you should be about here he will have to have another man part of the time he has sow'd 50 bushels of grain 6 of it on Almeda's  the wheat looks pretty well but it has been very cold &

I dont see how you get along without a better coat and new cap - what did you do with your hat you said you couldn't carry it back with you but I suppose you did. If you mean to take a school next fall and winter (& dont see what else you can do) perhaps you had better stay at home till November and then go down east of here as your Chum about chances that way horribly Mr. Tash may want you to assist him but perhaps he could not afford to give wages enough. tis no harm to think these things all over and see what is best to try to do.

brother I intended to write you a good long letter in return for the ones I have not received from you but Mother and the rest have written about all the news and I do not feel in the mood for giving advice or for 'sentimentalities' and besides have but little time: About myself I can write nothing very encouraging. I suppose you have heard all about the Foxcroft business which truly resulted much to my satisfaction. I suppose too you know too that I spent three weeks at Mr. Pomroy's first before and after his departure & about the time Joseph went there - my going there at the time was rather accidental but as one consequence Mary P. spends the summer here and possibly another consequence may be my taking a private school at Bangor next fall, - there is a very good opening for one near the Baptist meeting house the chief obstacle in the way is the lack of a suitable room. I do not place much dependence upon it - am undetermined in case that should fail whether to go to Boston and strenuously try for a chance in that region or go to the far est with Mary Savage when she returns (she is expected with her husband this summer. Joseph has got into exactly the right spot at last, has he not?

have\n\n you have crack'd up your school so much about being easy, easy to govern that I am afraid you'll have something hard and disagreable before you get through\n  Dear Brother           \n                      Joseph wrote to you in all the confusion of a short visit at home with a good deal of work to do, and Mother and I put in a few words without hardly looking at what he had written, so we fear there will be a misunderstanding on your part, which may occasion you some anxiety of mind to say the least. We therefore write another letter sooner than we otherwise should. Everything goes on here as it used to. We plod along day after day, through the same round of cares & labors. Our potatoes, & indeed all about here, are almost worthless, so Charles does not dig all his. He raised a little corn, quite a lot of beans, & pumpkins & considerable many Oats. He has no one to help him now. He ploughs some, some he fats his hogs on pumpkins & Oatmeal, and some he cogitates & lays \"plans\" as usual, big with expediency & future profit for the whole family. Mother & I do the work, \"cut Pumpkin\" etc. and take care of our little Jane Rogers. Almeida takes care of her household as usual & runs down here two or three times a day for advice etc. Thus passes each day. Nothing new. In the evening we gather round the old stove & talk, work, read, or eat apples, \"as the case may be.\" Good times after all, but it would enliven the scene in no small degree could one of the loved \"absent ones\" drop in and spend a season with us occasionally. Our hearts have been this gladdened by a short visit from the Bangor brethren, but we have no expectation of enjoying\n\n[ upside down between lines of the above] Nov. 2 I am afraid Joseph does not feel quite right towards Charles & it is a trial to me. C refus'd to give him for his work last fall partly because he had determin'd that he would continue to get along without giving any notes and partly because he thought he asked to high a price for his work C has all along determin'd to pay him as soon as he could sell the oxen but was not quite willing to give him note. Joseph has 8 or 9 sheep which he wants to sell or let & Charles wanted to buy & would pay next june with the wool or would take them but J says he wont have any dealings etc. He left his watch with Billington to sell and give him a fair chance to make five dollars on it. I am sorry he feels so for tho' Charles may have done wrong some times, I think in general he has been as good a son and Brother considering all circumstances at any rate he has had a great many & severe trials & has had to practice a great deal of self Denial - & frequently really good intentions owing to adverse circumstances have mistaken and set down against him - and possibly his disposition may not be quite as aimiable as it would have been if he had had less perplexity and embarrasment  Dont be alarmed now and think there is any difficulty for there is not much not any perhaps that they are aware of but let us all pray and try that there may be perfect union and kind feeling among us all C thinks J close and unfeeling more perhaps than he ought to you have been as good boy about writing your feelings cares etc. but yet I want to know a great deal more particularly about you.\n\n I dont know but this would be a good place for a tavern we have had more travellers

Charles has now six animals of the hog kind. Two old black ones, quite fat, most ready to kill, two last Summer ones & 2 little ones, about six weeks old. He thinks as Potatos are so scarce,  few will keep Swine and consequently they will be high in the Spring, & as he has Oats & Peas, can do well by having them to sell in the Spring.\n\n  We have had four cows this Summer. Mother thinks she has sold some two hundred weight of butter. C. hopes to do great things with 6 or 8 cows, next Summer.\n  Ezra Barker is teaching a High School at the Mills, Has 23 scholars. He spent an evening here while Joseph was at home. Teaches at the corner this winter. I did think of going but as he knows little of French, I shall study at home what I can & try to get a School by & by. I have bought Joseph's Dictionaire Francais & intend to use it. Wish I had him again to teach me. Should like to get through Algebra Colburn too, but dont suppose I can alone. We have a Writing School taught by one Wing, a Kenebecker, a one-armed man. Mr. Thax will commence one soon. Edwin Snow has engaged the Mill school. Is he a good teacher? One Mr. Pritchard, Agent for the Mutual Insurance Com. has been here lately from Bangor. Several got insured. Charles did not. Elder Rowell has been hired to preach here 1\/4 of the time for a year. Nathan Sargent subscribed five dolls! People generally dislike Mr. Sewall very much.

Well, he left the money with Macomber, who forever blabbing you know, must needs tell every body who came into his store, of the important trust reposed in him, and Everett among the number,  who forthwith trusted him, as Macomber reported that the money was deposited there for Charles, whereas Rider says he distinctly stated that the money was for Joseph. Charles explained to Everett, but to no purpose; he insisted on a trick? before Esq. Kittredge, which was accordingly held, whereat there was a flat contradiction between Macomber & Rider. The former maintaining that Rider said the money was left for Charles; and the latter as strongly that he stated it was for Joseph. Billington and others were knowing to the bargain bettween Rider & Joseph, and Mr. Kittredge decided in Charles' favor, whereat Everett appealed to the March court at Dover!

Charles return'd Friday almost froze his face. Today he is gone down the River with the rest of his Oats I dont expect he will get as much for them as he could about here by & by for there are a great many about here who want to buy to Sow. But he was under a necessity of selling for money to pay taxes, - Bradford for Leather - & for Horse Harn. etc.  He expect they will be high but he will not have much if any to sell for he had such bad time about getting it a considerable part of it was damag'd and some of it was not cut at all - he was sick you know and could not help when he wanted it for love or money.

Went down town in the morning, bought some of Town's Spellingbook which I have decided to introduce in to School: paid my bill at White's which amounted after deducting tuition to $5,44: I left a note pinned on Mr. Hardy's door, stating I would be there at 2 o'clock to take a lesson in painting if convenient for him. At recess, the girls told me, that the water in the 'stream' had risen so that it carried off the upper bridge and that it feared the two others would go the next high tide. A freshet has been feared for some days, on account of the vast quantities of ice above Oldtown and the ice so strong in the narrows below High head. Oldtown bridge had already gone and Basin Mills at Stillwater. The water at Rose place surrounded that building so that large trees in the front yard, looked like shrubs, and Mr. Theodore Brown's house a few roads off on the other side of the street - could only be approached by boats, he himself was moved out that afternoon on a bier or litter, & they were getting the furniture out in boats: he had been deranged most of the time the last week or two, and it is thought can not survive long. A great many people walked up to the Rose place to see the spectacle, but the next day we all could see a much greater\nupside down written between lines of the above the delapided buildings, broken sidewalks, rueful faces, lime stacked and strewed over the streets- the whole of Main Street filled with boards rafted up there for safety. Fenno lost all his books, so did Lewis, Stuckney dry goods all wet- most got their goods up stairs. Mr. Jewell lost three or 4 thousand dolls, in corn and flour: J. Fish all his property: 50 thousand dolls. Goss and Upham's store house was carried off with its pork, corn, flour etc. Ladd lost 5000 dolls, all his property, great hills of ice are left on the wharves that people say can not melt away till Aug. The water fell as much as 10 feet in five minutes when it went all the bridges have gone, the new market, 14 o 15 sawmills, more than twenty buildings along on the river, many poor people turned out of doors: Lucy, where you and I sat at Antislavery Circle, was under water, the families had to run out of their houses in the middle of the night, boards are laid across the bridge so we can go over on foot.\n[left-hand side] seven at night the whole jam came down from Oldtown broke a passage through the narrows to the ocean. The toll bridge sailed off majestically on the ice, & mills of Corporation owned by John Fish worth fifty thousand dollars insured? for 15 thousand.

I have been tryingunderlined to prepare a composition, also writing to Ann about some book etc. to day; rather worldly employment to be sure, but I am hurried, there is great scrabble, in school now about review and preparation for examinations?  There is one thing which I want a little advice about.  I expect that James ? Walker would be very glad of an invite to go up to Milo? with me and make hay a spell.  Now the thing is would it do?  considering etc.  He would have the tactunderlined to see whether he wanted I spose, but I think he would like to come if he were urged a little.  I should not have written now except for this, as I wrote so lately  Somehow I thought Charles did not look quite so well, healthy, as usual, when he was down here.  Is his health good now? I did not have a chance to see or speak to him, hardly at all, I don't know whether he noticed me in morning, or not, I was up to the farm with Mr. W. and James, hoeing potatoes; but he took the Centre St. so I could not speak to him.  I have not hardly concluded yet, whether to run home and to to haying before school is finished or stay and take the consequences at the Examination. I have been trying to hammer out a composition for a about a week.  As I had nothing to write about and nothing to write about I could not make out much.  I have been trying to ? patch up something, by taking a peice out one book and a slice out of another, a line here and a sentence there, twisting it every way, but I fear they will convict me of

afternoon\n\nDear Mother\nI got here in good time about three o clock found Mrs. W without any girl, a new one came Monday Morn;\u00a0; James W. is coming here in a week or two, to help tear down the house, and a carpenter is coming too, by and by!  The girl is quite young (note the good old one who cannot come yet) and without exactly asking I have found out that Mrs. W would not want any addition to the family but I think Lucy had better come and board at Mr. Cutlers, they would probably board here a little cheaper if she did her own washing and perhaps might pay part in produce at his store and C. take the money instead.  She would learn as much there about behavior company as here, and with regarding to introducing her time out of school, she must learn to have decision of character and independence enough to do what is right and proper without being led by others; a most useful lesson and one that can be gained best by experience.  I should have gone on up to Mr. Cutler's this afternoon if it had just raised, but there is not doubt but they will take her and she must get ready as soon as she can.  I shall send word as soon as I have been there and she had better come as soon as possible afterward, so as to be here as near the beginning of the term as she can.  Well, what kind of a school will she go to?  Why, the committee who came in yesterday, called it a new select school for girls, in telling the scholars (and teacher too I suppose) how much they expected of them.  It consists of 44 girls, from 10 to 15 mostly, no boys, so you see it is just the school for Lucy and if she comes with a determination to study she can improve much and be a help to me.  I should rather she would go to Mr. Pomroy' meeting and perhaps I can arrange it so as to have her in our S.S in that case she would attending meeting here in the forenoon, though that meeting is as good as this.\n\n I want my thick shoes to work in the garden with.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101724,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101724","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/679dfea4381b6264fc3b736c8ce729f0.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/679dfea4381b6264fc3b736c8ce729f0.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/679dfea4381b6264fc3b736c8ce729f0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/679dfea4381b6264fc3b736c8ce729f0.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:34:47+00:00","modified":"2020-07-27T01:27:40+00:00","filename":"679dfea4381b6264fc3b736c8ce729f0.jpg","authentication":"e262d0279efd64c5a712ece0bf5f5141","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_156_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1627956,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2858,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.052742010730114},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034006"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034006"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034006"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"679dfea4381b6264fc3b736c8ce729f0.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947663,"FileSize":1627956,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2858\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2858,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:48:17","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:40:06","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:40:06","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"SubSecTimeOriginal":18,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3063,"ExifImageLength":3857,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Bangor  Wed. 22nd 1840P.M\n\nDear Mother\nYou know how Ann all last term kept thinking as how she had a bad school to manage, and did not get along well; the committee were not satisfied, did not have a good examination and all that.  I said that she did nicely.  How did it turn out?  This term she has got, I suppose the very best school, taught by a female in the city!!  A New Select School!!! consisting of girls only; just about the right number; just about the right age; and moreover, just the very place for Lucy!!!!!  The next thing is, I suppose, for Lucy to get here as soon as possible.  It seems as if you would need her at home this Summer, but I think it is altogether too good a chance to be lost, or found every day either, especially if she can get boarded at Mrs Cutlers for 7\/6 per week.  Can't you get little Olive again this Summer?  It is a pity that Charles cannot improve this nice early spring, so as to get his crops in good season, and for once in the May, get fairly beforehand.  He ought to have had some of his wheat sown before this rain today: but I suppose he has not.  I fear he will conclude that his 6 days time and fuss spent for 10, dollars worth of hayseed, that he wanted to sow himself, was mmmm, not quite wasted, - but this applied.  It is so dark that I can write no longer.\nI have sold the smallest box of butter for 14 cts per pound, 12 quarter pound $1,71 I have enquired somewhat, but do not think I shall be able to sell the seeds.  It is too late, every body has got a full stock, more than they can sell; it is possible that I could sell them for money I would take pay out of the store, not ((unclear)).\nI was pretty lucky in selling the butter at 14 even I think; they were selling good butter out of the stores at 12 and 13, but one morn Almer Taylor who appeased to be a connoisseur, bring a little for his own family, took it home to use, but did not want the large box. 2 pounds was enough.  Perhaps I can sell some of the seed, as may as he want to sow, off to Mr. Walker, he has got all his seeds & garden to buy.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101725,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101725","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:34:48+00:00","modified":"2020-07-27T01:27:40+00:00","filename":"36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg","authentication":"b15255d7b4a327beb37a75aec862e71c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_156_001_003_o2.jpg","size":1495564,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2887,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047966106043695},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034012"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034012"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034012"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947663,"FileSize":1495564,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2887\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2887,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:48:19","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:40:12","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:40:12","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3107,"ExifImageLength":3874,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"There is a class beginning French this term, or going to, I wish I could study with them, but I don't hardly know whether I should have time.

PM the end things leaped off not so bad as they might be although Lucy felt dreadfully about it at first.\nWe went up to Brownville to meeting & finally came back Sabbath eve, as there was prospect of a storm in the morning.  I expect Lucy was a little too smart about her Thanksgiving washing bc, 'overdid' & took cold.  Dr, Kimball came & prescribed Calomel!!  However she was much better Sunday & I guess was only a Cold & Rheumatism, and she will get over it in few days.  Charles has not done much upon the house yet.  But Mr Gilman is coming to keep him soon.  Almer Butler has been threshing:  the grain turns out most miserably.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101734,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101734","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/35770a85ce1100f0eb664f297a46b0a9.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/35770a85ce1100f0eb664f297a46b0a9.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/35770a85ce1100f0eb664f297a46b0a9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/35770a85ce1100f0eb664f297a46b0a9.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:35:00+00:00","modified":"2020-07-27T01:27:40+00:00","filename":"35770a85ce1100f0eb664f297a46b0a9.jpg","authentication":"9347f0c74fc9d0b08e6a3311832a9881","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_156_004_003_o2.jpg","size":1593209,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2871,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051382567694828},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034101"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034101"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034101"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"35770a85ce1100f0eb664f297a46b0a9.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947664,"FileSize":1593209,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2871\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2871,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:48:40","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:41:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:41:01","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"SubSecTimeOriginal":54,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3167,"ExifImageLength":3971,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Joseph is getting along pretty well in his school I\nbelieve.

I laugh at him some for pursuing a College course so far before he has concluded whether to go or not.  If he is not going he had better do something else.  We may not write again before you come home & about getting anything if there is any way to get them - you know what we need I suppose.

Things get along about as usual, and I have just got fairly settled down to my studies again, after my weeks absence, some called it running away\nhere.  Four new scholars entered the school while I was gone,  Anna Hutchins of Industry, who was here last fall; and there young men from Charleston, who\nleft here for some reason suddenly, right in the middle of the term.  They were, I should think their three best scholars there, nearly fitted for College, I think of going to Brunswick this fall.  I guess they are really first rate fellows & good scholars.  Isaac W. Case, Dr Case's son of Havant, James K. Bartlett of Harmony and ((unclear)) who was in Milo a year ago.  B.B Sinart, I believe.

Mother and Brothers & Sisters;\nI am here quietly sealed in my room sabbath day after meeting, and, as I have not before, perhaps it will be no harm to write a letter home.  Today.\nI suppose you are all wishing to hear, all how I got here,\nhow I like, & how I get along.  To begin at the beginning Eliab can  tell how we got to Bangor, & I should like \nto hear from him how he got back.  I don't know as it was right for him to go home so into the sabbath.  What\ntime did he arrive?  (How does Josephs coat suit.)  You know he can send it back.\nI hope Eliab did not get it injured in the rain.

 Sat, May 3rd, 1845\n Dear Mother\n\nI received your last excellent letter a little more than a week ago, week yesterday.  I guess I wrote a long letter the next day, and directed it to Joseph at Foxcroft.  I intended to write another great 'yaller one' this week, and direct to Eliab at Bangor, but I have been rather busy lately, and commence late.  I shall have a chance to send to Bangor, first of next week, by Thomas H. Rich one of our Bangor students who is going home at that time.  So I will try and improved the opportunity by sending some letters to Eliab and he may find such meaning of correspondence he chooses, I can from there to Milo for them.  by the way, vacation commenced a fortnight from next Thursday, being after the third Wed. of May; or May 22nd.  Thence Vacation is two weeks or until June 5th, normally, recitations commence 9th.\nNow if you want to send letters or anything to me at about that time, just bear it in mind.  I tell you while I happen to think of it!  that you can send anything to Eliab & he give it to Edwin L.

some letter comparison, no matter what.  Like the countenance of a friend, perhaps better yet, like a letter from home.\nThe letters were well filled with a variety of news and interesting matter, and I am very much obliged to you all therefore, and hope you will all\ncontinue to do as well in writing.  I was intending to write about a couple of letters in answer to yours, but as I happened to have some of this sort \nof paper I bethought me of writing a letter on a sheet of it, partly for the sport of it, and party for a spite upon Uncle Sam, whom I should like\nto cheat out of $500,00 if I could only do it honourably, out of the Post Office Department, before July.\nBy the way I intended to have carried up some paper like this to Milo, when I was there on purpose for you to write letters to me upon.\nI am getting on here just after the old sort about;  Have got my studies pretty much made up, except the Greek at least.  My Chum is the 'same old coon.'\nsteady, industrious, studious, except poor fellow, the past  week he has got to reading Novels and really seems to have no kind of \ncommand over himself.  It is indeed a most terrible temptation to a person who has the taste already formed within him.\nTo be so surrounded with  them in every tempting form, every library, all kinds, & all authors really requires considerable self command not to be drawn into them\nand do nothing else but read novels from one weeks end to another.  Chum will have a fit, get drunk, he calls it, and read novels day & night almost, hardly\ngetting his lessons at all for two or three days, or a week, and then for the reaction read no more such, but confine himself to the digest metaphysics or \nsomething for a long time.\nYou have said a good deal to me about not having any command over myself in such things, but I believe the fact is just the contrary, and\nthat there are very few who have the power to govern themselves as well in this respect as I can, especially whose natural disposition \ninclines them so strongly in that direction.\nTo be sure if I begin a story of any kind, I always like to finish it, but then I can have a dozen such things in the room by the  week and never\nlook at them.  I can read just as little such things as I please, and I do not approve of such light reading especially when one is studying.\nI am quite select in my reading, though I have not read much at all yet this term, but intend to more sometime.\nI intend to read a good deal, & to read much better than I ever have, more thoroughly.\nBy the way I mean sometimes, perhaps this year to read Walter Scotts works, the Waverly Novels so called.  Their rank & importance in the\nliterary world is such that no one is educated without them.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101764,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101764","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:35:44+00:00","modified":"2020-07-27T01:27:40+00:00","filename":"46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg","authentication":"91d049d9c4208fbd1b9147eb02fb7044","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_003_002_o2.jpg","size":2026668,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3192,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058788986354776},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034650"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034650"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034650"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947665,"FileSize":2026668,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3192\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3192,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"23mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:49:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:46:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:46:50","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3744,"ExifImageLength":4222,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I have sent in a formal request to the Government of the college to have my term Bill remitted;  I don't know whether they have acted upon it\nor not yet.

I shall get about $7,00, I expect for taking care of the fire in one of\nthe recitation rooms this term, and probably $3,00 or 4,00 for sawing wood in the college yard.  On the other hand  I must find have some kind of a light\ncoat, a pair of shoes, 'my boots are about gone', and something to wear on my head.\nThe rest of my past term bill besides what I won't pay is about $3,00, the next will be $15, or 18,00 and my board bill  which must be paid\nat beginning of the next term about $12,00, probably.

But no one got tired, or would if longer.  The writer is called by the faculty about\nthe best orator who was ever here, which, you know is saying considerable, for some of the best writers in the country have graduated here.\nThe poem was by Charles Phelps Roberts, of Bangor.  It was very good, but would not compare with the Oration.  I don't think that\nRoberts has improved as much as he ought since he was at Bangor, he has been too much a rowdy.  I should not wonder if I had  improved\nthe most since then, considering that I could not write at all then, and he was a good writer.\nThe Pencinian Anniversary was on the 2d of April.  Oration by William Lowing Avery of Belfast, Modern History as affected by  Intellect & Force.\nIt was pretty good, but not to be compared to Butlers.  The Pencinian Pact, George Henry Kingsbury was sick, they waited two or three\nweeks and then had to procure a substitute.

After the oration you see, they 9 or 9 o'clock, they adjourn to Commons Hall, where a collation is served up in style, and\nthe evening finished which toasts, speeches.  The Feast of Reason & the flow of soul!\nI was regularly initiated as a member of the Theological Society of Bowd. Coll.\nMarch 26th  This society is of little importance compared with the others, though it owns a small library, and meets nominally once a fortnight for discussions\n& reading dissertations on moral subjects Sc. and it contains many good members.  It's object is the promotion & search for\ntruth.  It's charges are $1.00 initiation fee, and, 20 per term tax, besides fines.\nThe Initiation fee of the Penc. & Ath. is $3,00 and tax $,50 I believe, besides a Subscription.\nThe medical class this spring is called a very good one, members 70 or 80, Joseph Walker, Asa's brother is here, I see him once in a while.\nHe and three other young doctors plain country fellows, all from Wilton I believe, room together all in one room only, with two beds in it and a chair apiece,\ndown town,  I have been in to see them once or twice, they seem to be good clever sort of fellows & will make useful men.\nThis Joseph Walker is not so much of an to look at as either Asa or James.  Looks like them both though.\nI have been into one of the Medical Lectures once only, it was by Dr Peaslie a fine, pale, intellectual looking, rather young man, and was upon the moral\nduties of Physicians especially towards one another.  The way he talked about Doctors quarrelling want any complement to the profession!  It was a \nvery good lecture.\nI never have been into the dissecting rooms, I have smelt them enough though, many of other folks go in, Chum went in tother day, did not get \nover it all day.  They have a good many subjects this spring, bought from Baltimore, mostly colored.\nThe church, where we students attend meeting is to be taken down and a new one built this spring.  Last Sabbath, Mr Adams gave notice that\nnext night would be the last time they should worship in that house, and the students demonstrated their approbation by really almost\nclapping, or stamping in the church some of them.  Some protested to say that it was the greatest expression of approbatiom that Mr Adams ever received\nfrom the students, and to be sure, they were not quite so much to blame, when we consider the miserable accommodations they have there in the \nold church.  100 or 150 of them crowded together in that little miserable gallery, on such hard seats.\nApril 6th Monday Mr Adams preached his farewell sermon to the old House.  It was somewhat historical.  It appears that this church is a \ncentury and a quarter old, the first meeting house was built in 1720.  In 1728 the first regular minister was settled Robert Dunlop, a Scotchman, educated\nat Edinburgh and ancestor of the Gov Dunlop's etc. of Brunswick.  The Bible that he used in the pulpit was shown, also\none of sermons.  The present house was built in 1806, and the first use of it was for the first College Commencement, before it was finished.\nIt was then considered a very spacious as well as very beautiful house , about as it now is.  It has been preached in more\nthan 2000 sabbaths, and a thousand young men have received their degrees in it and gone forth to the world.  Mr Adams was settled in 1829.\nIt must be a very large church.  Me, it, said these more, and had, been for years, more than double the No. of families in the society that\nthere were pews in the house!  And many could not go to meeting for lack of seat.\nI do not wonder they wanted a new house, and finally concluded to build one.  They will probably have a splendid one.  It is to be on the same\nspot with the old one, and meanwhile, two or three months we shall have to attend meeting in the vestry, a great old farm like building downtown.\nThe matter, the manner, or the writing, of this letter are certainly nothing to boast of, but I think the size ought to recommend it in your eyes,\nit surely would in mind if I could receive such from home occasionally.\nThe next thing to it however would be such an one as Lucy wrote to me last, that was indeed a well filled letter, for which I am very much obliged\nto her, and take the opportunity to beg that she will repeat the favour and that frequently.

Mother & Brothers and Sisters                                                                                                        Bowd Coll.  Brunswick May 29th 1845\nDon't be pigheaded at the formidable appearance of this letter, thought I confess\nthat it might be a fit subject of apprehension if you consider yourselves destined to read all that I most\nmaliciously propose to 'inflict' upon you in this letter.  I almost tremble at myself, whether\nat your sufferings in reading it though, or at mine in writing it.  Could be different  to decide.\nI have just returned from Boston, got back here yesterday, Wednesday May 27.  I had a\nvery comfortable time of it:  was gone six days, and propose to myself as employment for this rainy\nday to inflict upon you a full record of all my adventures in this excursion.\nTo begin a little back.  Wednesday May 21st, as you know, was our term examination, that\nmorning I received a paper from you, and the next day sent one in return!  I passed\nthe Examination pretty comfortably.  In the Mathematics, trigonometry, very well and in\nLatin & French pretty well considering how well I had been on the review.  I received\nmy term bill, it was $11,01 and sent four letters to Eliab by Edwin Lee Brown.\nWith much hesitation I finally concluded to go to 'Bosting' and on Thursday May 22nd\nI started and walked down to Bath, 9 miles before noon.\nMoney $15,00 and a few coppers.  It was the sum of my possession, born together by\nevery method of finance, and the chance for meeting the bills to be bought against me when\nI came back home $35,00 to $60,00 dollars.  How would you go to Boston expecting to spend\nless than that there in a vacation.  I brought back more that I carried!!!!!\nI had neither Palise nor travelling bag and so many were going away to be gone only a few\ndays that I could not well get me.  So I rolled up a shirt and a few collars and put\ninto Pewtons Trunk and started.  I arrived at Bath about noon and I spent the \nafternoon in loafing about, and examining the place which I had never before seen.\nI should have called upon Susan Carpenter, now Mrs. Sewall, who lives there, if I had\nknown where she lived.  Abby Carpenter is also there now teaching school I believe\nas P.G. Clark told me.\nBath is a place of some business, considerable ship building\nbut it has an old fashioned look about it.  It has I suppose many rich men, and an\nabundance of good old fashioned fine residence, and good looking folks, but somehow\nit has something of a 'Sleepy Hollow' look about it, that is compared with some\nof our nowadays mushroom cities, and \"parvenu's\" cockneys, with their truly Yankee and\nanti true republican reverence for outside show and the semblance of apparent \nsplendor and comfort which they would not even recognise the genuine if by any strange\nchance they should happen to see it.\nMy dinner and Supper and Breakfast cost me $,10!  Steamboat started at 6P.M.\nSteamboat fare is $1,00 there are two boat evening on the line in opposition, both start every\nwhere at the same time, both were very fast boats so called, and there is quite a disposition to see\nwhich is the fastest, as well as which will get the most passengers to carry.\nWe got into Boston about 4 o'clock, till an hour earlier than the usual time.\nI walked the streets, and the newspaper in a reading room till about 9 oclock\nand then found my way to Union St. No 64, inquired of a certain freckled faced fellow\nif Mr. Humphrey Steven's' was there.  Then presented my card and claimed cousinship.\nThe fellow appeared glad enough to see me, and of course insisted upon my\nstopping with him which I remained in town.  He did not appear to have much more to\nsay than I had, which was as you may imagine rather inconvenient matter of conversation\nthat is to me with my negative capacities for talking upon 'nothing at all,'  as some practice.\nHowever I staid there to Dinner, and ? with him while I was there and took some 7 or 8 meals\nthere while I was in Boston.\nFriday & Saturday I loafed about and looked at\nthe 'Lions' such as I could find.  I visited the hot house,  enrolled my respect  name in its\nregister and paid $.08 for being gulled with a 'guide look.'  I went over to Charleston\nand visited the moment and Mary Ford.  The monument is certainly the best\nthing I ever saw, such simple, majestic, classic beauty, as it towers about the cities\nwhich lie before it.  I saw Monadnock Mountain from the top.  Everyone who goes\nup pays, 12 1\/2 to help finishing off the ground , paid as well as, 6 1\/4 for a book of verses.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101772,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101772","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:35:55+00:00","modified":"2020-07-27T01:27:40+00:00","filename":"e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg","authentication":"19438908ea96287797bf1bd9477fb108","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1345802,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

Coll. June 1845\n\nDear Mother,\nI suppose you have received a letter from\nme since you wrote last, although I have since received two or three letters\nfrom Bangor, one of which was partly written by  you.\nAfter receiving those letters from Bangor at the beginning of the term,\nI wrote one and directed to Joseph about a week ago, June 15th.\nI concluded then that I would mail no more letters until\nafter July 11th.  Perhaps I shall not send no more letters until\nJuly 11th.  Perhaps I shall not send this till then.  It will \ndo me harm to have some letters written before hand ready to send.\nBy the way, as postage will then be less than half as much, it\nwill be well to write about twice as many letters; I hope you will bear\nthis suggestion in mind, all of you at home, and write to me.\nI am getting along pretty comfortably this term, for so far.\nThe principal excitement has been about our College Societies.\nI am an Athenaean.  My Chum & I you remember, arrived here one \nday to late to join last term.  I suppose I was rather prejudiced in favor\nof the Athenean when I came here; at least Mr Task was on Athenaen and \nmost of my old acquaintances.  But the best part of our Class are Pencinians,\nI got perhaps the most acquainted with Pencinians  & liked them best.\nIn some respects the Pencinian has the advantage; It is the oldest society,\nand its graduate members are probably more influential although\nperhaps hardly so public spirited.  I was extremely puzzled to decide.\nMy Chum was also Athenaean when he came here and came from Waterville, but he\nby immense fishing was finally coaxed off & joined Pencinian, though he did not\ndecide till the very day.  We made a find excitement I assure you; two such\nmembers are not found every day, even here, and you can hardly conceive the \ninterest felt and the efforts made to get us into either society.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101776,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101776","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d982c574abe4027c0e9fe4ad05219b67.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d982c574abe4027c0e9fe4ad05219b67.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d982c574abe4027c0e9fe4ad05219b67.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d982c574abe4027c0e9fe4ad05219b67.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:36:01+00:00","modified":"2020-07-27T01:27:40+00:00","filename":"d982c574abe4027c0e9fe4ad05219b67.jpg","authentication":"3d68a3205bf1e354139e6052ded55140","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_006_002_o2.jpg","size":1703442,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3003,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.052522847522848},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035105"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035105"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035105"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d982c574abe4027c0e9fe4ad05219b67.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947666,"FileSize":1703442,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3003\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3003,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:50:19","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:51:05","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:51:05","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3190,"ExifImageLength":3824,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I hardly know as I was noisy in joining as I did, & very possibly if my chum had\nbee Alh.

A students never is at college! I\nsuppose I must have one somewhere; but I think it would be hard to\nprove whether mine were at Milo or Foxcroft or Bangor now, I guess\nit would go back to Foxcroft even now in law, it was the last place I have\nbeen in any settled business I guess.  All any rate, it would be a \nsmall business to assess a tax organisation any where.\nYou rather misunderstood me that study was irksome\nto me.  I don't think it is.  I like to study as well as others at least.\nI had got rather worn out last term to be sure, the term was very long, I\nhad little rest since last August.  I had two weeks in vacation and now \nfeel much better for study or any thing else.  I think likely indeed that\na liberal education would have done Joseph more good than myself.\nBut not because my mind is not so disciplined as to fix it & fix it well upon","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101778,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101778","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/bf4f77ab0e529124cd5fa22e890ea7d0.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/bf4f77ab0e529124cd5fa22e890ea7d0.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/bf4f77ab0e529124cd5fa22e890ea7d0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/bf4f77ab0e529124cd5fa22e890ea7d0.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:36:04+00:00","modified":"2020-07-27T01:27:40+00:00","filename":"bf4f77ab0e529124cd5fa22e890ea7d0.jpg","authentication":"7be62dc8ec3aa8623c81fcb7711d82cd","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_006_004_o2.jpg","size":1676979,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3006,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051655300510091},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035120"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035120"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035120"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"bf4f77ab0e529124cd5fa22e890ea7d0.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947666,"FileSize":1676979,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3006\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3006,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:50:23","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:51:20","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:51:20","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3137,"ExifImageLength":3756,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"any thing.  I can pay as alone attention to anything, or learn anything thing as\nquick as most any one can, but I lack the energy of will to confine myself\ndown to any thing for hour after hour, or day after day.  There is a constitutional\ndifference between Joseph & me.  Eliab is still different.  I think he has a\nmuch more natural talent than either Joseph or I, but I do not think that all\nthe training in the world could ever make him half so great a man\nas Joseph might have been, with suitable advantages of education.\nMy next door classmate will sit down and bore right into a lesson steady for \nthree, four, or five hours right off without flinching or weariness of mind.  If I do the same\nfor one hour, I do well like most every else.  But very likely I should get the lesson\nin me hour that he would in three.  Still this iron energy of will, this indefatigable\nproperty of mind, with physical constitution to support it, is invaluable.\nIt is the stuff to make great men of.  The rational capacity of mind has\nvery little to do with ultimate success.  The mind, my mind, is sufficiently capable\nof cultivation and improvement, indefinitely capable; for success it requires only\nthe power of application and perseverance of mind, supported by a sufficient physical\nconstitution.  I don't think I am naturally deficient in any of these things, and\nI believe that with an equal chance and without disadvantages I might have been\nable to take a rank in any class, but entering here as I did , with my whole\nprefatory studies four years old, and two thirds forgot, and the studies of the freshman year\nhalf learned in 4 or 5 months, I could not expect to be a very thorough\nscholar, or to take rank, even if I tried to, over those with so many a advantage\nover me.  Still I believe my standing in my class, which is a very good one,\nis respectable.  I am certainly among the best Mathematicians in the class\nand not very decidedly inferior in any thing.  Not to say though that I should\nnot be if others were what they might be.  There are very few college students who\nmake much improvement of their advantage here as they might, in fact it is not to\nbe expected that they would where they can get along so easily with so little study as\nby can have if they chose.  It is not very often that the really talented fellows, and\nthere are many such here, take the rank, or the heist stand in college.  It is the\ninferior minds usually, but patient, persevering, frequently unpopular with their mates\nsometimes one in a thousand, impelled by a principle of duty, usually ambition.\nI can't say that I should not like right well to take a junior part.\nor an oration when I graduate, if I ever do, or be President or Orator of a college\nsociety next year, but still I hardly think that my ambition will ever have\na great effect upon my efforts, or influence my exertions in any great degree\nI can in that it does others.\nI suppose it ought to merit.\nI hope you will write oftener, tell me what is going on, you do not know how\nmuch good it does me to hear from home.  Tell me what to do, what shall I \ndo this fall.  I suppose I must stay out if I can get a school anywhere.  You don't\nknow how much I hate to though or how much good it would do me to stay, in many\nrespects.  if I had, or could get 100 dolls nothing would keep me out, only these two years\nnow that I have to stay.

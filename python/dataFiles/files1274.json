I saw him coming in, in the morning, as I was out hoeing praties. but before I had eaten my breakfast, and got down town, he was gone; So I dont know whether he got some money of Morren?, or sold his wool, or got me a ? on Me!  I have been tryingunderlined to prepare a composition, also writing to Ann about some book etc. to day; rather worldly employment to be sure, but I am hurried, there is great scrabble, in school now about review and preparation for examinations?  There is one thing which I want a little advice about.  I expect that James ? Walker would be very glad of an invite to go up to Milo with me and make hay a spell.  Now the thing is would it do?  considering etc.  He would have the tactunderlined to see whether he wanted I spose, but I think he would like to come if he were urged a little.  I should not have written now except for this, as I wrote so lately  Somehow I thought Charles did not look quite so well, healthy, as usual, when he was down here.  Is his health good now? I did not have a chance to see or speak to him, hardly at all, I don't know whether he noticed me in morning, or not, I was up to the farm with Mr. W. and James, hoeing potatoes; but he took the Centre St. so I could not speak to him.  I have not hardly concluded yet, whether to run home and go to haying before school is finished or stay and take the consequences at the Examination. I have been trying to hammer out a composition for a about a week.  As I had nothing to write about and nothing to write about I could not make out much.  I have been trying to espatch up something, by taking a peice out one book and a slice out of another, a line here and a sentence there, twisting it every way, but I fear they will convict me of Plagiarism  I could not do any better no harm though as I can see","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101713,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101713","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/adb7d2e25d87811a93a37f8df991f6bf.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/adb7d2e25d87811a93a37f8df991f6bf.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/adb7d2e25d87811a93a37f8df991f6bf.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/adb7d2e25d87811a93a37f8df991f6bf.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:34:32+00:00","modified":"2020-08-27T02:36:02+00:00","filename":"adb7d2e25d87811a93a37f8df991f6bf.jpg","authentication":"ce7e6f74854dd953fe23385bf0a071a8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_155_007_002_o2.jpg","size":1164916,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2183,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049410257715342000006675249323961907066404819488525390625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["033846"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["033846"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["033846"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"adb7d2e25d87811a93a37f8df991f6bf.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947663,"FileSize":1164916,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2183\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2183,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:47:50","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:38:46","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:38:46","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"SubSecTimeOriginal":51,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3018,"ExifImageLength":4976,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Mr. C.W.

I thought it would be best to have the wool here and I might be able to sell it sometime; it is now safely stored away up garret.  Hardy any one wanted to buy wool, it had fallen at Boston and New York, and they said they have lost money by what they had bought, 33 and a third seemed the common price, but at Campbell and Mils, I was offered 37 half.  I thought Charles would not be willing to have it sold at that price and that it had better stay here.\nOn going to school this morning, the scholars all appeared glad to see me again, more afraid they had lost me so, but Mr. Worcester said never a word till the Latin Class were called, he heard all before me, and then addressed me thus; \"Isaac, you left school before the close of the term, and according to the regulations of the Committee, I have no authority to admit to the school, without a certificate from Mr. Abbot, C.L.L.B.\"\nAt recess I left the school and went over to Mr. Abbots office.

The pants I shall wear a good deal, I guess, this fall, they are fixed up nicely.  The coat also will do me some good.  I guess but the sleeves and collar are so large that it looks awkwardly here; It would be just the thing to mean about all my work this fall and to school in cold, rainy weather, if I had any kind of a jacket; a thin one a baise ones are much worn here to work on school or anything a chick one.  I don't know but that camblet or old white one, only Joseph wants it and it is too very thick;  Something that would do to wear under it.  One frock coat wider another would not do so well you know.  You see how one want satisfied only makes another?  I believe that the price of wool is rising.  I guess that it will sell soon pretty well.  I had better sell it if you get, 50 per bbl. had not I.  The tailor says that I can have a frock from my cloth by  having a velvet collar, which would cost $1,25 and they are much worn so, on it would make a dress coat and a single breasted vest.  I concluded that the dress coat, vest, and $1,25 would do me more good than the frock coat.

The girl is quite young (note the good old one who cannot come yet) and without exactly asking I have found out that Mrs. W would not want any addition to the family but I think Lucy had better come and board at Mr. Cutlers, they would probably board here a little cheaper if she did her own washing and perhaps might pay part in produce at his store and C. take the money instead.  She would learn as much there about behavior company as here, and with regarding to introducing her time out of school, she must learn to have decision of character and independence enough to do what is right and proper without being led by others; a most useful lesson and one that can be gained best by experience.  I should have gone on up to Mr. Cutler's this afternoon if it had just raised, but there is not doubt but they will take her and she must get ready as soon as she can.  I shall send word as soon as I have been there and she had better come as soon as possible afterward, so as to be here as near the beginning of the term as she can.  Well, what kind of a school will she go to?  Why, the committee who came in yesterday, called it a new select school for girls, in telling the scholars (and teacher too I suppose) how much they expected of them.  It consists of 44 girls, from 10 to 15 mostly, no boys, so you see it is just the school for Lucy and if she comes with a determination to study she can improve much and be a help to me.  I should rather she would go to Mr. Pomroy' meeting and perhaps I can arrange it so as to have her in our S.S in that case she would attending meeting here in the forenoon, though that meeting is as good as this.\n\n I want my thick shoes to work in the garden with.\n[top upside down] You must write often.

I said that she did nicely.  How did it turn out?  This term she has got, I suppose the very best school, taught by a female in the city!!  A New Select School!!! consisting of girls only; just about the right number; just about the right age; and moreover, just the very place for Lucy!!!!!  The next thing is, I suppose, for Lucy to get here as soon as possible.  It seems as if you would need her at home this Summer, but I think it is altogether too good a chance to be lost, or found every day either, especially if she can get boarded at Mrs Cutlers for 7\/6 per week.  Can't you get little Olive again this Summer?  It is a pity that Charles cannot improve this nice early spring, so as to get his crops in good season, and for once in the May, get fairly beforehand.  He ought to have had some of his wheat sown before this rain today: but I suppose he has not.  I fear he will conclude that his 6 days time and fuss spent for 10, dollars worth of hayseed, that he wanted to sow himself, was ......, not quite wasted, - but this applied.  It is so dark that I can write no longer.\nI have sold the smallest box of butter for 14 cts per pound, 12 quarter pound $1,71 I have enquired somewhat, but do not think I shall be able to sell the seeds.  It is too late, every body has got a full stock, more than they can sell; it is possible that I could sell them for money I would take pay out of the store, not otherwise.\nI was pretty lucky in selling the butter at 14 even I think; they were selling good butter out of the stores at 12 and 13, but one morn Almer Taylor who appeased to be a connoisseur, bring a little for his own family, took it home to use, but did not want the large box. 2 pounds was enough.  Perhaps I can sell some of the seed, as may as he want to sow, off to Mr. Walker, he has got all his seeds & garden to buy.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101725,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101725","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:34:48+00:00","modified":"2020-08-27T03:43:30+00:00","filename":"36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg","authentication":"b15255d7b4a327beb37a75aec862e71c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_156_001_003_o2.jpg","size":1495564,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2887,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04796610604369500041599394535296596586704254150390625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034012"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034012"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034012"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947663,"FileSize":1495564,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2887\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2887,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:48:19","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:40:12","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:40:12","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3107,"ExifImageLength":3874,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"There is a class beginning French this term, or going to, I wish I could study with them, but I don't hardly know whether I should have time.

Feb. 1, but I did not see him at all!  Which was altogether too bad.  You see Ellen Lee called the eve before and said he was coming - he was not here till after school time and it was Sat and school kept by reason of Compositions till about dinner time.  So after dinner, I went downtown to look for him, hunted all over town and found him not!  Came home, and he had been here, staid on a few minutes and started for Milo!  I suppose that I went one way to look for him and he came up to Mr. W.s another and so we escaped one another.  I was a good deal disappointed.  You can't hardly think how much good it does one, when away to see anything from home.  Just to see the horses would be a pleasure.  You did not make out to write a very long letter, I believe and Eliab did not write any at all, what is the reason?  \nYou said you was going to send Josephs' last letter, but it did not come.  Also \"Josephs letter to me, that we sent out, ought to be sent back, however?\nAnn and I have recently written to Boston, a letter.  I received a letter from James Walker at Hancocks, a while ago and have lately answered it.  Sent last post Feb 1.\nThere is one thing, which I have forgotten every time, that  we have written home this term.  There was a little bundle of papers, tied or bound up with a paper, which I left at Milo, among the books be that Ann was to bring down.  She brought A not and I want it very much here.  It contained many different things, in south of things, skeletons of Compositions etc.!!","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101728,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101728","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ead3fe066c7467d4bb2d4dc43819d077.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ead3fe066c7467d4bb2d4dc43819d077.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ead3fe066c7467d4bb2d4dc43819d077.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ead3fe066c7467d4bb2d4dc43819d077.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:34:52+00:00","modified":"2020-08-27T03:57:15+00:00","filename":"ead3fe066c7467d4bb2d4dc43819d077.jpg","authentication":"110b2709398d6f297e010231b507759e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_156_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1777821,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2830,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05816715744012600219914332910775556229054927825927734375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034029"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034029"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034029"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ead3fe066c7467d4bb2d4dc43819d077.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947664,"FileSize":1777821,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2830\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2830,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:48:26","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:40:29","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:40:29","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3093,"ExifImageLength":3934,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Besides that, there was a kind of a book that I made a good while ago a note of some translations of Geography on part of.  It will never be of any use to anyone there and I should use it here.  That was also left among the books, etc. that Ann, was to bring down.  If these things are, \"lying round\", as is most likely, I wish you would send them down when there is a chance, neither trouble or cost.  Also Mr. Walkers letter to me while I was at Milo. The pants you sent back mended me just about the thing -just right every way - I shall wear them a good deal.  My other pantaloons, on account of their being so much too long; (which makes them wrinkle up and look very ugly,) are not hardly decent to wear to meeting, however, I get along after a portion by keeping my Surtout on pretty constantly!!  If you make it up another pair, do make them 3 inches shorter, at least, they will last very much longer.  The drab ones 'you mended', are plenty long.  NOW.\nCharles, ought to take better care of his 'finger'.  I expect that he hurt it once, trying to get my foolish little pony in the ferry port.  It may be because I am not singer myself, but, I really have no faith in singing schools.  I can not help thinking myself, that it would be very much better, for both Charles & Eliab to spend their evenings at home, staying or sending some good useful or entertained in instruction books.  Besides, the money they pay Mr. Thatch would furnish them with oil all winter!!  I have no objection to Mr. Hatch's getting some money so or any other way {I almost said that he might it it by his blacksmithing, for all nec. but that is too.}\nHowever, I don't think that he is anything very extra in singing and Mr W heartily despises all his singing or music etc. and he is great.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101729,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101729","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d5807192ea83f1267f8d417f4a3a8973.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d5807192ea83f1267f8d417f4a3a8973.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d5807192ea83f1267f8d417f4a3a8973.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d5807192ea83f1267f8d417f4a3a8973.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:34:54+00:00","modified":"2020-08-27T03:57:55+00:00","filename":"d5807192ea83f1267f8d417f4a3a8973.jpg","authentication":"ec45dc3e43690795a02ef61adf7b64a1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_156_002_003_o2.jpg","size":1880435,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2979,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058447248020090998565923001706323702819645404815673828125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034033"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034033"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034033"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d5807192ea83f1267f8d417f4a3a8973.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947664,"FileSize":1880435,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2979\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2979,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:48:28","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:40:33","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:40:33","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"SubSecTimeOriginal":63,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3182,"ExifImageLength":3845,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Feb 10th 8th 1840\n\nDear Mother\nI write the following about a week since, but hurry bc. has prevented my finishing the thing, - it can hardly be called a letter.

I am ? to hear where you are & what you are doing. How does Eliab spend the winter? He must not forget his religion. Young Christians have especial need to watch. Eliab ought to be studying something.\nHabits of idleness & inapplication of mind are easily formed, but thrown off with difficulty.   The state of religion is low here & seemingly everywhere about.   I hope you will write mesome good, long, oldfashioned letters, as you used to; have Eliab write, do him good. Ann too.

I laugh at him some for pursuing a College course so far before he has concluded whether to go or not.  If he is not going he had better do something else.  We may not write again before you come home & about getting anything if there is any way to get them - you know what we need I suppose.

Joseph.\n[top of page upside down] The people here are very extravigant in their expressions about Ann as a good teacher, - all with one cannot want her to keep the school this summer, but if I was here I should not- she can get better schools for higher wages.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101738,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101738","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/780ec6b4d67d8f2470b9e85e3421afd1.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/780ec6b4d67d8f2470b9e85e3421afd1.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/780ec6b4d67d8f2470b9e85e3421afd1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/780ec6b4d67d8f2470b9e85e3421afd1.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:35:06+00:00","modified":"2020-08-27T04:57:29+00:00","filename":"780ec6b4d67d8f2470b9e85e3421afd1.jpg","authentication":"684a1ac229ca2225353ab9dbdb336320","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_157_001_003_o2.jpg","size":1575736,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2923,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049914978269409000788403574233598192222416400909423828125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034204"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034204"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034204"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"780ec6b4d67d8f2470b9e85e3421afd1.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947664,"FileSize":1575736,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2923\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2923,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:48:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:42:04","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:42:04","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3174,"ExifImageLength":3908,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Foxcroft March 10th 184?\n\nDear Mother\nWe are all very pleasantly situated here, pleasant rooms. etc. etc.  Can step out of the back door into the Academy yard.\nI am on about the same foundation as last autumn;

They were, I should think their three best scholars there, nearly fitted for College, I think of going to Brunswick this fall.  I guess they are really first rate fellows & good scholars.  Isaac W.

Today.\nI suppose you are all wishing to hear, all how I got here, how I like, & how I get along.  To begin at the beginning Eliab can  tell how we got to Bangor, & I should like to hear from him how he got back.  I don't know as it was right for him to go home so into the sabbath.  What time did he arrive?  (How does Josephs coat suit.)  You know he can send it back. I hope Eliab did not get it injured in the rain.  The fact is, I know nothing what he wanted.\nHe did not even tell me how much he wished to give for one, which would have been a guide you know? The one I bought was precisely of the new fashion; perhaps you will not like it.  I had only the night to pick it out in, but I guess it is a pretty coat and cheap.  It was a perfect fit for me.  Mr. Norcross jun. of the Washington House had the mate to it, just alike for $12,00 I got it, 25 cheaper for the button lost.\nI went to Mr. Pomroys to tea Sunday.  AM gave me $5,00.  I heard Mr. Gough, (from Goff) Sab. Eve.  The best temperance lecturer, he has had great effect in Bangor. The young men need his influence.  It rained much Sab eve, & the wind blew all day hard.  So the steamboat passage was very rough & I was a good deal seasick:  I omitted to lay in provisions Sat, and had to get breakfast on board or I should have perished almost.

Sat, May 3rd, 1845\n Dear Mother\n\nI received your last excellent letter a little more than a week ago, week yesterday.  I guess I wrote a long letter the next day, and directed it to Joseph at Foxcroft.  I intended to write another great 'yaller one' this week, and direct to Eliab at Bangor, but I have been rather busy lately, and commence late.  I shall have a chance to send to Bangor, first of next week, by Thomas H. Rich one of our Bangor students who is going home at that time.  So I will try and improved the opportunity by sending some letters to Eliab and he may find such meaning of correspondence he chooses, I can from there to Milo for them.  by the way, vacation commenced a fortnight from next Thursday, being after the third Wed. of May; or May 22nd.  Thence Vacation is two weeks or until June 5th, normally, recitations commence 9th.\nNow if you want to send letters or anything to me at about that time, just bear it in mind.  I tell you while I happen to think of it!  that you can send anything to Eliab & he give it to Edwin L. Brown who goes home in vacation, and he will bring it right to me.\nBrown lives next room to me, at least on same floor.  I hardly know what to think about Eliab, or rather his new situation.  By the way, I guess I was partly the means of his getting the place.  You know.

I did to Joseph.\nThe Blessed Spirit of God has indeed been again bestowed upon Bowdoin College, in some measure, and when we consider the states of those written it's walls who have professed Christ, we can only wonder that so much has been done.\nThere has been no excitement, and but little said upon the subject, but the silent influence of the spirit has been working upon the minds of some.  Some four or five of our \nclass it is hoped have experienced a change of heart, and several of the other classes.  The best part of the students too, those who stand high.\nThe state of religion has been very low.  For some time the number of professing Christians has been very small in comparison, and worse yet religion with them, little more than a name.  Religion seemed to be left off, or thrown aside when one got to College as belonging somewhere else.  It was the case with those of best education & principles, even those of whom there are usually many, who are preparing for the ministry.\nThe first circle meeting I attended when I came back this spring.\nThornton, a wild fellow last fall who had been converted in Vacation had returned a Christian.  It was whispered that several were serious.\nA letter was received from the students at Bangor, most of whom you know from here number several last fall.  They had heard of the state of things here, were anxious about it, had appointed special prayer meetings, and decided connect with the circle here.

The Chapel itself in the middle between them, is 90 or 100 long, 30 to 40 wide, and nearly 90 high, magnificently lighted only from great gothic windows of stained glass over the Libraries.

Like the countenance of a friend, perhaps better yet, like a letter from home.\nThe letters were well filled with a variety of news and interesting matter, and I am very much obliged to you all therefore, and hope you will all\ncontinue to do as well in writing.  I was intending to write about a couple of letters in answer to yours, but as I happened to have some of this sort \nof paper I bethought me of writing a letter on a sheet of it, partly for the sport of it, and party for a spite upon Uncle Sam, whom I should like\nto cheat out of $500,00 if I could only do it honorably, out of the Post Office Department, before July.\nBy the way I intended to have carried up some paper like this to Milo, when I was there on purpose for you to write letters to me upon.\nI am getting on here just after the old sort about;  Have got my studies pretty much made up, except the Greek at least.  My Chum is the 'same old coon.' steady, industrious, studious, except poor fellow, the past  week he has got to reading Novels and really seems to have no kind of \ncommand over himself.  It is indeed a most terrible temptation to a person who has the taste already formed within him.\nTo be so surrounded with  them in every tempting form, every library, all kinds, & all authors really requires considerable self command not to be drawn into them and do nothing else but read novels from one weeks end to another.  Chum will have a fit, get drunk, he calls it, and read novels day & night almost, hardly getting his lessons at all for two or three days, or a week, and then for the reaction read no more such, but confine himself to the digest metaphysics or something for a long time.\nYou have said a good deal to me about not having any command over myself in such things, but I believe the fact is just the contrary, and\nthat there are very few who have the power to govern themselves as well in this respect as I can, especially whose natural disposition \ninclines them so strongly in that direction.\nTo be sure if I begin a story of any kind, I always like to finish it, but then I can have a dozen such things in the room by the  week and never\nlook at them.  I can read just as little such things as I please, and I do not approve of such light reading especially when one is studying.\nI am quite select in my reading, though I have not read much at all yet this term, but intend to more sometime.\nI intend to read a good deal, & to read much better than I ever have, more thoroughly.\nBy the way I mean sometimes, perhaps this year to read Walter Scotts works, the Waverly Novels so called.  Their rank & importance in the\nliterary world is such that no one is educated without them.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101764,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101764","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:35:44+00:00","modified":"2020-09-01T02:19:32+00:00","filename":"46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg","authentication":"91d049d9c4208fbd1b9147eb02fb7044","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_003_002_o2.jpg","size":2026668,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3192,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0587889863547760016526666504432796500623226165771484375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034650"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034650"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034650"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947665,"FileSize":2026668,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3192\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3192,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"23mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:49:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:46:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:46:50","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3744,"ExifImageLength":4222,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I have sent in a formal request to the Government of the college to have my term Bill remitted;  I don't know whether they have acted upon it\nor not yet.

The writer is called by the faculty about  the best orator who was ever here, which, you know is saying considerable, for some of the best writers in the country have graduated here.\n\nThe poem was by Charles Phelps Roberts, of Bangor.  It was very good, but would not compare with the Oration.  I don't think that\nRoberts has improved as much as he ought since he was at Bangor, he has been too much a rowdy.  I should not wonder if I had  improved\nthe most since then, considering that I could not write at all then, and he was a good writer.\nThe Peucinian Anniversary was on the 2d of April.  Oration by William Lowing Avery of Belfast, Modern History as affected by  Intellect & Force.\nIt was pretty good, but not to be compared to Butlers.

After the oration you see, they 9 or 9 o'clock, they adjourn to Commons Hall, where a collation is served up in style, and the evening finished which toasts, speeches.  The Feast of Reason & the flow of soul!\n\n  I was regularly initiated as a member of the Theological Society of Bowd. Coll.\n\nMarch 26th  This society is of little importance compared with the others, though it owns a small library, and meets nominally once a fortnight for discussions & reading dissertations on moral subjects Sc. and it contains many good members.  It's object is the promotion & search for\ntruth.  It's charges are $1.00 initiation fee, and, 20 per term tax, besides fines. The Initiation fee of the Penc. & Ath. is $3,00 and tax $,50 I believe, besides a Subscription.\n\n   The medical class this spring is called a very good one, members 70 or 80, Joseph Walker, Asa's brother is here, I see him once in a while. He and three other young doctors plain country fellows, all from Wilton I believe, room together all in one room only, with two beds in it and a chair apiece,\n\ndown town,  I have been in to see them once or twice, they seem to be good clever sort of fellows & will make useful men.\nThis Joseph Walker is not so much of an to look at as either Asa or James.  Looks like them both though.\n\nI have been into one of the Medical Lectures once only, it was by Dr Peaslie a fine, pale, intellectual looking, rather young man, and was upon the moral duties of Physicians especially towards one another.  The way he talked about Doctors quarrelling want any complement to the profession!  It was a very good lecture. I never have been into the dissecting rooms, I have smelt them enough though, many of other folks go in, Chum went in tother day, did not get over it all day.  They have a good many subjects this spring, bought from Baltimore, mostly colored.\n     The Church, where we students attend meeting is to be taken down and a new one built this spring.  Last Sabbath, Mr Adams gave notice that\n\nnext night would be the last time they should worship in that house, and the students demonstrated their approbation by really almost clapping, or stamping in the church some of them.  Some pretend to say that it was the greatest expression of approbation that Mr Adams ever received\nfrom the students, and to be sure, they were not quite so much to blame, when we consider the miserable accommodations they have there in the \nold church.  100 or 150 of them crowded together in that little miserable gallery, on such hard seats.\nApr. 6th Today Mr Adams preached his farewell sermon to the old House.  It was somewhat historical.  It appears that this church is a \ncentury and a quarter old, the first meeting house was built in 1720.  In 1728 the first regular minister was settled Robert Dunlop, a Scotchman, educated at Edinburgh and ancestor of the Gov Dunlop's etc. of Brunswick.  The Bible that he used in the pulpit was shown, also one of sermons.  The present house was built in 1806, and the first use of it was for the first College Commencement, before it was finished. It was then considered a very spacious as well as very beautiful house , about as it now is.  It has been preached in more than 2000 sabbaths, and a thousand young men have received their degrees in it and gone forth to the world.  Mr Adams was settled in 1829. It must be a very large church.  Me, it, said these more, and had, been for years, more than double the No. of families in the society that there were pews in the house!  And many could not go to meeting for lack of seat. I do not wonder they wanted a new house, and finally concluded to build one.  They will probably have a splendid one.  It is to be on the same\nspot with the old one, and meanwhile, two or three months we shall have to attend meeting in the vestry, a great old farm like building downtown.\nThe matter, the manner, or the writing, of this letter are certainly nothing to boast of, but I think the size ought to recommend it in your eyes,\nit surely would in mind if I could receive such from home occasionally. The next thing to it however would be such an one as Lucy wrote to me last, that was indeed a well filled letter, for which I am very much obliged to her, and take the opportunity to beg that she will repeat the favor and that frequently.  Also Joseph and all the rest of you. I wish that Eliab would realize the importance of writing to him, the benefit it would be to him.\nI think Mother that you ought to take time and write good long letters to him.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101766,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101766","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3f555fc22c7df9f6ccba921202cefd82.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3f555fc22c7df9f6ccba921202cefd82.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3f555fc22c7df9f6ccba921202cefd82.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3f555fc22c7df9f6ccba921202cefd82.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:35:47+00:00","modified":"2020-09-01T02:19:59+00:00","filename":"3f555fc22c7df9f6ccba921202cefd82.jpg","authentication":"4e5156c8aad277d24912934982543cf4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_003_004_o2.jpg","size":1913015,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3194,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05545742596071299990168057547634816728532314300537109375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034717"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034717"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034717"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3f555fc22c7df9f6ccba921202cefd82.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947666,"FileSize":1913015,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3194\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3194,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"22mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:49:56","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:47:17","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:47:17","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3582,"ExifImageLength":4037,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Isaac March 30\n\n         1845\n\nBowd\n[postmark]BRUNSWICK ME APR 7                                             12ct\n\n                                                            Mrs. Anna M.

Me.\n[left-hand side, upside down] Our studies this term are 1st Rhetoric, 2d Trigonometry, 3 French. Rhetoric is our ? recitation. It is called by most of the class very hard, that is in the way we are required to study it. It is called Anglylytically. There are no questions and no questions asked. The first one who is called upon, and no one knows who will come first, must get up and commence the lesson, and tell it off, not word for word, but the ideas all of them, without any question or prompting, till he is told to stop, and an other called upon to take it up and go with it in the same manner. This is really harder to many, or was at first, then to commit the whole of it to memory. It is Newman's Rhetorik and the lesson is 6 to10 pages taken up so, and the review so tis 12-20 pages, this gone over every morning.\n\n  It comes dreadful hard to many, most of the class. My next neighbor, Joseph Mason, a smart fellow too and fine Scholar, he has been teaching one of the principal public schools in Hallowell for two years and a half summer & winter. & has acquired a fine reputation there. While he has been there he has about fitted for College and studied the four terms in advance! out of College at the same time teaching that school. As I was saying, this great Mason, and he is really quite a fellow, studies on that Rhetoric some 5 hours hard per day average and then can not hardly make it pass right.  I study it rarely two hours, oftener an hour or even half, and always 'sail' or have as yet.\n In connection with the Rhetoric, we have begun the writing of themes. We have commenced by forming as a separate exercise regular plans or skeletons of themes on appointed. This is really a harder business to make a regular connected plan or system then to write a theme itself.\n Many of the Class I suppose have never so much as written a theme so that I stand a better chance among them, by the way Tutor complimented my plan last week.\n Our Forenoon recitation is Trigonometry now Prof. Smyths. I like it. It is different from the little in the surveying, goes right into it. first shows how the tables are formed. It takes some time, now, as I work the problems all out & keep manuscripts.\n French is easy. Recitation is the longest part of it. I wish I had some good Mathematical instruments.\n\n[bottom of page] Mr. Adams read the Book of Haggar today. I commend it to your consideration, Ye people of Milo. Part of it is exceedingly applicable to you, and considerable of it to some.\n[right of upside down part] I dont know whether I shall ever get much interested in studies as I feel in things and\n[middle right center beside upside down part] This is probably a mistake ? that I was designed rather a laborer than a scholar. I shall be homesick or farmsick this summer I expect. It amuses me to see how different I am from others in this respect.\n[middle left center beside upside down part] I am much obliged to Lucy for the opportunity of perusing her Temperance poem.

I don't get a great deal of news.  Your two last letters were not\nvery well filled up.  What is the matter of Sister Lucy about writing?   It is rather an old trick with the rest of you!\n\n   I got a splendid letter from Joseph last week.  I owe him an apology for my remarks on letter writing. As he don't deserve any reproof in that respect, he must not take it as such.  I shall write to him as soon as he defines his whereabouts.  I suppose he will not stay at home\n I wish you could write more particularly.  You dont know how I should like to hear about every thing, every little (underlined) thing at home.\n\nI want to know how the house gets along; and the farming (underlined). Has Charles sold any hay?  Who is his hired man?  What is the matter of his ? tear in page does he do his spring work?  I should think the spring  has been so far very favorable .  It has been very dry by here.  Perfect weather is coming now though. I was never intended for a 'literary' character.  It is almost astonishing how much more interest I naturally take in every thing else, especially in farm affairs.  I believe my mind is good enough that I might succeed well among scholars, if I loved study enough to apply myself sufficiently.  I do lack that  unyielding energy of soul which some have to pin themselves down & task the mind.  My mind is more inclined to be indolent than my body.  For this last fortnight of the term, especially in reviewing, it has been a 'dreadful bore' to me to apply my mind.  Even a consciousness of the importance to me of the coming examination could not compel it.  I expect I shall be obliged to 'rank' with those who trust to 'science'  and 'wits', rather than to application & diligent preparation for examination. I wish you would consider the letters I have written home this term & then\ntake to yourselves doubled (underlined) your requests to write more

Brunswick May 29th 1845\nDon't be frightened at the formidable appearance of this letter, though I confess\nthat it might be a fit subject of apprehension if you consider yourselves destined to read all that I most\nmaliciously propose to 'inflict' upon you in this letter.  I almost tremble at myself, whether\nat your sufferings in reading it though, or at mine in writing it.  Could be different  to decide.\nI have just returned from Boston, got back here yesterday, Wednesday May 27.  I had a\nvery comfortable time of it:  was gone six days, and propose to myself as employment for this rainy\nday to inflict upon you a full record of all my adventures in this excursion.\nTo begin a little back.  Wednesday May 21st, as you know, was our term examination, (that\nmorning I received a paper from you, and the next day sent one in return)  I passed\nthe Examination pretty comfortably.  In the Mathematics, trigonometry, very well and in\nLatin & French pretty well considering how idle I had been on the review.  I received\nmy term bill, it was $11,01 and sent four letters to Eliab by Edwin Lee Brown.\nWith much hesitation I finally concluded to go to 'Bosting' and on Thursday May 22nd\nI started and walked down to Bath, 9 miles before noon.\nMoney $15,00 and a few coppers.  It was the sum of my possessions, drawn together by\nevery method of finance, and the reliance for meeting the bills to be brought against me when\nI came back.  Some $35,00 to $60,00 dollars.  Few would go to Boston expecting to spend\nless than that there in a vacation.  I brought back more that I carried!!!!!\nI had neither Valise nor travelling bag and so many were going away to be gone only a few\ndays that I could not well get one.  So I rolled up a shirt and a few collars and put\ninto Pewtons Trunk and started.  I arrived at Bath about noon and I spent the \nafternoon in loafing about, and examining the place which I had never before seen.\nI should have called upon Susan Carpenter, now Mrs. Sewall, who lives there, if I had\nknown where she lived.  Abby Carpenter is also there now teaching school I believe\nas P.G. Clark told me.\nBath is a place of some business, considerable ship building\nbut it has an old fashioned look about it.  It has I suppose many rich men, and an\nabundance of good old fashioned fine residences, and good looking folks, but somehow\nit has something of a 'Sleepy Hollow' look about it, that is compared with some\nof our nowadays mushroom cities, and \"parvenu's\" cockneys, with their truly Yankee and\nanti true republican reverence for outside show and the semblance of apparent \nsplendor and comfort while they would not even recognise the genuine if by any strange\nchance they should happen to see it.\nMy dinner and Supper and Breakfast cost me $,10!  Steamboat started at 6P.M.\nSteamboat fare is $1,00 there are two boat running on the line in opposition, both start every\nwhere at the same time, both are very fast boats so called, and there is quite a disposition to see\nwhich is the fastest, as well as which will get the most passengers to carry.\nWe got into Boston about 4 o'clock, A.M. an hour earlier than the usual time.\nI walked the streets, or read the newspaper in a reading room till about 9 oclock\nand then found my way to Union St. No 64, inquired of a certain freckled faced fellow\nif Mr. Humphrey Steven's' was there.  Then presented my card and claimed cousinship.\nThe fellow appeared glad enough to see me, and of course insisted upon my\nstopping with him while I remained in town.  He did not appear to have much more to\nsay than I had, which was as you may imagine rather inconvenient matter of conversation\nthat is to me with my negative capacities for talking upon 'nothing at all,'  as some practice.\nHowever I staid there to Dinner, and Slept? with him while I was there and took some 7 or 8 meals\nthere while I was in Boston.\nFriday & Saturday I loafed about and looked at\nthe 'Lions' such as I could find.  I visited the Statehouse,  enrolled my respectable  name in its\nregister and paid $.08 for being gulled with a 'guide book.'  I went over to Charleston\nand visited the Monument and Navy Yard.  The monument is certainly the best\nthing I ever saw, such simple, majestic, classic beauty, as it towers above the cities\nwhich lie before it.  I saw Monadnock Mountain from the top.  Everyone who goes\nup pays, 12 1\/2 to help finishing off the ground , paid as well as, 6 1\/4 for a book of Views.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101772,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101772","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:35:55+00:00","modified":"2020-08-29T03:58:10+00:00","filename":"e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg","authentication":"19438908ea96287797bf1bd9477fb108","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1345802,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2140,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0582295777085500010361585054852184839546680450439453125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034930"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034930"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034930"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947666,"FileSize":1345802,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2140\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2140,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:50:10","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:49:30","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:49:30","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2989,"ExifImageLength":5028,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Saturday night I went with Humphrey to call upon Mrs. Child he introduced me Sabbath forenoon I went to the Central Church Winter Street, Rev. Mr. Rogers church. It was about the first church I was ever in I believe. The Choir of singers was nearly 100. A Mr. Angell I believe his name was of Buffalo, New York, preached, about as smart a Sermon as I ever heard.  In the Afternoon I went to hear Mr. Kirk in his new ? church on Beacon Hill. He is called you know the greatest pulpit Orator in North America. Perhaps the celebrated  Mr. Kirk (not knowing that I was to hear him, you see! did not put his Mighty Powers to the utmost: but I certainly thought the Buffalo man preached the greatest sermon. Both Mr. Kirk's & Mr. Roger's churches are new and both finished off in the same way. The Pews are all arcs of Circles, clear round, having the Pulpit in the centre. There are two broad aisles, and the side aisles are next to the  wall all around; no wall pews: These Churches seat 1200 people each. By the way Mr. Benjamin W. Bush belongs to the Central Church. I saw him in the street Saturday, om Sabbath I sat in his pew, and his little Ben took me by the hand and pulled me home to dinner with him. They had all manner of enquiries to make about Folks, especially about Millerism in relation to James  & Almeda  etc.etc.\n\n Mr. Bush who seems to be a very sensible man in all subjects, seemed to fear they had been led into excuses & extravagances as others were. And told me something of their doings in Boston.\n    In the evening I went with Humprey to the Tremont Temple and heard Dr. Beecher of Cincinnati address young men upon the importance of the Sabbath.  What a place that Tremont Temple is. I do not know how many thousands of people it can accommodate some 4000, 5000, I should think though.  The speaker has his hearers above and below and around him. before, behind, and on all sides. That night every seat was crowded and the aisles & passages filled up besides. I got a pretty good seat at first but gave it up to some ladies, there were very many standing, and crowded myself up the aisle, for I think a great deal of having a good chance to see a speaker's eyes, as well as to not and understand his hands. On this occasion I cared twice as much for this as I did for a Seat.  However they began to bring Settees from the Vestries into the aisles, and I got a good seat on one, close to the speaker. What little iron faced, rough looking fellows those great Western men are the Beechers and Prof. Stowe. Old Dr. Beecher has a splendid way of 'laying it down' though. I mean to take his oratory sometime to knock over our stiff 'Tutor Boody', that we declaim before with. Neither he, nor Mr. Kirk, nor the other great folks, were afraid to raise their left hands occasionally, or even to move their boots on the floor sometimes. Humphrey goes to Mr. Huntingdon's Church with Mrs. Child. He goes there and goes to Meeting with her always, I guess.\n\nHumphrey's folks, Mr. Albee's go to Dr. Beecher's jun. Church in Salem Street. Mr. Albee has a small store of most every thing, country trade. His wife, rather a pretty sort of a woman. Humphrey said is his cousin. I know nothing who she is, but she seemed to know about every body, and inquired  for you folks. Who is She? Her name is Martha. She has two children. I though from what Mrs. Child Said that she though Humphrey and Albee were in partnership. I understood him that he has $30.00 per Month.\n\n Sat. I attended the Exhibition of the Boston Latin School. Consisted of 20 related declamations and then Assignment of Peices. They were all boys. The first prize was given to a little fellow H.H. Coolidge hardly bigger than little James Searles! We must have better teachers of Rhetoric and Oratory here before Bowdoin Students can appear as well, in the matter of ease and grace that is, as those Boston boys did. \n\nThere were 5 Prizes for declamation and 15 for Translations, versions and theme. besides which a dozen were called out on the whole and publicly honored for exemplary conduct and industry.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101773,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101773","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b76f9bd310b05fb956aa7884790612da.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b76f9bd310b05fb956aa7884790612da.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b76f9bd310b05fb956aa7884790612da.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b76f9bd310b05fb956aa7884790612da.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:35:57+00:00","modified":"2020-08-30T04:12:34+00:00","filename":"b76f9bd310b05fb956aa7884790612da.jpg","authentication":"da961bd8cc7d6e809f88bfb30d8df0b8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_005_003_o2.jpg","size":1314550,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2218,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.054877183314965001514895703849106212146580219268798828125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034947"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034947"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034947"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b76f9bd310b05fb956aa7884790612da.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947666,"FileSize":1314550,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2218\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2218,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:50:12","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:49:47","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:49:47","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3049,"ExifImageLength":4947,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"One Fellow, Lorenzo S. Cragin jr. took the sec. prize for Declamation, the best Latin recitation from Shakespear and the best English Theme, as well as being one of the twelve Exemplars.\nMonday 26th I walked out to Harvard in the Morning and loafed round the Colleges a spell. ad then went to Mount Auburn, admired it beauties & wandered amidst it peaceful groves till one oclock, then went over to Fresh Pond and wandered there till 2 1\/2 oclock then took the cars to Charleston. There is a little Railroad fare you know to carry ice from Fresh Pond to Charleston. There are many beautiful monuments at Mount Auburn and some splendid sculptures. I was there nearly 4 hours and saw about every monument but I could have stayed 4 times as long with Pleasure. Fresh Pond is a beautiful [lace, it is a fine sheet of water, bending round round a peninsula covered with tall trees without underbrush. On it is a Public house all in the Woods, which is a favorite resort of some folks. Around the house are ninepin alleys, fine swings among the trees etc. etc. In the pond smooth pretty beach to walk upon. Fish are plenty. little boys were wading along the beach killing Alewifes with clubs and stones. Some of them had dozens. The ice works & ice houses are really worth seeing. At the Rail Road Depot are some 5 or 6 brick buildings 80 or 100 feet long 40 wide & 30 or 40 high, packed solid with ice, which many men were loading in cars. It is a cool place in there on a warm day. I told you I wrote to Charleston and called upon Miss Jersuha Holmes who is about to go into the Female Seminary. She & Mary Tower are in Charleston but I did not know that.\n\n     I did not get into Boston until too late to attend Bible Soc. Meeting, which was ?page torn in the afternoon. In the Evening I went to the Amer. Peace Soc. Meeting at Central Church Judge Jay of New York delivered the Address, which was of course good.\n\nTuesday 27th. I went to the Convention of Classical Teachers at Tremont Temple. There were not a great many there and they did not seem to do much, but  I had a chance to learn the faces of some of the ?page torn men of the Profession.\n11 or 12 I went up to see Mrs. Childs. She has particularly requested me to call again. Mrs. Child did talk - how well she can talk! Never? there was a chance her daughter put in a word edge wise; And I certainly have the merit, as, I forget who it is, says, of being of a good listener. At least ?page torn really talks well. It is a very great gift to be able to talk. I dont know how many things they wanted me to tell you. One was they expected that Aunt Dolly was dead. I dont know who she is, but they said you would. I believe they said she was Uncle Humphrey's wife or widow. At any rate they told how she was an awful infidel and did not believe anything and drank wicked rum besides, and made her Sons vagabond drunkards? And when her son Bill reformed, and improved so much that folks did not know him and ?page torn that he was a man. Then she took pains to set her tumbler of rum & sugar in his way so that he might smell it and drink again, for she said it always did do the boys good and she wished he would drink some. They lived in Orange and the boy Bill was most 40 years old.\n\n Elizabeth was much obliged for Lucy's peice of poetry, thought it very good, and had put it in her Scrap Book which she had been making with much pains, and showed it to me. Among the Autographs of the distinguished visitors, many which I noticed ?page torn written by Hannah Richard Child. Who is She? The Authoress Miss S. G. Edgerton, Lucy knows her poetry, is about to be married to Cousin Dwight Mayo. Who is he? They sent an abundance of love etc. etc. to you folks. Were going to write but preferred to send by me. Elizabeth acknowledged the receipt of Ann's letter should have written but was not able. She was in Bangor all winter last till March.  Was sick most of the time. did not expect to live. Sent for Mr. Hedge to see her etc. etc.\n I stayed there for Dinner, Mrs. Child showed me her Garden etc. etc. When I started to come away, Mrs. C. came out in the Entry and gave me a little folded peice of paper, she was going to send by letter she said, and was glad she had this chance. The paper contained two ten dollar bills! I guess I did know nothing what to say. I guess I did mumble terribly. think Mrs. C. wanted her money should do some good while she lived. Encourage interest etc. etc.\n  I knew nothing how to express my thanks and dont yet. You cant help think how necessary as well as unexpected such a money was to me. With the greatest possible prudence, I should have only $1,50 when I get home to pay my bills with. I had bought a Coat for $3,00 when I ought to have paid $1,00 for one and 2 pr of pants to wear all summer for $,75 each! I had concluded to go without any Cap or hat, or vest, or anything else I needed.\n And when I had some money, I restrained myself and bought nothing better so I brought back the $20,00. entire. My whole expenses over six days were Steamboat $2,00, Clothes etc. $4,70. Union? fees $,40, food etc. about $,50. which paid for 9 meals and all drinks fruit and other good things that I had beside. I really wanted to go into the Museum and should if I had staid another day. And to go over to East Boston and see the steam Ships too.\n However I had a very good time,  enjoyed in it finely, Saw many things I wanted too, and really did me a great deal of good, and cost hardly $3,00 which I probably saved in buying only $4,00 worth of clothes.

You must get along with and excuse mistakes as well as you can, for I will not dare to attempt reading it over I think.\n\n  I should have been glad to have staid longer in Boston, but I had no place to stop except with Humphrey. And I thought it only fair to quarter myself upon him so much; it must be inconvenient. Mrs. Albee too with her little children & 3 men folks was trying to get along without a girl. I most wish I had stayed through till Friday. Many of the Meetings through the week would be very interesting, and some other things I wanted to see . Probably too if I had wanted to Friday the Steamboat fare would have been but $.25 perhaps. but they said that the other boat Penobscot carried  1\/2 or 1\/4 or anything to get passengers.  I preferred to go in the John Marshall & dont regret it. This boat was built & put in the line by the Kennebec folks, on purpose to put the fare down reasonable, because the Proprietors of the Penobscot were unreasonable. I think the new lines, Peoples line, they call it, ought to be sustained. They are both very fast boats & there is competition for a day speed as well as passengers.  Both boats out at the same time and close together. When I went up we were but 10 hours, & coming back I suppose it amounted to Racing. Both boats probably went as fast as their engines could make them.   They started out of the harbot  about 1\/4 mile apart, and till near 10 you could hardly see that the distance between them increased a length. In the morning  Penobscot was 2 or  3 miles behind, though her Capt. had sworn \"big oaths\" the day before that he would pass. The trip to Both was made by J. Marshall in 8 hours 53 minutes!  I went to Brunswick, got there 8 or 9, came back, hungry and sleepy, for the boat was not a very good place to sleep, in her hurrying, so, though it was perfectly calm.\n                  I have got a room at Mrs. Graves where our club is. She could not very well board me but offered every convenience for boarding myself. I took the hint, bought a loaf of bread, 4 or 5 pounds of best pilot bread, a pound of cheese. She supplies me with some lapses? and a quart of milk per day, and I have every prospect of living as independent as you please for a week, till I can get into College again. no studies or Bell to ? make afraid, nothing to do but read, write, sleep etc. & grow fat.\n\n[right-hand side] I brought home $27,60 so I shall not want that $5,00 that I begged for so hard in my last letters, you know. I am hoping this will get there before you have many any effort to send it to me. I suppose $11,00 or $18,00 will pay my bill at the beginning of term, except the regular Term bill which can wait at 6 per cent interest. This week I guess will not cost me more than $1,50 if it does that, and I shall have $8,00 or $10,00 to pay the initiation fees to the Societies, buy my books, and so forth. I think I shall get along very comfortably through the term. Then if I can find any thing to do from Sept. to March to earn some money - then - try and find me a school or something to do.\n\n The season is about two weeks earlier in Mass. than it is here. About Boston the grass looks finely, heating? out some, Lilacs, Apple and Horse Chestnut trees, here just blossoming, blossomed there a fortnight since. At Milo I suppose it has just thawed out and people just begun their spring work. At Boston I once walked down Wheeler's court, same door that I remembered. T. Thaxter on it. On the steps played a pretty little curly-haired girl & boy. Mr. Bush has some pretty children.\n Stone place I seen a new churn. Simple six sided box, Set in a frame, with a crank to turn it, and I should think cheaper and easier better than one like yours. It is really astonishing to see how Boston has grown & is growing, and the cities which have sprung up around it, for Charleston, Cambridge, Roxbury, South & East Boston, might be called cities. It is but a few years comparatively before Boston will be the largest City in America. New York can page torn in the page torn greatness. Any decent man, young man, must be shiftless who cant make page torn now:  I guess you will be glad to see that I am going to close this letter. I hope you will write very particularly. I wish you would send letters as this, and let me know all about you and your affairs at home there, of every kind, you cannot think how much it would interest me. This letter deserves an answer. the time spent in writing, not thinking is something. Do write to I.S.

It will \ndo me harm to have some letters written before hand ready to send.\nBy the way, as postage will then be less than half as much, it\nwill be well to write about twice as many letters; I hope you will bear\nthis suggestion in mind, all of you at home, and write to me.\nI am getting along pretty comfortably this term, for so far.\nThe principal excitement has been about our College Societies.\nI am an Athenaean.

I was extremely puzzled to decide.\nMy Chum was also Athenaean when he came here and came from Waterville, but he\nby immense fishing was finally coaxed off & joined Peucinian, though he did not\ndecide till the very day.

It seemed he would not\nhave a great deal for me to do, and could not afford to pay a\ngreat deal.

I arrived here Friday night, and shall commence my school tomorrow, Monday Morning.\nI suppose you will want to hear the whole story, as usual. In the first place, then; Our Yearly Examination, was on Wed. Aug. 27th at which time I was almost sick, having a very bad cold, and having been out a good deal the two nights before, being the Prize Declamations at the Junior & Sophomore Exhibitions. It was a very cold rainy day, We were obliged to sit in the Old Chemical Lecture room, hardest seats in the world most, for 8 or 9 hours two hours and more at a time without moving. I felt bad enough, I assure you: It was a much harder Examination than usual besides. However I got along through the Latin and Greek and French, very well indeed, much better than I expected in comparison with this, and considering the peculiar 'state of my feelings' at the time.  But in the Mathematics - O Tempora! O Mores! or any thing else! How I did get screwed! I had expected to show to advantage in Mathematics, if nothing else. I believe I am considered one of the best Mathematicians in the Class, I have certainly studied the Mathematics of the year as thoroughly and understandingly as any one of the class.  But at that time the violence of my head ache totally incapacitated me for thinking. Old Smyth (probably relying upon my ability) gave me a kind of theoretical demonstration from the Spring term studies; I had not thought of it recently, At an other time I could have thought it out, but there, I could form no idea of it; and was obliged to get something else assigned to me  which I performed.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101789,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101789","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b9105db4c65579be03b4a32c3ef80fea.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b9105db4c65579be03b4a32c3ef80fea.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b9105db4c65579be03b4a32c3ef80fea.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b9105db4c65579be03b4a32c3ef80fea.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:36:20+00:00","modified":"2020-08-30T19:30:32+00:00","filename":"b9105db4c65579be03b4a32c3ef80fea.jpg","authentication":"0e17d8a4556adb78da153f27ab9445b7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_009_002_o2.jpg","size":1690308,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2862,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.054685534591194996656415838742759660817682743072509765625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035310"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035310"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035310"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b9105db4c65579be03b4a32c3ef80fea.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947667,"FileSize":1690308,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2862\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2862,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:50:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:53:10","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:53:10","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2975,"ExifImageLength":3741,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I do'nt care much about it, though it provoked me some at the time to see others, who know almost nothing at all of the years studies, pass off smoothly, while I stopped.

Mr.    Cal. Baptist, young, called a very smart man, pretty large Society I guess\nThen the 'Old Parish', Congregational, Minister a Mr Eddy, youngish man from Conn. Successor to Parson Greely.  Society now rather weak. The folks here are mostly Universalists, in fact, it is one of their Strongholds But, by good Providence, I am thrown a little among Congregationalists. Talbot, the Agent is one. I board at Old Deacon Dresser's, a fine place I am thinking. Family, Old Deacon, his Son, & Son's wife fine woman, two little children. Moreover, 5 or 6 scholars from other parts of the town are coming here to board.  Turner has some advantages.  Good soil Sands set apart by the Proprietors, School fund $200,00 per annum employed to sustain two such schools as mine, every fall, different parts of the town. Ministerial fund $350, per annum. Enough to support one minister. Always has till lately belonged to the Old Parish, source of much town contention, lately by legislative enaction, every voter decides to whom his part shall go.  So the Congregational Minister gets only about $40,00 of it.  rather a small share.\nI did not know any but Catholics opposed the Bible in Schools. Universalists here, are said to Bates, Minister says he wants no one to teach his children to read in the Bible but himself, and I suppose he rules things here. Do you suppose the man will rule me? ha! he! I guess not! He lives next house to the school house. I board about 1\/2 mile from School house\nI got me a coat made at Brunswick, whole cost $13,00. It is a $4,00 broadcloth, Black. Just in fashion, sets neatly, perfect love of a coat! Most a pity to carry that and my splendid cloak way off up to Turner. Turner though I hear is celebrated for its 'Women', its pretty gals! My school will be most all of that sort. I expect they are terribly 'unsophisticated' though.  I also gave $3,00 for a hat, got a neat one too, & $3,12 1\/2 for a pair of pants. Boots I must have before long. I got a watch of Carey & Co.

Sept. 28th 1845\nI received your letter last Tuesday night Sept. 23d and with a good deal of pleasure, I assure you. I have now been in Turner three weeks & more, and that is the only letter I have received in the time! at which fact I hardly know whether to be most vexed, or provoked, or homesick. However, I find myself so pleasantly situated here that I have concluded not to be homesick, I digest my spleen as well as I can, and revenge myself for my vexation by writing half a dozen letters to different friends, since I have been here, and live upon hope of sometime receiving some letters in return.\nI hardly see what has got into Brother Joseph: he has been a first rate Correspondent all summer, but the last letter I received from him bears date more than a month since; I answered it before I left Bowdoin, and have written him one letter since I have been here, but he does not write. I suppose time seems longer to me being in a new place so.\nThat letter from Milo really did me good, in every respect. Lucy is a glorious hand at writing letters, I only wish she would practice it a little oftener. I should like to hear from some of the rest too. I could not tell from Lucy's letter whether Ann had established a private school at Boston or Bangor. I should like to know!

Will answer it soon  The complaint of rotten potatoes appears universal. They say it is not so bad just here as most every where else about, but here about half are rotten & the rest rotting fast. That is of the mangoes, others rot not so fast quite Charles is late about his grain. Most all the grain, I guess they do not raise a great deal, was harvest when I came here 3 weeks since, all cut, some few stooks standing out. People cutting corn then & yet, digging potatoes.\nMy health is good. Perhaps I eat too many apples for one who has not been accustomed to much fruit lately; Still I am well, though they say I do not fat up any yet, as I was intending to. You know I always have grown poor teaching. But this school, great as it is, besides being High, is not hard. I believe I never taught a school which fatigued me so little as this. It really is not much if any harder than good hard day's work. The government is exactly nothing. There is none of that constant, Argus, Argus yet vigilance, watching small scholars, eyes & mind constantly stretched which worries 7 vexes me to death in a common school.\nIt is a most noble school. About 60 scholars now. 70 at first, some had to leave for lack of room.  I hear about 20 classes per diem, ought to have nearly 1\/2 hour each. I crowd them into 7 hours. I have about as good classes in most branches as was usual at Foxcroft Academy. Mathematics better, 2 classes in Latin. Virgil & Reader. 3 classes in French, 12 scholars, 2 of them have read more French than I have though my Education, in that is complete! Burritts Astronomy 12. Philosophy most 20, Chemistry, History, Geometry, Geography &c. Also Upham & Abercrombie. Large classes receiving Smiths' & ?, Welch's Arithmetic. Colburn's, Baileys & Smyths Algebra, Smyths', about 12, first rate, many of them been about through it before.  In fact I believe the school would average more forward & better school than Foxcroft Academy, the Scholars here have had better advantages than most who attend there.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101796,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101796","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5d3594b5ddeb3bb82324ced056430703.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5d3594b5ddeb3bb82324ced056430703.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5d3594b5ddeb3bb82324ced056430703.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5d3594b5ddeb3bb82324ced056430703.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:36:30+00:00","modified":"2020-08-31T01:51:55+00:00","filename":"5d3594b5ddeb3bb82324ced056430703.jpg","authentication":"6730816d395bc5257c2958f24c8d1d19","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_011_003_o2.jpg","size":1952347,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2897,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.06240002429077300127868710433176602236926555633544921875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035358"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035358"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035358"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5d3594b5ddeb3bb82324ced056430703.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947667,"FileSize":1952347,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2897\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2897,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:51:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:53:58","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:53:58","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3041,"ExifImageLength":3778,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I suppose I have been extremely fortunate here, was at first, people took a notion to like me, I dont know why. It is a little strange too. You see people here are most all Universalists, far the largest and most influential part of the town, though I happen to be placed among what few Congregationalists there are. Agent is a Congregationalist & I board at the Deacon's.\n\nThere has been great opposition made even to reading the Bible, it has not been practiced in any of the town or high schools for some years. I was in a real quandary, knew not what to do. Folks here, where I board & other religious people say that they should have advised me, for my own interest & success, before hand, before witnessing the success of the experiment; to have let it all go.\n However the first day I only organized the school, did nothing. The Sec. day, partly I suppose from ignorance, partly, perhaps from my natural stupidity & obstinacy, first prefacing some remarks I went on and opened the school by reading a chapter in the Bible and a short prayer merely asking a blessing, and so continue. I expect it astonished folks some.\nHowever, the success was beyond every ones most sanguine expectations. It took people a little by surprise. no one thought of such a thing in any body I suppose. However the Scholars Mostly a great heap of girls, had all taken a notion to like me beforehand, partly perhaps because I looked so much like Seavey, the last Master who was extremely popular here. At any rate no one found any fault, every one liked the master better & better. Of Course, that very thing made one part of the people my strong friends & supporters for the first thing, and, it  seems, has gained me no ill will from any one. The Great Universalist Minister Mr. Bates, People at Milo have heard of him, he has been all over the State, is one of their very big guns, lives next house to the school house.  His two daughters go to school, and most splendid scholars, in Latin, French, Abercrombie, Mathematics etc., much interested in Studies  apparently. Mr. Bates has shown considerable interest in the school. Much please at my introducing Burritt's Astronomy, & getting a large class in it. He appears to be a great, big, sound headed, good natural sort of a man, with a big tongue.\nMr. Eddy, the Congregational Minister here, I am not inclined to like very well. He is a small, prissy, sharp, sort of a man, meddling in every little thing & very set in his way, just about and opposite to Mr. Parker, I might guess, not very likely to conciliate, I reckon. I do not consider him talented, though he was thought by the people here when they got him here, year ago. I believe they would have done better to have settled that little Mr. Southworth, perhaps you remember preached at Sebec & Foxcroft year or two ago, and who preached here a month or two on trial.  I like the idea of settling a young minister, in such a place, both to have the benefit of his improvement in preaching, and also give him a chance to, as he matures, adapt himself to his people & situation instead of, having himself & character already formed, being obliged to fit a people & place to himself which is not always quite so easy. Today He preached very energetically for him, on the perseverance of saints. I did not like it. I believe I am a Calvinist, but if the doctrine must be expressed in that way,  I do not wonder that it is a hard saying for many.\n                      He exchanged last Sabbath with Mr. Butler, the Cal. Bap. Minister. He is a little boy apparently, has preached two years & I believe is not yet 20! He is really very talented I say. He intend to leave off preaching and get an Education soon, if he does he will make a smart man & powerful preacher some day I believe. He ought to he has talents which it is his duty to cultivate, and I do not think Wesley's the best way always.\n I rather think I shall engage a Winter school, about here, somewhere, can very well I suppose. not probably get but $18.00 per month though. Wages here are low. 16 is as high as is often paid in the largest schools. These High schools turn out lots of Teachers you see, which reduce wages all round, with the 1\/2 doz Academics not far off.\nI guess I can get $100,00 by Spring term, if Providence prospers, & perhaps if they want me, I'd better come back here next fall. So, if I have my health & prosperity I can get through College, in some sort, honorably or not is another thing. I wish I could have been in College this fall, & money enough, & a little more head to back up besides.  I suppose that I have certain friends in College who are determined that I shall be Pres. of Ath. next year. It might probably be some advantage to me, & perhaps a fit object of Ambition, if I were Ambitious","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101797,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101797","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/42be09d72e8b44801fd58452593df528.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/42be09d72e8b44801fd58452593df528.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/42be09d72e8b44801fd58452593df528.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/42be09d72e8b44801fd58452593df528.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:36:31+00:00","modified":"2020-08-31T02:08:29+00:00","filename":"42be09d72e8b44801fd58452593df528.jpg","authentication":"6bee4e289b3dd3b80c656c66fc7cb338","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_011_004_o2.jpg","size":1386738,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2920,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04397317351598199752782392124572652392089366912841796875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035404"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035404"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035404"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"42be09d72e8b44801fd58452593df528.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947667,"FileSize":1386738,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2920\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2920,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:51:10","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:54:04","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:54:04","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3011,"ExifImageLength":3712,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"??

You can hardly imagine the good it does one to receive letters from home, when one is so far off, in a strange land, though perhaps I hardly ought to say among strangers; for I have got acquainted here considerable, more than I am apt to. I have certainly succeeded very well here, so far; at least I have, I think likely, about the greatest High School, ever taught here in Turner, and certainly none ever got along more smoothly. It would amaze a common teacher to see my school, I reckon The school house contains two rooms, and the school being so very large we have taken a couple of planks out of the partition & the scholars sit in either room part, indiscriminately. Besides every one has full liberty to do as they please & go as they please. No one asks leave to pass from one seat or one room to another, or out doors, or or any where or any thing else.  Every one does as themselves please in every thing; and of course, being in two different rooms, & so many of them, they have every opportunity, the materials too must of course be discordant, among so many from all sorts of districts & all sorts of families, there are of course all sorts of romping girls & bad boys, boys perhaps who never behaved well before in their lives, certainly not in school. And yet it is a good school, in every respect, every one well disposed and doing their best apparently; all perfectly united. All agreed to like their Teacher, & one another, and improve their time.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101799,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101799","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/a990435553dc245b88ba5df672097598.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/a990435553dc245b88ba5df672097598.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/a990435553dc245b88ba5df672097598.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a990435553dc245b88ba5df672097598.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:36:34+00:00","modified":"2020-08-29T15:53:33+00:00","filename":"a990435553dc245b88ba5df672097598.jpg","authentication":"e10fb61876cb3d6ef55d0eb1a46d17a2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_012_002_o2.jpg","size":1622697,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2860,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.052534867909867999369311064583598636090755462646484375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035418"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035418"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035418"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a990435553dc245b88ba5df672097598.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947667,"FileSize":1622697,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2860\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2860,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:51:15","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:54:18","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:54:18","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2969,"ExifImageLength":3737,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"It is not even a noisy school, though there is no regulation against Whispering; more than any thing else.

I am dreading really a good deal my next remove: this is such an excellent place here, it really vexes me to leave it, and to think then of plunging again among perfect strangers, & all the uncertainties thereof,  I close school here in a fortnight more; I expect to teach this winter in the town of Richmond, perhaps 20 miles from here, on the Kennebec river, below Augusta.  I know nothing about it, but the representations of my Friend Peavey, who procured it me, page torn introduced me to Turner; He has taught it 3 years.  It is a small school, very forward, always paid higher wages than the large schools about; and then lengthen it out by private subscription. School money would never make more than 6 or 8 weeks, but they never have less than three months.  The only ill of it is they wish it to commence for a whole fortnight after this closes, which is too bad.  I dont know what to do with the time, whether to stay & spend Thanksgiving in Turner, or go to Brunswick, or, as Friend Welch, who teaches 'tother Grammar School' here desires go over to his place at Monmouth and spend the time.

I shall send that money to Joseph immediately.

Dec. 4th, 1845\nDear Mother\nIt is Thanksgiving day, and I feel really disposed to write a letter to Milo - to Mother. though I believe I have written at least once since, receiving any letter from there, besides one or two to Bangor. What a stormy day it is! How natural it is, at any time, for one's thoughts to wander away, from the present & the here, to - to Milo, and especially so this particular time of Thanksgiving day. Oh! if I could only set down by the old stove, and have a good old fashioned talk, with you, and Lucy, and Brother Charles; who, I suppose, compose your family at Milo now. I suppose I have enough to be thankful for now, but it seems that would add some to my happiness, if it did not to my gratitude.\nYou don't know how much I have thought about home, and the People there, within a few days, since my school closed here.  I suppose, too, you are thinking occasionally of the absent ones, and especially so today. However, I suppose you are all getting along comfortably at Milo, as usual, in about the same old sort of way; and, as for myself, you know, of course, that I am comfortable, as I always am, wherever I may be. And, at the present time, I am certainly surrounded by every thing, except home, to make a person comfortable and happy. although I have nothing to do hardly.\n[Written up the left side and across the top sideways]\nNow I really think you ought to write me some good letters in return for this and and the last one I sent I believe I do rather more than my share of writing letters for the family. There are as many as seven of you down East at Milo and Bangor, who ought to write. While I am here all alone. Yet I guess I write letters full as often and as much as any one writes to me. Which is, you see, sevenfold as much on the average. though to be sure, some of you seven re not very good letter writers, that is, if my experience is a fair example. Charles never writes I believe. I wish he would. letter writing is an excellent thing for the mind of any one I believe. I dont know but Eliab is going to be just like C that respect. I hope Lucy is not losing her 'gift' in that respect. Do write to me, frequently & much.

I hardly know whether from an odd habit I have got into of refusing all invitations; or because I felt like getting to the place that feels most like home. \nI closed my school here last Friday, Nov. 28th, a week ago tomorrow, and was then expecting to leave here, Sat. last, or the next Monday, but, as I had a pretty good home, and very kind invitations to stop here, I finally concluded to stay here a spell, rather than go to Brunswick - where I could be doing nothing, and must be at considerable expense, or than to go over to Monmouth, or Hallowell with Friends Welch or Peavey, who kindly invited me so to do, and make a home with them for the week, as I was almost entirely unacquainted with their families, and should feel as if I were putting them to trouble, rather than going home, though perhaps I might have been vexed with them, had the case been 'transposed', and they refused to go home with me; so I availed myself of my priveliged capacity of saying 'guess I better not', and took the easiest course for a lazy person, that of maintaining my 'status quo', and so here I am, at Royal Whitman's, Turner.\nI guess there is not much sense in what I have written so you need not be puzzled if you can not find it.

Still I have enjoyed myself finely this fall.  The fact is, a beneficent Providence has kindly formed me for enjoyment, for taking pleasure in whatever my hands find to do, and in whatever I do I find pleasure, more so perhaps then in some things I am sometimes obliged to think. and I doubt not I shall enjoy myself, whatever be my circumstances.

Perhaps, I ought not to have written such a mess of stuff, as this letter contains, to put a lot of foolish ideas in your head, that rarely find place in mine.\nI don't know but these are rather an evasion of the question. I fully agree with your remark about decision. I certainly feel the need of some such 'definite purpose in view, as a stimulant sense of duty I expect is too much lacking,  to exertion, something to call into real exercise all the power. It is essential to a really valuable success. I really feel its lack. But - how?

Gardiner, Maine\n\nI am teaching School in Richmond, in which town there","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101810,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101810","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5c80a4f88c6c59142ed80c7e4192d5d6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5c80a4f88c6c59142ed80c7e4192d5d6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5c80a4f88c6c59142ed80c7e4192d5d6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5c80a4f88c6c59142ed80c7e4192d5d6.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:36:49+00:00","modified":"2020-08-31T04:34:24+00:00","filename":"5c80a4f88c6c59142ed80c7e4192d5d6.jpg","authentication":"0694329c15041434e8925a8d771b2681","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_014_002_o2.jpg","size":1623158,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2846,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.052808294942870002974810716978026903234422206878662109375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035601"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035601"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035601"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5c80a4f88c6c59142ed80c7e4192d5d6.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947668,"FileSize":1623158,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2846\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2846,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:51:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:56:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:56:01","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3011,"ExifImageLength":3808,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"are two Post Offices, but one of them is 7 miles from me, the other 4 miles, and just about no communication with either place.\n\n           Gardiner is 6 or 7 miles distant, but the communication is frequent & easy.\n           Moreover J.

I had almost begun to think that you had forgotten me or something else, it seemed such an age since I had heard from you. It was really just about two months, - almost.\nYou asked me if I had heard of such & such thing, & events, The fact is I have heard of nothing, a month or two, or perhaps two or three months ago, Joseph casually mentioned, in a letter to me, that that they had had a freshet at Milo, & drowned the calves, but he supposed I had heard about it.\u00a0!!!\nI was almost vexed at your letter besides, it was so small, so meager: one small sheet was partly covered two just such sheets as that would have weighed much less than half an ounce, I guess three would have passed single: and how much might have been written on those 8 or 11 pages! Why could not that Sister Lucy who 'really wanted to write' have thought of that?

I shall earn this term by building fires etc. etc. some $15. or 20.00, which will keep the term bill along somewhat. Somehow I expect to have some money the first of June to pay for Board bills & incidentals, say $25.00.\nIf Charles can help me to it - good, if not perhaps I can borrow it of Joseph as I did last summer. If I have my health, & the blessing of Providence, and  do not get too deep into Society Expenses, I shall be better as well off next spring as this.\nPerhaps, under all most favorable aspects,  and uniform good fortune & health, might get through College by only borrowing $100,00 to pay my Graduating Expenses!\n\n I have been extremely economical: can't tell for the future. May yet spend $50.00 for term for societies.  I cannot be mean.  I think I have done pretty well in dress. $60, or $70,00 is allowed per annum to dress a young man.  I have spent $60,00 in 18 months. Had hardly any thing at first. Now can dress decently, pretty good suit of clothes, Cloak etc.  Do write.

A.B. C. F. M. It has been remarked that great mean are not always wise. It is still more true that worldly wisdom sometimes carries great men out of the path of simple straight forward truth & right. They become too nice to see that it is the best policy. Expediency is a great God. At meeting of the A.B.C.F.M. last Fall, the Great Men, Dr. Woods of Andover, Dea Beecher, Stowe & Anderson etc. big guns, were set to make a report on the great Slavery question, much agitating the country, & threatening to divide the Board.  It was a great duty. They felt it. The interests of the country & the world were on them. They were Great men, mighty men; but their souls were not big enough They feared the face of man, trusted not in God, and bowed down to the God Expediency.  They made a report. It was a master peice. It spake of Organic & inorganic sins; a cunning theory. To the Northern Man it was an Antislavery document: to the Southern Man it sanctioned Slavery in toto. It was designed to unite all parties, the plan apparently succeeded. The board were, it was said unanimous. The lesser lights dared not shine. But - the craven northerners dodged.  They probably feared Expediency also. At any rate, out of some hundreds of Northern & Eastern men present, only a dozen or two signed the report.

But all will not do: truth must prevail.  The yearly Class Election of Orator & Poet in the Sophomore Class took place last Friday. \n\nThe candidates for Orator were the \u03a8\u03a5 Stevens, the big gun of the Class, the great man of \u03a8\u03a5 and my good friend & Brother Case of Levant.  It was hard contested and great excitement. One would think the very existence of \u03a8\u03a5 depended upon Stevens election. Even the Seniors interested themselves in it, electioneered for them. On our side, the Sophomores worked it out for themselves, in all ?houses? Case was Elected. 18 to 17 One majority.  It was justly considered a victory, little to be sure, but a beginning. It is secretly called an omen that Metcalf will be next President of the Athenaean Society! \n\n  The defeat did not set very well upon the \u03a8\u03a5. They made a terrible outcry, in their anger brought a raving charge of Lying etc. against a \u0394\u039a\u0395. He defended himself calmly, and with so much true courage that they could not get him to fight, and finally they were obliged to take back and apologize! It was rich. They over did themselves.\n                I would write to Uncle Joseph, if  I knew how. How I should like to go to Mass.  Probably I shall not go to 'Oregon', if the Mormons do, at least till they die off. \n\nAs for the Doctor project I was in earnest then, though in truth, I am so busy since, I do not think about it.

Charles, I suppose, told you how I was left by Clark, because he could not get any horse to come with; and also how he carried me most over to Dexter, and then consigned me to Esq.

I do not believe he finished sheep shearing the next day.\n  There was no Stage went from Dexter until Thursday noon, 42 hours. I should have gone right on foot, but I hated to leave my trunk behind, for it is not a direct route to Waterville by Stage. two crop routes, up to Skowegan, & then down to Waterville, making near 60 miles, while it is 38 40 by direct route. If I left trunk & come by Stage, it would only get to Waterville Friday noon, & I should be lucky if it ever got from there to Brunswick. Besides I found that there was very much direct communication from Dexter to Waterville, chances to go or send very often.

They were very glad to see any one from Foxcroft. Stopped there to Supper. Mr. Sewall happened to be obliged to harness his horse, and insisted upon carrying me half way up to Brunswick.  I did not want him to, but I suppose it was a good thing. You see he is to lazy to harness the horse often, and it really suffers for exercise.

You should rather talk to some of the rest of your children about being careful. I am careful naturally, as well as habitually.\n  How in the world is Charles going to get all his hay? And only that little boy to help him. I should think he must have more help or it would take him till next December.\n Only got in 8 loads! That though was the 21st only.\n  I do not hardly believe he will succeed in selling his colt, after all the business.\n Well if I got to Turner, I believe I shall do as every body else does.  Tic. Get suit of clothes and what ever else I want on credit and let it slide. College, board, and all bills together. Many have let their bills run for year or more.\n  Moreover my credit here is pretty good, for contrary to all custom, I have gone on the cash principle with every thing but College Term Bills.\nIf I am not here, of course they will wait for me.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101839,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101839","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ee241f4fb5ec60562a49bd5beb5d3223.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ee241f4fb5ec60562a49bd5beb5d3223.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ee241f4fb5ec60562a49bd5beb5d3223.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ee241f4fb5ec60562a49bd5beb5d3223.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:37:30+00:00","modified":"2020-09-01T22:00:41+00:00","filename":"ee241f4fb5ec60562a49bd5beb5d3223.jpg","authentication":"5dc2cf4137d33bb07edfcbcee4aa8c8b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_159_007_003_o2.jpg","size":1847281,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2843,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.060163396777008999738445282901011523790657520294189453125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["232905"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["232905"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["232905"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ee241f4fb5ec60562a49bd5beb5d3223.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947669,"FileSize":1847281,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2843\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2843,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 11:56:28","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:29:05","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:29:05","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":6,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3166,"ExifImageLength":4008,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"You ask if there are not many trials in being treated with contempt for the lack of the 'Almighty-dollar', of course, much; but not so much among Students themselves.

I believe I have written at least a dozen full letters to 'the family,' within eight weeks past. Enough surely, without they were better! In answer the them, I have received in all five!  hardly the usual proportion.  This too in term when I have had so very much of every thing to attend to, of my own business and studies and every bodie's else. I have not even had time to write my regular College themes. until three or four days past, when taking advantage of a little respite and two or three 'adjourns,' I have elaborated about a dozen solid pages of Theme.\n However I owe an apology for writing letters home so carelessly as I do. When one writes a letter home, in a hurry, the mind wearied by study and thoughtful writing, he is most apt, of not more careful than I usually am, to merely scrible of what comes up first, a mass of words, without much thought or sense.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101841,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101841","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f8b54cfbe8ced0c582888a0171aeb933.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f8b54cfbe8ced0c582888a0171aeb933.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f8b54cfbe8ced0c582888a0171aeb933.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f8b54cfbe8ced0c582888a0171aeb933.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:37:32+00:00","modified":"2020-09-02T00:21:52+00:00","filename":"f8b54cfbe8ced0c582888a0171aeb933.jpg","authentication":"be72b4a8e421dd5b63f6d018494c22fc","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_159_008_002_o2.jpg","size":1957960,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2895,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.06262265719951400078091552359182969667017459869384765625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["232927"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["232927"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["232927"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f8b54cfbe8ced0c582888a0171aeb933.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947669,"FileSize":1957960,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2895\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2895,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 11:56:38","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:29:27","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:29:27","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3189,"ExifImageLength":3965,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I received a day or two since a letter from Joseph from his \"quiet chamber, surrounded by books etc.\", filled with grave speculations and 'well founded opinions' on various subjects, and then, crowded into the last line, these words.  \"It is the Erysipelas, you must keep it in a horizontal position & constantly bathed in spirit & water said Dr. McR. when I showed him my swelled legs.

I wrote that I should probably go to Turner before Commencement . I have had that school on my hands ever since last Fall but this Summer, went up and made arrangements by which I could go there & leave just when I chose. having another supply my place. I then expected to have a school here in Brunswick beginning in October, and so go to Turner before Comm. and stay six weeks first. But I found myself obliged to stay at College until after Commencement, partly to help entertain company here from other Colleges, and partly to decide more exactly about the schools. Last week the Topsham Board decided to have their school school begin six weeks earlier, that is tomorrow, and continue five or six months.\n[left-hand side] I guess I am in debt in Brunswick or should be in three weeks more than $100.00! $60.00 on term bills and must have a new coat etc. soon $16.00 Must dress better here than off somewhere you know. However I guess my creditors must wait as others do until I get the money Where shall I get $100.00 next August? To quit College upon.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101851,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/101851","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e08465c3a6b5a8dc6465797525a7b4e9.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e08465c3a6b5a8dc6465797525a7b4e9.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e08465c3a6b5a8dc6465797525a7b4e9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e08465c3a6b5a8dc6465797525a7b4e9.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:37:47+00:00","modified":"2020-09-02T03:06:39+00:00","filename":"e08465c3a6b5a8dc6465797525a7b4e9.jpg","authentication":"514ad52eee328ffd08b7b0837427236e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_159_011_002_o2.jpg","size":1849272,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2813,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.06087056128293200085721537107019685208797454833984375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233034"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233034"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["233034"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e08465c3a6b5a8dc6465797525a7b4e9.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947670,"FileSize":1849272,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2813\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2813,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 11:57:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:30:34","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:30:34","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3085,"ExifImageLength":3948,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"So I must give up going to Turner at all, or else lose my situation here for all Winter. \n\nFortunately, I found a good teacher to take my place there, and packed him off for Turner yesterday So I take up my quarters in Topsham, probably till next Spring.

It is no small advantage to a literary man to have the first reading of all these things.

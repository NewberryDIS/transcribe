I have been tryingunderlined to prepare a composition, also writing to Ann about some book etc. to day; rather worldly employment to be sure, but I am hurried, there is great scrabble, in school now about review and preparation for examinations?  There is one thing which I want a little advice about.  I expect that James ? Walker would be very glad of an invite to go up to Milo with me and make hay a spell.  Now the thing is would it do?  considering etc.  He would have the tactunderlined to see whether he wanted I spose, but I think he would like to come if he were urged a little.  I should not have written now except for this, as I wrote so lately  Somehow I thought Charles did not look quite so well, healthy, as usual, when he was down here.  Is his health good now? I did not have a chance to see or speak to him, hardly at all, I don't know whether he noticed me in morning, or not, I was up to the farm with Mr. W. and James, hoeing potatoes; but he took the Centre St. so I could not speak to him.  I have not hardly concluded yet, whether to run home and go to haying before school is finished or stay and take the consequences at the Examination. I have been trying to hammer out a composition for a about a week.  As I had nothing to write about and nothing to write about I could not make out much.  I have been trying to espatch up something, by taking a peice out one book and a slice out of another, a line here and a sentence there, twisting it every way, but I fear they will convict me of Plagiarism  I could not do any better no harm though as I can see","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101713,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101713","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/adb7d2e25d87811a93a37f8df991f6bf.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/adb7d2e25d87811a93a37f8df991f6bf.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/adb7d2e25d87811a93a37f8df991f6bf.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/adb7d2e25d87811a93a37f8df991f6bf.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:34:32+00:00","modified":"2020-08-27T02:36:02+00:00","filename":"adb7d2e25d87811a93a37f8df991f6bf.jpg","authentication":"ce7e6f74854dd953fe23385bf0a071a8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_155_007_002_o2.jpg","size":1164916,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2183,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049410257715342},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["033846"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["033846"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["033846"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"adb7d2e25d87811a93a37f8df991f6bf.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947663,"FileSize":1164916,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2183\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2183,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:47:50","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:38:46","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:38:46","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"SubSecTimeOriginal":51,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3018,"ExifImageLength":4976,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Mr. C.W.

I do not study History as yet but think I shall when the class gets to English History, as I feel a great lacking in that reflect.\nI guess that the Scientific class Book that they have here is not the one Amos is acquainted with, this is an advanced work, goes entirely further than Cornstocks, it takes Natural Philosophy in it  widest sense - Mon 16th I found at the steamboat office this morn a bundle for me, containing two school books for me, a signing sentences for Ann, and 3 letters, 2 of them from Mr. Bush.  I will send Josephs and Mothers' as soon as I can with this etc.  The freight was $5,25.  The book are just the thing, I wanted.  I want to know what Ann gave for them.  The other scholars have to give $1,12half for the reader here!  I expect we shall have to fly round to keep along when we study in the Reader too.  They say it is awful hard.\n5'O'clock Coming home from school tonight, I perceived Mr. Ellis, wandering about in search of the habitation of me F. Addams. 1 Kenneth place and directed him to it, and I meant to get him carry up my bundle of letters etc.\nI am losing my required flesh and strength fast already line unclear because of crease\nI certainly can't enjoy myself as well as at work.  I shall study till next spring if health permits and then you see.  You must all write.  Ann must write to me, and all of you.  I feel almost like an exile!!  Don't think I am discouraged on however or dissatisfied with my situation for it is not so intolerant - but\nBangor Isaac\nSept. 15 '39","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101719,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101719","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/33fe70a9afc9134b56d1e7314bf4d911.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/33fe70a9afc9134b56d1e7314bf4d911.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/33fe70a9afc9134b56d1e7314bf4d911.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/33fe70a9afc9134b56d1e7314bf4d911.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:34:40+00:00","modified":"2020-08-27T02:52:27+00:00","filename":"33fe70a9afc9134b56d1e7314bf4d911.jpg","authentication":"8c173234b787c250f278ce9656e41f20","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_155_010_001_o2.jpg","size":1592875,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2887,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051087088994086},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["033926"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["033926"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["033926"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"33fe70a9afc9134b56d1e7314bf4d911.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947663,"FileSize":1592875,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2887\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2887,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:48:04","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:39:26","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:39:26","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3114,"ExifImageLength":3882,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Bangor Cot 2d 1839  Sunday noon\n\nDear Mother\nI got here as Eliab has told you when you read this.

The girl is quite young (note the good old one who cannot come yet) and without exactly asking I have found out that Mrs. W would not want any addition to the family but I think Lucy had better come and board at Mr. Cutlers, they would probably board here a little cheaper if she did her own washing and perhaps might pay part in produce at his store and C. take the money instead.  She would learn as much there about behavior company as here, and with regarding to introducing her time out of school, she must learn to have decision of character and independence enough to do what is right and proper without being led by others; a most useful lesson and one that can be gained best by experience.  I should have gone on up to Mr. Cutler's this afternoon if it had just raised, but there is not doubt but they will take her and she must get ready as soon as she can.  I shall send word as soon as I have been there and she had better come as soon as possible afterward, so as to be here as near the beginning of the term as she can.  Well, what kind of a school will she go to?  Why, the committee who came in yesterday, called it a new select school for girls, in telling the scholars (and teacher too I suppose) how much they expected of them.  It consists of 44 girls, from 10 to 15 mostly, no boys, so you see it is just the school for Lucy and if she comes with a determination to study she can improve much and be a help to me.  I should rather she would go to Mr. Pomroy' meeting and perhaps I can arrange it so as to have her in our S.S in that case she would attending meeting here in the forenoon, though that meeting is as good as this.\n\n I want my thick shoes to work in the garden with.\n[top upside down] You must write often.

I said that she did nicely.  How did it turn out?  This term she has got, I suppose the very best school, taught by a female in the city!!  A New Select School!!! consisting of girls only; just about the right number; just about the right age; and moreover, just the very place for Lucy!!!!!  The next thing is, I suppose, for Lucy to get here as soon as possible.  It seems as if you would need her at home this Summer, but I think it is altogether too good a chance to be lost, or found every day either, especially if she can get boarded at Mrs Cutlers for 7\/6 per week.  Can't you get little Olive again this Summer?  It is a pity that Charles cannot improve this nice early spring, so as to get his crops in good season, and for once in the May, get fairly beforehand.  He ought to have had some of his wheat sown before this rain today: but I suppose he has not.  I fear he will conclude that his 6 days time and fuss spent for 10, dollars worth of hayseed, that he wanted to sow himself, was ......, not quite wasted, - but this applied.  It is so dark that I can write no longer.\nI have sold the smallest box of butter for 14 cts per pound, 12 quarter pound $1,71 I have enquired somewhat, but do not think I shall be able to sell the seeds.  It is too late, every body has got a full stock, more than they can sell; it is possible that I could sell them for money I would take pay out of the store, not otherwise.\nI was pretty lucky in selling the butter at 14 even I think; they were selling good butter out of the stores at 12 and 13, but one morn Almer Taylor who appeased to be a connoisseur, bring a little for his own family, took it home to use, but did not want the large box. 2 pounds was enough.  Perhaps I can sell some of the seed, as may as he want to sow, off to Mr. Walker, he has got all his seeds & garden to buy.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101725,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101725","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:34:48+00:00","modified":"2020-08-27T03:43:30+00:00","filename":"36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg","authentication":"b15255d7b4a327beb37a75aec862e71c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_156_001_003_o2.jpg","size":1495564,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2887,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047966106043695},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034012"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034012"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034012"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"36c318df11e7fd8c02a7da8ebe2875dd.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947663,"FileSize":1495564,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2887\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2887,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:48:19","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:40:12","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:40:12","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3107,"ExifImageLength":3874,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"There is a class beginning French this term, or going to, I wish I could study with them, but I don't hardly know whether I should have time.

I never heard Isaac declaim really in my life till last Wednesday, and he really did much better than I expected.  I laugh at him some for pursuing a College course so far before he has concluded whether to go or not.  If he is not going he had better do something else.  We may not write again before you come home & about getting anything if there is any way to get them - you know what we need I suppose.

Joseph.\n[top of page upside down] The people here are very extravigant in their expressions about Ann as a good teacher, - all with one cannot want her to keep the school this summer, but if I was here I should not- she can get better schools for higher wages.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101738,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101738","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/780ec6b4d67d8f2470b9e85e3421afd1.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/780ec6b4d67d8f2470b9e85e3421afd1.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/780ec6b4d67d8f2470b9e85e3421afd1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/780ec6b4d67d8f2470b9e85e3421afd1.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:35:06+00:00","modified":"2020-08-27T04:57:29+00:00","filename":"780ec6b4d67d8f2470b9e85e3421afd1.jpg","authentication":"684a1ac229ca2225353ab9dbdb336320","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_157_001_003_o2.jpg","size":1575736,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2923,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049914978269409},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034204"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034204"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034204"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"780ec6b4d67d8f2470b9e85e3421afd1.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947664,"FileSize":1575736,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2923\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2923,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:48:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:42:04","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:42:04","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3174,"ExifImageLength":3908,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Foxcroft March 10th 184?\n\nDear Mother\nWe are all very pleasantly situated here, pleasant rooms. etc. etc.  Can step out of the back door into the Academy yard.\nI am on about the same foundation as last autumn;

What time did he arrive?  (How does Josephs coat suit.)  You know he can send it back. I hope Eliab did not get it injured in the rain.  The fact is, I know nothing what he wanted.\nHe did not even tell me how much he wished to give for one, which would have been a guide you know? The one I bought was precisely of the new fashion; perhaps you will not like it.  I had only the night to pick it out in, but I guess it is a pretty coat and cheap.  It was a perfect fit for me.  Mr. Norcross jun. of the Washington House had the mate to it, just alike for $12,00 I got it, 25 cheaper for the button lost.\nI went to Mr. Pomroys to tea Sunday.  AM gave me $5,00.  I heard Mr. Gough, (from Goff) Sab. Eve.  The best temperance lecturer, he has had great effect in Bangor. The young men need his influence.  It rained much Sab eve, & the wind blew all day hard.  So the steamboat passage was very rough & I was a good deal seasick:  I omitted to lay in provisions Sat, and had to get breakfast on board or I should have perished almost.

Hatch with whom he roomed his\nfirst year, and who was much despised & befooled here.  His capacity was small ignorance extensive, and self conceit all extending, besides being bad tempered;\nof course he was no favorite with students, you may imagine.\nI think very possible that his injudicious course may have had a bad influence from Brown, who was not very fond of his control.\nI guess Ed. behaves pretty decently now, though he attends the Tontine Ball & that a long & needless digression - I was going to say that I guess Eliab has got a very good situation indeed.  Whether it is best for him or not is another thing.  It a good family.\nI don't know much about Mrs Brown is an excellent woman, and Frank with whom he will have most to do is certainly a very smart business fellow, & well liked.\nWhat his influence otherwise may be I know not.  I am some afraid for Eliab.  He's placed under circumstances of more temptation than before, and he needs to set a double watch upon himself.\nI don't know as we ought to distrust his ability to meet temptation.  He certainly ought be well fortified with good principles, though his natural stability of character may be less than Josephs or mine at his age.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101758,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101758","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/982c78c91bf4c88e766e65ab79116e6b.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/982c78c91bf4c88e766e65ab79116e6b.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/982c78c91bf4c88e766e65ab79116e6b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/982c78c91bf4c88e766e65ab79116e6b.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:35:36+00:00","modified":"2020-09-01T02:18:20+00:00","filename":"982c78c91bf4c88e766e65ab79116e6b.jpg","authentication":"c9ab6b18e77a47c455b5d9bbe60782fb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_002_003_o2.jpg","size":1682546,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3015,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051672071740065},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034524"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034524"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034524"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"982c78c91bf4c88e766e65ab79116e6b.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947665,"FileSize":1682546,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3015\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3015,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:49:38","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:45:24","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:45:24","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"SubSecTimeOriginal":3,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3270,"ExifImageLength":3904,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I believe I wrote you something of the state of religion here.

The Chapel itself in the middle between them, is 90 or 100 long, 30 to 40 wide, and nearly 90 high, magnificently lighted only from great gothic windows of stained glass over the Libraries.  It is expected to cost some thousand dollars, & will be two or three years building.

This will be a splendid building also, wood; but planned by the same architect. We go to meeting now in an old vestry downtown. I have got $3,71 by sawing wood.

some letter comparison, no matter what.  Like the countenance of a friend, perhaps better yet, like a letter from home.\nThe letters were well filled with a variety of news and interesting matter, and I am very much obliged to you all therefore, and hope you will all\ncontinue to do as well in writing.  I was intending to write about a couple of letters in answer to yours, but as I happened to have some of this sort \nof paper I bethought me of writing a letter on a sheet of it, partly for the sport of it, and party for a spite upon Uncle Sam, whom I should like\nto cheat out of $500,00 if I could only do it honorably, out of the Post Office Department, before July.\nBy the way I intended to have carried up some paper like this to Milo, when I was there on purpose for you to write letters to me upon.\nI am getting on here just after the old sort about;  Have got my studies pretty much made up, except the Greek at least.  My Chum is the 'same old coon.' steady, industrious, studious, except poor fellow, the past  week he has got to reading Novels and really seems to have no kind of \ncommand over himself.  It is indeed a most terrible temptation to a person who has the taste already formed within him.\nTo be so surrounded with  them in every tempting form, every library, all kinds, & all authors really requires considerable self command not to be drawn into them and do nothing else but read novels from one weeks end to another.  Chum will have a fit, get drunk, he calls it, and read novels day & night almost, hardly getting his lessons at all for two or three days, or a week, and then for the reaction read no more such, but confine himself to the digest metaphysics or something for a long time.\nYou have said a good deal to me about not having any command over myself in such things, but I believe the fact is just the contrary, and\nthat there are very few who have the power to govern themselves as well in this respect as I can, especially whose natural disposition \ninclines them so strongly in that direction.\nTo be sure if I begin a story of any kind, I always like to finish it, but then I can have a dozen such things in the room by the  week and never\nlook at them.  I can read just as little such things as I please, and I do not approve of such light reading especially when one is studying.\nI am quite select in my reading, though I have not read much at all yet this term, but intend to more sometime.\nI intend to read a good deal, & to read much better than I ever have, more thoroughly.\nBy the way I mean sometimes, perhaps this year to read Walter Scotts works, the Waverly Novels so called.  Their rank & importance in the\nliterary world is such that no one is educated without them.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101764,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101764","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:35:44+00:00","modified":"2020-09-01T02:19:32+00:00","filename":"46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg","authentication":"91d049d9c4208fbd1b9147eb02fb7044","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_003_002_o2.jpg","size":2026668,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3192,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058788986354776},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034650"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034650"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034650"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"46a1871c3971058e115f318e679c8760.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947665,"FileSize":2026668,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3192\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3192,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"23mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:49:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:46:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:46:50","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3744,"ExifImageLength":4222,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I have sent in a formal request to the Government of the college to have my term Bill remitted;  I don't know whether they have acted upon it\nor not yet.  I have about made up my mind on one thing though, that is that I shall never pay it.\n$26,25 they charged me in all for last year: $24,00 for the tuition, never received, and three times the usual charge, extra, for the commencement dinner, which is charged in every students term bill. $,50 cts, being $1,50 per year or $6,00 in all for  commencement dinner, and then one is never allowed to partake of it, or even look at it until after the graduates, and has done wanting it; though from that time henceforth & forever, or as long as he lives it is to the age of Methusalah, he is entitled to a seat every year at the public dinner on commencement day!!!\nThey also charged me for every term last year the usual charge for old text.  Cleaveland's Chemical Lectures which by the way no one is ever\nallowed to attend until their junior year.\nHowever I console myself with the reflection that I shall never pay it at any rate, I can leave college, if they say so, without any very serious violence to my feelings; I mean they shall be no more willing to lose me than I shall be to go.\nI have not given them my bond, as the law directs; and most certainly never shall until this business of the term bill is satisfactorily adjusted.\nI have paid $20,00 on my term bill and have got about $6,00 now left by me.  I shall get about $7,00, I expect for taking care of the fire in one of\nthe recitation rooms this term, and probably $3,00 or 4,00 for sawing wood in the college yard.  On the other hand  I must find have some kind of a light coat, a pair of shoes, 'my boots are about gone', and something to wear on my head.\nThe rest of my past term bill besides what I won't pay is about $3,00, the next will be $15, or 18,00 and my board bill  which must be paid\nat beginning of the next term about $12,00, probably.  In addition I shall be obliged to have some new books before long, catalogues,\/ postage, mending. I want some more furniture much, a desk or some such thing.\n\n   The Societies have held their anniversaries; the Athenaean on the 19th March Oration by Moses Morrill Butler, subject 'Faith' was super excellent, the best thing I have heard I don't know when, if ever, about an hour long!  But no one got tired, or would if longer.  The writer is called by the faculty about  the best orator who was ever here, which, you know is saying considerable, for some of the best writers in the country have graduated here.\n\nThe poem was by Charles Phelps Roberts, of Bangor.  It was very good, but would not compare with the Oration.  I don't think that\nRoberts has improved as much as he ought since he was at Bangor, he has been too much a rowdy.  I should not wonder if I had  improved\nthe most since then, considering that I could not write at all then, and he was a good writer.\nThe Peucinian Anniversary was on the 2d of April.  Oration by William Lowing Avery of Belfast, Modern History as affected by  Intellect & Force.\nIt was pretty good, but not to be compared to Butlers.  The Peucinian Pact, George Henry Kingsbury was sick, they waited two or three\nweeks and then had to procure a substitute.  As there was no other senior in the society who 'knew to cultivate the muse! they got \nRev.

After the oration you see, they 9 or 9 o'clock, they adjourn to Commons Hall, where a collation is served up in style, and the evening finished which toasts, speeches.  The Feast of Reason & the flow of soul!\n\n  I was regularly initiated as a member of the Theological Society of Bowd. Coll.\n\nMarch 26th  This society is of little importance compared with the others, though it owns a small library, and meets nominally once a fortnight for discussions & reading dissertations on moral subjects Sc. and it contains many good members.  It's object is the promotion & search for\ntruth.  It's charges are $1.00 initiation fee, and, 20 per term tax, besides fines. The Initiation fee of the Penc. & Ath. is $3,00 and tax $,50 I believe, besides a Subscription.\n\n   The medical class this spring is called a very good one, members 70 or 80, Joseph Walker, Asa's brother is here, I see him once in a while. He and three other young doctors plain country fellows, all from Wilton I believe, room together all in one room only, with two beds in it and a chair apiece,\n\ndown town,  I have been in to see them once or twice, they seem to be good clever sort of fellows & will make useful men.\nThis Joseph Walker is not so much of an to look at as either Asa or James.  Looks like them both though.\n\nI have been into one of the Medical Lectures once only, it was by Dr Peaslie a fine, pale, intellectual looking, rather young man, and was upon the moral duties of Physicians especially towards one another.  The way he talked about Doctors quarrelling want any complement to the profession!  It was a very good lecture. I never have been into the dissecting rooms, I have smelt them enough though, many of other folks go in, Chum went in tother day, did not get over it all day.  They have a good many subjects this spring, bought from Baltimore, mostly colored.\n     The Church, where we students attend meeting is to be taken down and a new one built this spring.  Last Sabbath, Mr Adams gave notice that\n\nnext night would be the last time they should worship in that house, and the students demonstrated their approbation by really almost clapping, or stamping in the church some of them.  Some pretend to say that it was the greatest expression of approbation that Mr Adams ever received\nfrom the students, and to be sure, they were not quite so much to blame, when we consider the miserable accommodations they have there in the \nold church.  100 or 150 of them crowded together in that little miserable gallery, on such hard seats.\nApr. 6th Today Mr Adams preached his farewell sermon to the old House.  It was somewhat historical.  It appears that this church is a \ncentury and a quarter old, the first meeting house was built in 1720.  In 1728 the first regular minister was settled Robert Dunlop, a Scotchman, educated at Edinburgh and ancestor of the Gov Dunlop's etc. of Brunswick.  The Bible that he used in the pulpit was shown, also one of sermons.  The present house was built in 1806, and the first use of it was for the first College Commencement, before it was finished. It was then considered a very spacious as well as very beautiful house , about as it now is.  It has been preached in more than 2000 sabbaths, and a thousand young men have received their degrees in it and gone forth to the world.  Mr Adams was settled in 1829. It must be a very large church.  Me, it, said these more, and had, been for years, more than double the No. of families in the society that there were pews in the house!  And many could not go to meeting for lack of seat. I do not wonder they wanted a new house, and finally concluded to build one.  They will probably have a splendid one.  It is to be on the same\nspot with the old one, and meanwhile, two or three months we shall have to attend meeting in the vestry, a great old farm like building downtown.\nThe matter, the manner, or the writing, of this letter are certainly nothing to boast of, but I think the size ought to recommend it in your eyes,\nit surely would in mind if I could receive such from home occasionally. The next thing to it however would be such an one as Lucy wrote to me last, that was indeed a well filled letter, for which I am very much obliged to her, and take the opportunity to beg that she will repeat the favor and that frequently.  Also Joseph and all the rest of you. I wish that Eliab would realize the importance of writing to him, the benefit it would be to him.\nI think Mother that you ought to take time and write good long letters to him.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101766,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101766","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/3f555fc22c7df9f6ccba921202cefd82.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/3f555fc22c7df9f6ccba921202cefd82.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/3f555fc22c7df9f6ccba921202cefd82.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3f555fc22c7df9f6ccba921202cefd82.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:35:47+00:00","modified":"2020-09-01T02:19:59+00:00","filename":"3f555fc22c7df9f6ccba921202cefd82.jpg","authentication":"4e5156c8aad277d24912934982543cf4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_003_004_o2.jpg","size":1913015,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3194,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.055457425960713},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034717"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034717"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034717"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3f555fc22c7df9f6ccba921202cefd82.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947666,"FileSize":1913015,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3194\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3194,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"22mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:49:56","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:47:17","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:47:17","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3582,"ExifImageLength":4037,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Isaac March 30\n\n         1845\n\nBowd\n[postmark]BRUNSWICK ME APR 7                                             12ct\n\n                                                            Mrs. Anna M.

It is called by most of the class very hard, that is in the way we are required to study it. It is called Anglylytically. There are no questions and no questions asked. The first one who is called upon, and no one knows who will come first, must get up and commence the lesson, and tell it off, not word for word, but the ideas all of them, without any question or prompting, till he is told to stop, and an other called upon to take it up and go with it in the same manner. This is really harder to many, or was at first, then to commit the whole of it to memory. It is Newman's Rhetorik and the lesson is 6 to10 pages taken up so, and the review so tis 12-20 pages, this gone over every morning.\n\n  It comes dreadful hard to many, most of the class. My next neighbor, Joseph Mason, a smart fellow too and fine Scholar, he has been teaching one of the principal public schools in Hallowell for two years and a half summer & winter. & has acquired a fine reputation there. While he has been there he has about fitted for College and studied the four terms in advance! out of College at the same time teaching that school. As I was saying, this great Mason, and he is really quite a fellow, studies on that Rhetoric some 5 hours hard per day average and then can not hardly make it pass right.  I study it rarely two hours, oftener an hour or even half, and always 'sail' or have as yet.\n In connection with the Rhetoric, we have begun the writing of themes. We have commenced by forming as a separate exercise regular plans or skeletons of themes on appointed. This is really a harder business to make a regular connected plan or system then to write a theme itself.\n Many of the Class I suppose have never so much as written a theme so that I stand a better chance among them, by the way Tutor complimented my plan last week.\n Our Forenoon recitation is Trigonometry now Prof. Smyths. I like it. It is different from the little in the surveying, goes right into it. first shows how the tables are formed. It takes some time, now, as I work the problems all out & keep manuscripts.\n French is easy. Recitation is the longest part of it. I wish I had some good Mathematical instruments.\n\n[bottom of page] Mr. Adams read the Book of Haggar today. I commend it to your consideration, Ye people of Milo. Part of it is exceedingly applicable to you, and considerable of it to some.\n[right of upside down part] I dont know whether I shall ever get much interested in studies as I feel in things and\n[middle right center beside upside down part] This is probably a mistake ? that I was designed rather a laborer than a scholar. I shall be homesick or farmsick this summer I expect. It amuses me to see how different I am from others in this respect.\n[middle left center beside upside down part] I am much obliged to Lucy for the opportunity of perusing her Temperance poem.

I can go to Boston merely and come right back without seeing anybody very cheap.  Walk to Bath, and from there the steamboat fare is only $1,00 to Boston.  It is almost indispensably necessary that I should have some clothes, which, if I only had some money, I could get enough cheaper there to pay the expense.\n I must have some kind of a coat.

Has Charles sold any hay?  Who is his hired man?  What is the matter of his ? tear in page does he do his spring work?  I should think the spring  has been so far very favorable .  It has been very dry by here.  Perfect weather is coming now though. I was never intended for a 'literary' character.  It is almost astonishing how much more interest I naturally take in every thing else, especially in farm affairs.  I believe my mind is good enough that I might succeed well among scholars, if I loved study enough to apply myself sufficiently.  I do lack that  unyielding energy of soul which some have to pin themselves down & task the mind.  My mind is more inclined to be indolent than my body.  For this last fortnight of the term, especially in reviewing, it has been a 'dreadful bore' to me to apply my mind.  Even a consciousness of the importance to me of the coming examination could not compel it.  I expect I shall be obliged to 'rank' with those who trust to 'science'  and 'wits', rather than to application & diligent preparation for examination.

Brunswick May 29th 1845\nDon't be frightened at the formidable appearance of this letter, though I confess\nthat it might be a fit subject of apprehension if you consider yourselves destined to read all that I most\nmaliciously propose to 'inflict' upon you in this letter.  I almost tremble at myself, whether\nat your sufferings in reading it though, or at mine in writing it.  Could be different  to decide.\nI have just returned from Boston, got back here yesterday, Wednesday May 27.  I had a\nvery comfortable time of it:  was gone six days, and propose to myself as employment for this rainy\nday to inflict upon you a full record of all my adventures in this excursion.\nTo begin a little back.  Wednesday May 21st, as you know, was our term examination, (that\nmorning I received a paper from you, and the next day sent one in return)  I passed\nthe Examination pretty comfortably.  In the Mathematics, trigonometry, very well and in\nLatin & French pretty well considering how idle I had been on the review.  I received\nmy term bill, it was $11,01 and sent four letters to Eliab by Edwin Lee Brown.\nWith much hesitation I finally concluded to go to 'Bosting' and on Thursday May 22nd\nI started and walked down to Bath, 9 miles before noon.\nMoney $15,00 and a few coppers.  It was the sum of my possessions, drawn together by\nevery method of finance, and the reliance for meeting the bills to be brought against me when\nI came back.  Some $35,00 to $60,00 dollars.  Few would go to Boston expecting to spend\nless than that there in a vacation.  I brought back more that I carried!!!!!\nI had neither Valise nor travelling bag and so many were going away to be gone only a few\ndays that I could not well get one.  So I rolled up a shirt and a few collars and put\ninto Pewtons Trunk and started.  I arrived at Bath about noon and I spent the \nafternoon in loafing about, and examining the place which I had never before seen.\nI should have called upon Susan Carpenter, now Mrs. Sewall, who lives there, if I had\nknown where she lived.  Abby Carpenter is also there now teaching school I believe\nas P.G. Clark told me.\nBath is a place of some business, considerable ship building\nbut it has an old fashioned look about it.  It has I suppose many rich men, and an\nabundance of good old fashioned fine residences, and good looking folks, but somehow\nit has something of a 'Sleepy Hollow' look about it, that is compared with some\nof our nowadays mushroom cities, and \"parvenu's\" cockneys, with their truly Yankee and\nanti true republican reverence for outside show and the semblance of apparent \nsplendor and comfort while they would not even recognise the genuine if by any strange\nchance they should happen to see it.\nMy dinner and Supper and Breakfast cost me $,10!  Steamboat started at 6P.M.\nSteamboat fare is $1,00 there are two boat running on the line in opposition, both start every\nwhere at the same time, both are very fast boats so called, and there is quite a disposition to see\nwhich is the fastest, as well as which will get the most passengers to carry.\nWe got into Boston about 4 o'clock, A.M. an hour earlier than the usual time.\nI walked the streets, or read the newspaper in a reading room till about 9 oclock\nand then found my way to Union St. No 64, inquired of a certain freckled faced fellow\nif Mr. Humphrey Steven's' was there.  Then presented my card and claimed cousinship.\nThe fellow appeared glad enough to see me, and of course insisted upon my\nstopping with him while I remained in town.  He did not appear to have much more to\nsay than I had, which was as you may imagine rather inconvenient matter of conversation\nthat is to me with my negative capacities for talking upon 'nothing at all,'  as some practice.\nHowever I staid there to Dinner, and Slept? with him while I was there and took some 7 or 8 meals\nthere while I was in Boston.\nFriday & Saturday I loafed about and looked at\nthe 'Lions' such as I could find.  I visited the Statehouse,  enrolled my respectable  name in its\nregister and paid $.08 for being gulled with a 'guide book.'  I went over to Charleston\nand visited the Monument and Navy Yard.  The monument is certainly the best\nthing I ever saw, such simple, majestic, classic beauty, as it towers above the cities\nwhich lie before it.  I saw Monadnock Mountain from the top.  Everyone who goes\nup pays, 12 1\/2 to help finishing off the ground , paid as well as, 6 1\/4 for a book of Views.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101772,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101772","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:35:55+00:00","modified":"2020-08-29T03:58:10+00:00","filename":"e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg","authentication":"19438908ea96287797bf1bd9477fb108","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1345802,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2140,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05822957770855},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034930"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034930"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034930"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e9e0aaa21d26fb1c5e99d84acf52d780.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947666,"FileSize":1345802,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2140\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2140,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:50:10","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:49:30","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:49:30","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2989,"ExifImageLength":5028,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Saturday night I went with Humphrey to call upon Mrs. Child he introduced me Sabbath forenoon I went to the Central Church Winter Street, Rev. Mr. Rogers church. It was about the first church I was ever in I believe. The Choir of singers was nearly 100. A Mr. Angell I believe his name was of Buffalo, New York, preached, about as smart a Sermon as I ever heard.  In the Afternoon I went to hear Mr. Kirk in his new ? church on Beacon Hill. He is called you know the greatest pulpit Orator in North America. Perhaps the celebrated  Mr. Kirk (not knowing that I was to hear him, you see! did not put his Mighty Powers to the utmost: but I certainly thought the Buffalo man preached the greatest sermon. Both Mr. Kirk's & Mr. Roger's churches are new and both finished off in the same way. The Pews are all arcs of Circles, clear round, having the Pulpit in the centre. There are two broad aisles, and the side aisles are next to the  wall all around; no wall pews: These Churches seat 1200 people each. By the way Mr. Benjamin W. Bush belongs to the Central Church. I saw him in the street Saturday, om Sabbath I sat in his pew, and his little Ben took me by the hand and pulled me home to dinner with him. They had all manner of enquiries to make about Folks, especially about Millerism in relation to James  & Almeda  etc.etc.\n\n Mr. Bush who seems to be a very sensible man in all subjects, seemed to fear they had been led into excuses & extravagances as others were. And told me something of their doings in Boston.\n    In the evening I went with Humprey to the Tremont Temple and heard Dr. Beecher of Cincinnati address young men upon the importance of the Sabbath.  What a place that Tremont Temple is. I do not know how many thousands of people it can accommodate some 4000, 5000, I should think though.  The speaker has his hearers above and below and around him. before, behind, and on all sides. That night every seat was crowded and the aisles & passages filled up besides. I got a pretty good seat at first but gave it up to some ladies, there were very many standing, and crowded myself up the aisle, for I think a great deal of having a good chance to see a speaker's eyes, as well as to not and understand his hands. On this occasion I cared twice as much for this as I did for a Seat.  However they began to bring Settees from the Vestries into the aisles, and I got a good seat on one, close to the speaker. What little iron faced, rough looking fellows those great Western men are the Beechers and Prof. Stowe. Old Dr. Beecher has a splendid way of 'laying it down' though. I mean to take his oratory sometime to knock over our stiff 'Tutor Boody', that we declaim before with. Neither he, nor Mr. Kirk, nor the other great folks, were afraid to raise their left hands occasionally, or even to move their boots on the floor sometimes. Humphrey goes to Mr. Huntingdon's Church with Mrs. Child. He goes there and goes to Meeting with her always, I guess.\n\nHumphrey's folks, Mr. Albee's go to Dr. Beecher's jun. Church in Salem Street. Mr. Albee has a small store of most every thing, country trade. His wife, rather a pretty sort of a woman. Humphrey said is his cousin. I know nothing who she is, but she seemed to know about every body, and inquired  for you folks. Who is She? Her name is Martha. She has two children. I though from what Mrs. Child Said that she though Humphrey and Albee were in partnership. I understood him that he has $30.00 per Month.\n\n Sat. I attended the Exhibition of the Boston Latin School. Consisted of 20 related declamations and then Assignment of Peices. They were all boys. The first prize was given to a little fellow H.H. Coolidge hardly bigger than little James Searles! We must have better teachers of Rhetoric and Oratory here before Bowdoin Students can appear as well, in the matter of ease and grace that is, as those Boston boys did. \n\nThere were 5 Prizes for declamation and 15 for Translations, versions and theme. besides which a dozen were called out on the whole and publicly honored for exemplary conduct and industry.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101773,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101773","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b76f9bd310b05fb956aa7884790612da.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b76f9bd310b05fb956aa7884790612da.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b76f9bd310b05fb956aa7884790612da.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b76f9bd310b05fb956aa7884790612da.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:35:57+00:00","modified":"2020-08-30T04:12:34+00:00","filename":"b76f9bd310b05fb956aa7884790612da.jpg","authentication":"da961bd8cc7d6e809f88bfb30d8df0b8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_005_003_o2.jpg","size":1314550,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2218,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.054877183314965},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034947"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034947"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["034947"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b76f9bd310b05fb956aa7884790612da.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947666,"FileSize":1314550,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2218\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2218,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:50:12","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:49:47","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:49:47","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3049,"ExifImageLength":4947,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"One Fellow, Lorenzo S. Cragin jr. took the sec. prize for Declamation, the best Latin recitation from Shakespear and the best English Theme, as well as being one of the twelve Exemplars.\nMonday 26th I walked out to Harvard in the Morning and loafed round the Colleges a spell. ad then went to Mount Auburn, admired it beauties & wandered amidst it peaceful groves till one oclock, then went over to Fresh Pond and wandered there till 2 1\/2 oclock then took the cars to Charleston. There is a little Railroad fare you know to carry ice from Fresh Pond to Charleston. There are many beautiful monuments at Mount Auburn and some splendid sculptures. I was there nearly 4 hours and saw about every monument but I could have stayed 4 times as long with Pleasure. Fresh Pond is a beautiful [lace, it is a fine sheet of water, bending round round a peninsula covered with tall trees without underbrush. On it is a Public house all in the Woods, which is a favorite resort of some folks. Around the house are ninepin alleys, fine swings among the trees etc. etc. In the pond smooth pretty beach to walk upon. Fish are plenty. little boys were wading along the beach killing Alewifes with clubs and stones. Some of them had dozens. The ice works & ice houses are really worth seeing. At the Rail Road Depot are some 5 or 6 brick buildings 80 or 100 feet long 40 wide & 30 or 40 high, packed solid with ice, which many men were loading in cars. It is a cool place in there on a warm day. I told you I wrote to Charleston and called upon Miss Jersuha Holmes who is about to go into the Female Seminary. She & Mary Tower are in Charleston but I did not know that.\n\n     I did not get into Boston until too late to attend Bible Soc. Meeting, which was ?page torn in the afternoon. In the Evening I went to the Amer. Peace Soc. Meeting at Central Church Judge Jay of New York delivered the Address, which was of course good.\n\nTuesday 27th. I went to the Convention of Classical Teachers at Tremont Temple. There were not a great many there and they did not seem to do much, but  I had a chance to learn the faces of some of the ?page torn men of the Profession.\n11 or 12 I went up to see Mrs. Childs. She has particularly requested me to call again. Mrs. Child did talk - how well she can talk! Never? there was a chance her daughter put in a word edge wise; And I certainly have the merit, as, I forget who it is, says, of being of a good listener. At least ?page torn really talks well. It is a very great gift to be able to talk. I dont know how many things they wanted me to tell you. One was they expected that Aunt Dolly was dead. I dont know who she is, but they said you would. I believe they said she was Uncle Humphrey's wife or widow. At any rate they told how she was an awful infidel and did not believe anything and drank wicked rum besides, and made her Sons vagabond drunkards? And when her son Bill reformed, and improved so much that folks did not know him and ?page torn that he was a man. Then she took pains to set her tumbler of rum & sugar in his way so that he might smell it and drink again, for she said it always did do the boys good and she wished he would drink some. They lived in Orange and the boy Bill was most 40 years old.\n\n Elizabeth was much obliged for Lucy's peice of poetry, thought it very good, and had put it in her Scrap Book which she had been making with much pains, and showed it to me. Among the Autographs of the distinguished visitors, many which I noticed ?page torn written by Hannah Richard Child. Who is She? The Authoress Miss S. G. Edgerton, Lucy knows her poetry, is about to be married to Cousin Dwight Mayo. Who is he? They sent an abundance of love etc. etc. to you folks. Were going to write but preferred to send by me. Elizabeth acknowledged the receipt of Ann's letter should have written but was not able. She was in Bangor all winter last till March.  Was sick most of the time. did not expect to live. Sent for Mr. Hedge to see her etc. etc.\n I stayed there for Dinner, Mrs. Child showed me her Garden etc. etc. When I started to come away, Mrs. C. came out in the Entry and gave me a little folded peice of paper, she was going to send by letter she said, and was glad she had this chance. The paper contained two ten dollar bills! I guess I did know nothing what to say. I guess I did mumble terribly. think Mrs. C. wanted her money should do some good while she lived. Encourage interest etc. etc.\n  I knew nothing how to express my thanks and dont yet. You cant help think how necessary as well as unexpected such a money was to me. With the greatest possible prudence, I should have only $1,50 when I get home to pay my bills with. I had bought a Coat for $3,00 when I ought to have paid $1,00 for one and 2 pr of pants to wear all summer for $,75 each! I had concluded to go without any Cap or hat, or vest, or anything else I needed.\n And when I had some money, I restrained myself and bought nothing better so I brought back the $20,00. entire. My whole expenses over six days were Steamboat $2,00, Clothes etc. $4,70. Union? fees $,40, food etc. about $,50. which paid for 9 meals and all drinks fruit and other good things that I had beside. I really wanted to go into the Museum and should if I had staid another day. And to go over to East Boston and see the steam Ships too.\n However I had a very good time,  enjoyed in it finely, Saw many things I wanted too, and really did me a great deal of good, and cost hardly $3,00 which I probably saved in buying only $4,00 worth of clothes.  And then get $20 besides\u00a0!!!!!","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101774,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101774","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/89e76c363a66ff80bc8002e13c17eebd.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/89e76c363a66ff80bc8002e13c17eebd.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/89e76c363a66ff80bc8002e13c17eebd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/89e76c363a66ff80bc8002e13c17eebd.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:35:58+00:00","modified":"2020-09-01T02:21:58+00:00","filename":"89e76c363a66ff80bc8002e13c17eebd.jpg","authentication":"b3506832ff49db5eea29c111382613a8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_005_004_o2.jpg","size":1419664,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2237,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058761900031457},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035001"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035001"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035001"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"89e76c363a66ff80bc8002e13c17eebd.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947666,"FileSize":1419664,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2237\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2237,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:50:14","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:50:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:50:01","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3093,"ExifImageLength":4976,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I am almost frightened at the extent of this letter. You must get along with and excuse mistakes as well as you can, for I will not dare to attempt reading it over I think.\n\n  I should have been glad to have staid longer in Boston, but I had no place to stop except with Humphrey. And I thought it only fair to quarter myself upon him so much; it must be inconvenient. Mrs. Albee too with her little children & 3 men folks was trying to get along without a girl. I most wish I had stayed through till Friday. Many of the Meetings through the week would be very interesting, and some other things I wanted to see . Probably too if I had wanted to Friday the Steamboat fare would have been but $.25 perhaps. but they said that the other boat Penobscot carried  1\/2 or 1\/4 or anything to get passengers.  I preferred to go in the John Marshall & dont regret it. This boat was built & put in the line by the Kennebec folks, on purpose to put the fare down reasonable, because the Proprietors of the Penobscot were unreasonable. I think the new lines, Peoples line, they call it, ought to be sustained. They are both very fast boats & there is competition for a day speed as well as passengers.  Both boats out at the same time and close together. When I went up we were but 10 hours, & coming back I suppose it amounted to Racing. Both boats probably went as fast as their engines could make them.   They started out of the harbot  about 1\/4 mile apart, and till near 10 you could hardly see that the distance between them increased a length. In the morning  Penobscot was 2 or  3 miles behind, though her Capt. had sworn \"big oaths\" the day before that he would pass. The trip to Both was made by J. Marshall in 8 hours 53 minutes!  I went to Brunswick, got there 8 or 9, came back, hungry and sleepy, for the boat was not a very good place to sleep, in her hurrying, so, though it was perfectly calm.\n                  I have got a room at Mrs. Graves where our club is. She could not very well board me but offered every convenience for boarding myself. I took the hint, bought a loaf of bread, 4 or 5 pounds of best pilot bread, a pound of cheese. She supplies me with some lapses? and a quart of milk per day, and I have every prospect of living as independent as you please for a week, till I can get into College again. no studies or Bell to ? make afraid, nothing to do but read, write, sleep etc. & grow fat.\n\n[right-hand side] I brought home $27,60 so I shall not want that $5,00 that I begged for so hard in my last letters, you know. I am hoping this will get there before you have many any effort to send it to me. I suppose $11,00 or $18,00 will pay my bill at the beginning of term, except the regular Term bill which can wait at 6 per cent interest. This week I guess will not cost me more than $1,50 if it does that, and I shall have $8,00 or $10,00 to pay the initiation fees to the Societies, buy my books, and so forth. I think I shall get along very comfortably through the term. Then if I can find any thing to do from Sept. to March to earn some money - then - try and find me a school or something to do.\n\n The season is about two weeks earlier in Mass. than it is here. About Boston the grass looks finely, heating? out some, Lilacs, Apple and Horse Chestnut trees, here just blossoming, blossomed there a fortnight since. At Milo I suppose it has just thawed out and people just begun their spring work. At Boston I once walked down Wheeler's court, same door that I remembered. T. Thaxter on it. On the steps played a pretty little curly-haired girl & boy. Mr. Bush has some pretty children.\n Stone place I seen a new churn. Simple six sided box, Set in a frame, with a crank to turn it, and I should think cheaper and easier better than one like yours. It is really astonishing to see how Boston has grown & is growing, and the cities which have sprung up around it, for Charleston, Cambridge, Roxbury, South & East Boston, might be called cities. It is but a few years comparatively before Boston will be the largest City in America. New York can page torn in the page torn greatness. Any decent man, young man, must be shiftless who cant make page torn now:  I guess you will be glad to see that I am going to close this letter. I hope you will write very particularly. I wish you would send letters as this, and let me know all about you and your affairs at home there, of every kind, you cannot think how much it would interest me.

June 1845\n\nDear Mother,\nI suppose you have received a letter from\nme since you wrote last, although I have since received two or three letters\nfrom Bangor, one of which was partly written by  you.\nAfter receiving those letters from Bangor at the beginning of the term,\nI wrote one and directed to Joseph about a week ago, June 15th.\nI concluded then that I would mail no more letters until\nafter July 11th.  Perhaps I shall not send no more letters until\nJuly 11th.  Perhaps I shall not send this till then.  It will \ndo me harm to have some letters written before hand ready to send.\nBy the way, as postage will then be less than half as much, it\nwill be well to write about twice as many letters; I hope you will bear\nthis suggestion in mind, all of you at home, and write to me.\nI am getting along pretty comfortably this term, for so far.\nThe principal excitement has been about our College Societies.\nI am an Athenaean.  My Chum & I you remember, arrived here one \nday to late to join last term.  I suppose I was rather prejudiced in favor\nof the Athenean when I came here; at least Mr Task was on Athenaen and \nmost of my old acquaintances.  But the best part of our Class are Peucinians,\nI got perhaps the most acquainted with Peucinians  & liked them best.\nIn some respects the Peucinian has the advantage; It is the oldest society,\nand its graduate members are probably more influential although\nperhaps hardly so public spirited.  I was extremely puzzled to decide.\nMy Chum was also Athenaean when he came here and came from Waterville, but he\nby immense fishing was finally coaxed off & joined Peucinian, though he did not\ndecide till the very day.  We made a find excitement I assure you; two such\nmembers are not found every day, even here, and you can hardly conceive the \ninterest felt and the efforts made to get us into either society.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101776,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101776","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d982c574abe4027c0e9fe4ad05219b67.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d982c574abe4027c0e9fe4ad05219b67.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d982c574abe4027c0e9fe4ad05219b67.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d982c574abe4027c0e9fe4ad05219b67.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:36:01+00:00","modified":"2020-09-01T02:23:14+00:00","filename":"d982c574abe4027c0e9fe4ad05219b67.jpg","authentication":"3d68a3205bf1e354139e6052ded55140","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_006_002_o2.jpg","size":1703442,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3003,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.052522847522848},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035105"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035105"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035105"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d982c574abe4027c0e9fe4ad05219b67.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947666,"FileSize":1703442,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3003\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3003,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:50:19","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:51:05","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:51:05","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3190,"ExifImageLength":3824,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I hardly know as I was noisy in joining as I did, & very possibly if my chum had\nbeen Ath.

I can pay as alone attention to anything, or learn anything thing as\nquick as most any one can, but I lack the energy of will to confine myself\ndown to any thing for hour after hour, or day after day.  There is a constitutional\ndifference between Joseph & me.  Eliab is still different.  I think he has a\nmuch more natural talent than either Joseph or I, but I do not think that all\nthe training in the world could ever make him half so great a man\nas Joseph might have been, with suitable advantages of education.\nMy next door classmate will sit down and bore right into a lesson steady for \nthree, four, or five hours right off without flinching or weariness of mind.  If I do the same\nfor one hour, I do well like most every else.  But very likely I should get the lesson\nin me hour that he would in three.  Still this iron energy of will, this indefatigable\nproperty of mind, with physical constitution to support it, is invaluable.\nIt is the stuff to make great men of.  The rational capacity of mind has\nvery little to do with ultimate success.  The mind, my mind, is sufficiently capable\nof cultivation and improvement, indefinitely capable; for success it requires only\nthe power of application and perseverance of mind, supported by a sufficient physical\nconstitution.  I don't think I am naturally deficient in any of these things, and\nI believe that with an equal chance and without disadvantages I might have been\nable to take a rank in any class, but entering here as I did , with my whole\nprefatory studies four years old, and two thirds forgot, and the studies of the freshman year\nhalf learned in 4 or 5 months, I could not expect to be a very thorough\nscholar, or to take rank, even if I tried to, over those with so many a advantage\nover me.  Still I believe my standing in my class, which is a very good one,\nis respectable.  I am certainly among the best Mathematicians in the class\nand not very decidedly inferior in any thing.  Not to say though that I should\nnot be if others were what they might be.  There are very few college students who\nmake much improvement of their advantage here as they might, in fact it is not to\nbe expected that they would where they can get along so easily with so little study as\nby can have if they chose.  It is not very often that the really talented fellows, and\nthere are many such here, take the rank, or the heist stand in college.  It is the\ninferior minds usually, but patient, persevering, frequently unpopular with their mates\nsometimes one in a thousand, impelled by a principle of duty, usually ambition.\nI can't say that I should not like right well to take a junior part.\nor an oration when I graduate, if I ever do, or be President or Orator of a college\nsociety next year, but still I hardly think that my ambition will ever have\na great effect upon my efforts, or influence my exertions in any great degree\nI can in that it does others.\nI suppose it ought to merit.\nI hope you will write oftener, tell me what is going on, you do not know how\nmuch good it does me to hear from home.  Tell me what to do, what shall I \ndo this fall.  I suppose I must stay out if I can get a school anywhere.  You don't\nknow how much I hate to though or how much good it would do me to stay, in many\nrespects.  if I had, or could get 100 dolls nothing would keep me out, only these two years\nnow that I have to stay.

I arrived here Friday night, and shall commence my school tomorrow, Monday Morning.\nI suppose you will want to hear the whole story, as usual. In the first place, then; Our Yearly Examination, was on Wed. Aug. 27th at which time I was almost sick, having a very bad cold, and having been out a good deal the two nights before, being the Prize Declamations at the Junior & Sophomore Exhibitions. It was a very cold rainy day, We were obliged to sit in the Old Chemical Lecture room, hardest seats in the world most, for 8 or 9 hours two hours and more at a time without moving. I felt bad enough, I assure you: It was a much harder Examination than usual besides. However I got along through the Latin and Greek and French, very well indeed, much better than I expected in comparison with this, and considering the peculiar 'state of my feelings' at the time.  But in the Mathematics - O Tempora! O Mores! or any thing else! How I did get screwed! I had expected to show to advantage in Mathematics, if nothing else. I believe I am considered one of the best Mathematicians in the Class, I have certainly studied the Mathematics of the year as thoroughly and understandingly as any one of the class.  But at that time the violence of my head ache totally incapacitated me for thinking. Old Smyth (probably relying upon my ability) gave me a kind of theoretical demonstration from the Spring term studies; I had not thought of it recently, At an other time I could have thought it out, but there, I could form no idea of it; and was obliged to get something else assigned to me  which I performed.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101789,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101789","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b9105db4c65579be03b4a32c3ef80fea.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b9105db4c65579be03b4a32c3ef80fea.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b9105db4c65579be03b4a32c3ef80fea.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b9105db4c65579be03b4a32c3ef80fea.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:36:20+00:00","modified":"2020-08-30T19:30:32+00:00","filename":"b9105db4c65579be03b4a32c3ef80fea.jpg","authentication":"0e17d8a4556adb78da153f27ab9445b7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_009_002_o2.jpg","size":1690308,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2862,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.054685534591195},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035310"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035310"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035310"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b9105db4c65579be03b4a32c3ef80fea.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947667,"FileSize":1690308,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2862\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2862,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:50:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:53:10","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:53:10","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2975,"ExifImageLength":3741,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I do'nt care much about it, though it provoked me some at the time to see others, who know almost nothing at all of the years studies, pass off smoothly, while I stopped.

However, Examination only marks on the Rank Books as much as four weeks recitations! and as I am absent so much, I can not expect to take a very high rank.

Rode back in the Evening Hours, It was day of the Freshman Examination, Class Supper, then their Annual Bonfire & 7 bbls Tar. So I was up all night, laid down a little at 5 A.M.   I guess I felt sore all over for a few days. I had a good deal of business to attend to for the Succeeding week I was there, for the Societies and boarding Club.\nCommencement was hardly as good as usual. It was held in the new church unfinished, loose floor, stagings &c. all 'in status quo' It is an awful great house, then so noisy you could hardly hear much. Tuesday 2d, Peucinian Anniversary.

A Little Portland fellow, Charles Goddard, commonly called 'Cud Goddard, brother of the celebrated or notorious 'John Goddard', of down east, who was elected Phi Beta Kappa last year, was there, and from some personal enmity, growing out of the Secret Society matters, persisted in black balling M.M Butler about the best fellow in the class, had much the best part at Commencement Many ballottings, Goddard was obstinate, and the Old ones being unable to get Butler, threw up & put by the election till next year. So there is no PBK in class. Goddard has immortalized his name, but rather honored butler, as it shows how determined they were to have him. I expect they will write to Goddard's Marm to tie him to the Bed post another year.\nI did not know how I was to get to Turner, as there is no Stage conveyance except through Portland or Augusta, take 2 days, cost 3 or 4 But 'Old Parson Greely' (perhaps you have heard of him), very famous man in this part of the world, Minister at Turner most 40 years, till dismissed last year, was as usual at Commencement, going west, his son 'Life or Eliphalet, going home with the old hoss all alone, carried (or brought) me home most joyfully, right to 'Parson Greely's', Friday night, did 'nt know hardly as I should ever get away, Parson Greely gone, Old Lady, I suppose long dead.

Mr.    Cal. Baptist, young, called a very smart man, pretty large Society I guess\nThen the 'Old Parish', Congregational, Minister a Mr Eddy, youngish man from Conn. Successor to Parson Greely.  Society now rather weak. The folks here are mostly Universalists, in fact, it is one of their Strongholds But, by good Providence, I am thrown a little among Congregationalists. Talbot, the Agent is one. I board at Old Deacon Dresser's, a fine place I am thinking. Family, Old Deacon, his Son, & Son's wife fine woman, two little children. Moreover, 5 or 6 scholars from other parts of the town are coming here to board.  Turner has some advantages.  Good soil Sands set apart by the Proprietors, School fund $200,00 per annum employed to sustain two such schools as mine, every fall, different parts of the town. Ministerial fund $350, per annum. Enough to support one minister. Always has till lately belonged to the Old Parish, source of much town contention, lately by legislative enaction, every voter decides to whom his part shall go.  So the Congregational Minister gets only about $40,00 of it.  rather a small share.\nI did not know any but Catholics opposed the Bible in Schools. Universalists here, are said to Bates, Minister says he wants no one to teach his children to read in the Bible but himself, and I suppose he rules things here. Do you suppose the man will rule me? ha! he! I guess not! He lives next house to the school house. I board about 1\/2 mile from School house\nI got me a coat made at Brunswick, whole cost $13,00. It is a $4,00 broadcloth, Black. Just in fashion, sets neatly, perfect love of a coat! Most a pity to carry that and my splendid cloak way off up to Turner. Turner though I hear is celebrated for its 'Women', its pretty gals! My school will be most all of that sort. I expect they are terribly 'unsophisticated' though.  I also gave $3,00 for a hat, got a neat one too, & $3,12 1\/2 for a pair of pants. Boots I must have before long. I got a watch of Carey & Co. Brunswick, gave my note for $19,00 in three months, interest thereafter.  It is a Lepine, small prettiest I ever saw almost, prettier than a Lever, Ladies watch, give it to Lucy sometime.

Most all the grain, I guess they do not raise a great deal, was harvest when I came here 3 weeks since, all cut, some few stooks standing out. People cutting corn then & yet, digging potatoes.\nMy health is good. Perhaps I eat too many apples for one who has not been accustomed to much fruit lately; Still I am well, though they say I do not fat up any yet, as I was intending to. You know I always have grown poor teaching. But this school, great as it is, besides being High, is not hard. I believe I never taught a school which fatigued me so little as this. It really is not much if any harder than good hard day's work. The government is exactly nothing.

About 60 scholars now. 70 at first, some had to leave for lack of room.  I hear about 20 classes per diem, ought to have nearly 1\/2 hour each. I crowd them into 7 hours. I have about as good classes in most branches as was usual at Foxcroft Academy. Mathematics better, 2 classes in Latin. Virgil & Reader. 3 classes in French, 12 scholars, 2 of them have read more French than I have though my Education, in that is complete! Burritts Astronomy 12. Philosophy most 20, Chemistry, History, Geometry, Geography &c. Also Upham & Abercrombie. Large classes receiving Smiths' & ?, Welch's Arithmetic. Colburn's, Baileys & Smyths Algebra, Smyths', about 12, first rate, many of them been about through it before.  In fact I believe the school would average more forward & better school than Foxcroft Academy, the Scholars here have had better advantages than most who attend there.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101796,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101796","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/5d3594b5ddeb3bb82324ced056430703.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/5d3594b5ddeb3bb82324ced056430703.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/5d3594b5ddeb3bb82324ced056430703.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5d3594b5ddeb3bb82324ced056430703.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:36:30+00:00","modified":"2020-08-31T01:51:55+00:00","filename":"5d3594b5ddeb3bb82324ced056430703.jpg","authentication":"6730816d395bc5257c2958f24c8d1d19","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_011_003_o2.jpg","size":1952347,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2897,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.062400024290773},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035358"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035358"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035358"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5d3594b5ddeb3bb82324ced056430703.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947667,"FileSize":1952347,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2897\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2897,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:51:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:53:58","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:53:58","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3041,"ExifImageLength":3778,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I suppose I have been extremely fortunate here, was at first, people took a notion to like me, I dont know why. It is a little strange too. You see people here are most all Universalists, far the largest and most influential part of the town, though I happen to be placed among what few Congregationalists there are. Agent is a Congregationalist & I board at the Deacon's.\n\nThere has been great opposition made even to reading the Bible, it has not been practiced in any of the town or high schools for some years. I was in a real quandary, knew not what to do. Folks here, where I board & other religious people say that they should have advised me, for my own interest & success, before hand, before witnessing the success of the experiment; to have let it all go.\n However the first day I only organized the school, did nothing. The Sec. day, partly I suppose from ignorance, partly, perhaps from my natural stupidity & obstinacy, first prefacing some remarks I went on and opened the school by reading a chapter in the Bible and a short prayer merely asking a blessing, and so continue. I expect it astonished folks some.\nHowever, the success was beyond every ones most sanguine expectations. It took people a little by surprise. no one thought of such a thing in any body I suppose. However the Scholars Mostly a great heap of girls, had all taken a notion to like me beforehand, partly perhaps because I looked so much like Seavey, the last Master who was extremely popular here. At any rate no one found any fault, every one liked the master better & better. Of Course, that very thing made one part of the people my strong friends & supporters for the first thing, and, it  seems, has gained me no ill will from any one. The Great Universalist Minister Mr. Bates, People at Milo have heard of him, he has been all over the State, is one of their very big guns, lives next house to the school house.  His two daughters go to school, and most splendid scholars, in Latin, French, Abercrombie, Mathematics etc., much interested in Studies  apparently. Mr. Bates has shown considerable interest in the school. Much please at my introducing Burritt's Astronomy, & getting a large class in it. He appears to be a great, big, sound headed, good natural sort of a man, with a big tongue.\nMr. Eddy, the Congregational Minister here, I am not inclined to like very well. He is a small, prissy, sharp, sort of a man, meddling in every little thing & very set in his way, just about and opposite to Mr. Parker, I might guess, not very likely to conciliate, I reckon. I do not consider him talented, though he was thought by the people here when they got him here, year ago. I believe they would have done better to have settled that little Mr. Southworth, perhaps you remember preached at Sebec & Foxcroft year or two ago, and who preached here a month or two on trial.  I like the idea of settling a young minister, in such a place, both to have the benefit of his improvement in preaching, and also give him a chance to, as he matures, adapt himself to his people & situation instead of, having himself & character already formed, being obliged to fit a people & place to himself which is not always quite so easy. Today He preached very energetically for him, on the perseverance of saints. I did not like it. I believe I am a Calvinist, but if the doctrine must be expressed in that way,  I do not wonder that it is a hard saying for many.\n                      He exchanged last Sabbath with Mr. Butler, the Cal. Bap. Minister. He is a little boy apparently, has preached two years & I believe is not yet 20! He is really very talented I say. He intend to leave off preaching and get an Education soon, if he does he will make a smart man & powerful preacher some day I believe. He ought to he has talents which it is his duty to cultivate, and I do not think Wesley's the best way always.\n I rather think I shall engage a Winter school, about here, somewhere, can very well I suppose. not probably get but $18.00 per month though. Wages here are low. 16 is as high as is often paid in the largest schools. These High schools turn out lots of Teachers you see, which reduce wages all round, with the 1\/2 doz Academics not far off.\nI guess I can get $100,00 by Spring term, if Providence prospers, & perhaps if they want me, I'd better come back here next fall. So, if I have my health & prosperity I can get through College, in some sort, honorably or not is another thing. I wish I could have been in College this fall, & money enough, & a little more head to back up besides.  I suppose that I have certain friends in College who are determined that I shall be Pres. of Ath. next year. It might probably be some advantage to me, & perhaps a fit object of Ambition, if I were Ambitious","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101797,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101797","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/42be09d72e8b44801fd58452593df528.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/42be09d72e8b44801fd58452593df528.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/42be09d72e8b44801fd58452593df528.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/42be09d72e8b44801fd58452593df528.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:36:31+00:00","modified":"2020-08-31T02:08:29+00:00","filename":"42be09d72e8b44801fd58452593df528.jpg","authentication":"6bee4e289b3dd3b80c656c66fc7cb338","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_158_011_004_o2.jpg","size":1386738,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2920,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.043973173515982},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035404"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035404"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["035404"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"42be09d72e8b44801fd58452593df528.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947667,"FileSize":1386738,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2920\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2920,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:51:10","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 03:54:04","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 03:54:04","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3011,"ExifImageLength":3712,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"??

You can hardly imagine the good it does one to receive letters from home, when one is so far off, in a strange land, though perhaps I hardly ought to say among strangers; for I have got acquainted here considerable, more than I am apt to. I have certainly succeeded very well here, so far; at least I have, I think likely, about the greatest High School, ever taught here in Turner, and certainly none ever got along more smoothly. It would amaze a common teacher to see my school, I reckon The school house contains two rooms, and the school being so very large we have taken a couple of planks out of the partition & the scholars sit in either room part, indiscriminately. Besides every one has full liberty to do as they please & go as they please. No one asks leave to pass from one seat or one room to another, or out doors, or or any where or any thing else.

It is a small school, very forward, always paid higher wages than the large schools about; and then lengthen it out by private subscription. School money would never make more than 6 or 8 weeks, but they never have less than three months.  The only ill of it is they wish it to commence for a whole fortnight after this closes, which is too bad.

Dec. 4th, 1845\nDear Mother\nIt is Thanksgiving day, and I feel really disposed to write a letter to Milo - to Mother. though I believe I have written at least once since, receiving any letter from there, besides one or two to Bangor. What a stormy day it is! How natural it is, at any time, for one's thoughts to wander away, from the present & the here, to - to Milo, and especially so this particular time of Thanksgiving day. Oh! if I could only set down by the old stove, and have a good old fashioned talk, with you, and Lucy, and Brother Charles; who, I suppose, compose your family at Milo now. I suppose I have enough to be thankful for now, but it seems that would add some to my happiness, if it did not to my gratitude.\nYou don't know how much I have thought about home, and the People there, within a few days, since my school closed here.  I suppose, too, you are thinking occasionally of the absent ones, and especially so today. However, I suppose you are all getting along comfortably at Milo, as usual, in about the same old sort of way; and, as for myself, you know, of course, that I am comfortable, as I always am, wherever I may be. And, at the present time, I am certainly surrounded by every thing, except home, to make a person comfortable and happy. although I have nothing to do hardly.\n[Written up the left side and across the top sideways]\nNow I really think you ought to write me some good letters in return for this and and the last one I sent I believe I do rather more than my share of writing letters for the family. There are as many as seven of you down East at Milo and Bangor, who ought to write. While I am here all alone. Yet I guess I write letters full as often and as much as any one writes to me. Which is, you see, sevenfold as much on the average. though to be sure, some of you seven re not very good letter writers, that is, if my experience is a fair example. Charles never writes I believe.

Every time I begin to think of it, I begin to think almost that it was rather silly business for me to attempt to go through College, for I really do not know what to do with myself, when I do get through, if I am permitted to.  If I had not tried to get an Education, I could probably have found something to occupy myself about while permitted to dwell here, and it would not have of a great deal of importance what it was, or how; but after one has, bu any means, acquired a liberal, it might be said, a public Education, there seems to be a greater responsibility resting upon one.  There is more expected of one, to be sure, those expectations are so  frequently for certain cause disappointed that they are less than it would seem they might in some cases reasonably be; there is in reality a greater responsibility, the enjoyment of advantages & priveleges that others have not, and the cultivation of mind, and the power, moral & intellectual power that should be the result, of course seem to demand a corresponding influence, a greater debt of duty to one's fellow beings, something more like a king the world better & happier for one's efforts What a preamble! and now I dont know what I intended to say\n\n I can seem to see my way after a fashion, through doubts and difficulties, to be sure, through College, or nearly so; That is, with all most favorable circumstances, looking only on the bright side of things} if Providence spare my life, and continues my health, and blesses me with success in every thing, and every effort, as, I ought to be thankful, has been the case with me so far, so much.

A year whenever, or two hence, when she is done with it, could it be sold for half or for any thing?

Why could not that Sister Lucy who 'really wanted to write' have thought of that?

One can but be busy, and in either case is not obliged to be but so many hours. But the Wages are fixed, it is not Tuition, but a Trustee'd fund supports the school, just so much per year.\n\n It is hardly fair to tell the $20,00 per month though.

I shall earn this term by building fires etc. etc. some $15. or 20.00, which will keep the term bill along somewhat. Somehow I expect to have some money the first of June to pay for Board bills & incidentals, say $25.00.\nIf Charles can help me to it - good, if not perhaps I can borrow it of Joseph as I did last summer. If I have my health, & the blessing of Providence, and  do not get too deep into Society Expenses, I shall be better as well off next spring as this.\nPerhaps, under all most favorable aspects,  and uniform good fortune & health, might get through College by only borrowing $100,00 to pay my Graduating Expenses!\n\n I have been extremely economical: can't tell for the future. May yet spend $50.00 for term for societies.  I cannot be mean.  I think I have done pretty well in dress. $60, or $70,00 is allowed per annum to dress a young man.  I have spent $60,00 in 18 months.

You cannot think how interesting such thing are to me, how I have wanted to hear about all such things for a whole year past, and could hardly get a word from any of you. How I should like to see all the things! for instance those colts. It seems Charles now likes the red one the best, I always did, but he always used to have a curious prejudice for the little grey, just as he used to for the little steer, perhaps because he was so chunked. How much does he prize the Donkey at? We will never sell him for $100.00 I suspect.\n\n As for my poverty it is vexatious enough I assure you, but I have made up my mind not to suffer myself to be much disturbed by it. I can get along somehow, as others do. I can without running in debt as others, some others do: I will be: and am economical about useless things. I will not spend $100, per term in riding about, or $20,00 in Cigars, or in going to balls, shows & parties, or more get in drunken sprees.\nBut as for the Societies, I am in for it, and I will not back out. I never have been naturally disposed to be very active in such meetings. Every one knows I am not ambitious, not enough so for my own interest in College, or any where else, or for my friends.

A.B. C. F. M. It has been remarked that great mean are not always wise. It is still more true that worldly wisdom sometimes carries great men out of the path of simple straight forward truth & right. They become too nice to see that it is the best policy. Expediency is a great God. At meeting of the A.B.C.F.M. last Fall, the Great Men, Dr. Woods of Andover, Dea Beecher, Stowe & Anderson etc. big guns, were set to make a report on the great Slavery question, much agitating the country, & threatening to divide the Board.  It was a great duty. They felt it. The interests of the country & the world were on them. They were Great men, mighty men; but their souls were not big enough They feared the face of man, trusted not in God, and bowed down to the God Expediency.  They made a report. It was a master peice. It spake of Organic & inorganic sins; a cunning theory. To the Northern Man it was an Antislavery document: to the Southern Man it sanctioned Slavery in toto. It was designed to unite all parties, the plan apparently succeeded. The board were, it was said unanimous. The lesser lights dared not shine. But - the craven northerners dodged.  They probably feared Expediency also. At any rate, out of some hundreds of Northern & Eastern men present, only a dozen or two signed the report. Moreover most of those who signed the report were immediately elected Corporate members of the Am Board, none of the others!\n\n But the matter could not rest there, some thing cannot be covered up even by Leonard Woods D.D.  et cum suo.   \n  Woods & Co doubtless thought their wisdom would be for \"the greatest good of the greatest number.\" it was the very difficulty. They should have thought what is morally right, conform wisdom to that, not that to wisdom: and let Him whose right it is take care of the consequences. \n                                         Do write to your Son I.S.

But there are strong fellows to fight it.\n\n  The whole torrent this spring has been to 'put down' \u0394\u039a\u0395, to run it by any means no matter how, private & public, individual & general; open & concealed, malice & scorn, lies & sneers. - but all originated in fear. But all will not do: truth must prevail.  The yearly Class Election of Orator & Poet in the Sophomore Class took place last Friday. \n\nThe candidates for Orator were the \u03a8\u03a5 Stevens, the big gun of the Class, the great man of \u03a8\u03a5 and my good friend & Brother Case of Levant.  It was hard contested and great excitement. One would think the very existence of \u03a8\u03a5 depended upon Stevens election. Even the Seniors interested themselves in it, electioneered for them. On our side, the Sophomores worked it out for themselves, in all ?houses? Case was Elected. 18 to 17 One majority.  It was justly considered a victory, little to be sure, but a beginning. It is secretly called an omen that Metcalf will be next President of the Athenaean Society! \n\n  The defeat did not set very well upon the \u03a8\u03a5. They made a terrible outcry, in their anger brought a raving charge of Lying etc. against a \u0394\u039a\u0395. He defended himself calmly, and with so much true courage that they could not get him to fight, and finally they were obliged to take back and apologize! It was rich.

I did not want him to, but I suppose it was a good thing. You see he is to lazy to harness the horse often, and it really suffers for exercise. I really pitied the poor thing, it is very large indeed, heaviest horse in Bath, and Mountain of flesh, so far it could hardly get along.\n\n  Arrived at College at 10 P.M. Thursday, June 11th, some what tired but well as Metcalfe, having had a very pleasant, and cheap journey.  Clark arrived perhaps twenty four hours sooner, having come all the way through in the stage, probably cost him considerable more than me, and had much harder time if it every way.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101832,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101832","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/1903272fe7b762de8a9ab5b5d7c78715.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/1903272fe7b762de8a9ab5b5d7c78715.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/1903272fe7b762de8a9ab5b5d7c78715.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1903272fe7b762de8a9ab5b5d7c78715.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:37:20+00:00","modified":"2020-09-01T20:52:24+00:00","filename":"1903272fe7b762de8a9ab5b5d7c78715.jpg","authentication":"f5f68c9a9ccb05bafd6b4e4bf054edee","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_159_005_003_o2.jpg","size":1878006,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2864,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.06071558814401},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["232824"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["232824"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["232824"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1903272fe7b762de8a9ab5b5d7c78715.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947669,"FileSize":1878006,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2864\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2864,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 11:56:04","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:28:24","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:28:24","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3183,"ExifImageLength":4000,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Things are getting on here much as usual, considerable excitement about the elections, and increasing.

After some trouble mooring out 'bonny bark', and getting ashore.  we set people to work, and did ample justice to the best fare the place afforded, before midnight . High time. \n\nNext day. Bathed, Fished, Sailed, Rolled Ten Pins etc. etc. till after dinner. Found Money enough in the company to pay Eaton of the Mansion House, (which by the way is a splendid place, well kept) some $12,00 or $15,00.  After Noon breeze sprang up, and we had a splendid sail back, got home by 6, or 7  oclock P.M.\n  Take it all around we had a splendid time and none the less so far being unexpected. We did not know what kind of a scrape we should have with the College for running away, expected admonition perhaps at least. But went before they had time to call us up, and told them our story, and Kellogg, Minister of Harpswell, a great friend of Students, was up, and spoke a word for us, and they let it all pass.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101836,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101836","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/97c6fb5e7ca50159e6a64e49e35bc3c8.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/97c6fb5e7ca50159e6a64e49e35bc3c8.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/97c6fb5e7ca50159e6a64e49e35bc3c8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/97c6fb5e7ca50159e6a64e49e35bc3c8.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:37:26+00:00","modified":"2020-09-01T21:24:50+00:00","filename":"97c6fb5e7ca50159e6a64e49e35bc3c8.jpg","authentication":"4d7847442659fb7a99e38efadbb64378","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_159_006_004_o2.jpg","size":1635844,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2819,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053730768725448},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["232850"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["232850"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180725"],"TimeCreated":["232850"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"97c6fb5e7ca50159e6a64e49e35bc3c8.jpg","FileDateTime":1587947669,"FileSize":1635844,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2819\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2819,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:26 11:56:19","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:25 23:28:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:25 23:28:50","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":66,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3112,"ExifImageLength":3973,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1274,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1274","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"There was some alarm and conjecture, in College, as to what had become of us, you may imagine.

No matter for the injuries or complaint of those not big enough to make any noise.  choke them off.\n  You say you cannot write much. Why not? If you have not pen & ink, you ought to have, and time enough too to write to your children.\n\nDo write to me often. Make Eliab write me a long letter before he goes back to Bangor; it will do him good. He is the negligent. He has not written to me- I hardly know when.                                          I wish you all know how much I want to know how every thing gets along there at home. How I should like to help Charles cut that hay.   I'll stop and put this in P.O.

Aug. 9th 1846\n\nDear Mother\n\n                   I should think you might all conclude that I do not mean to be considered a neglectful correspondent, however careless and worthless my letters may be. I believe I have written at least a dozen full letters to 'the family,' within eight weeks past. Enough surely, without they were better! In answer the them, I have received in all five!  hardly the usual proportion.  This too in term when I have had so very much of every thing to attend to, of my own business and studies and every bodie's else. I have not even had time to write my regular College themes. until three or four days past, when taking advantage of a little respite and two or three 'adjourns,' I have elaborated about a dozen solid pages of Theme.\n However I owe an apology for writing letters home so carelessly as I do. When one writes a letter home, in a hurry, the mind wearied by study and thoughtful writing, he is most apt, of not more careful than I usually am, to merely scrible of what comes up first, a mass of words, without much thought or sense.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101841,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101841","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/f8b54cfbe8ced0c582888a0171aeb933.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/f8b54cfbe8ced0c582888a0171aeb933.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/f8b54cfbe8ced0c582888a0171aeb933.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f8b54cfbe8ced0c582888a0171aeb933.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-27T00:37:32+00:00","modified":"2020-09-02T00:21:52+00:00","filename":"f8b54cfbe8ced0c582888a0171aeb933.jpg","authentication":"be72b4a8e421dd5b63f6d018494c22fc","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_159_008_002_o2.jpg","size":1957960,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

What could it mean! The hand writing, be sure, looked a little like some of our folks, but not exactly, coming from Greenbush! Where is it? up Penobscot\u00a0? Money extremely convenient as I was all out at Commencement too. \nIf you can decipher, or cannot, this mess of scribbled nonsense, I hope you will write immediately.\nI am very anxious to hear from home,  how every thing is getting on. Charles and all his work and so forth.  Lucy I suppose has got home by this time. Joseph wrote he was going home in Sept.

Took it to Mrs. Elizabeth Mizelle to type and notarize. She did the Old Age paper and Cora & Clarence witnessed it, and Mr Mizelle promised to mail it for me to Mrs. Williamson. Then we got our groceries - Cora had lots of errands and in doing them she lost a report that Mildred had left with her to see 3 different Woodmen's Circle women to check with, so she went back to the drugstore to hunt it up and Clarence brought me home - groceries $4.67. Am keeping track to see how near I come to living within my income.\nYesterday morning I heard a story during the Coffee Hour and an ad. for Ever-ready batteries, of a man whose life was saved from the attack of a grizzly bear at Yellowstone Pk. The m.c. asked for stories from others as to the merits of the Ever-ready batteries. So I bethought me of the time they saved me from being sprinkled by a skunk, and at 3 a.m. - I got up and wrote out the story and mailed it to W.DBO. Orlando when I went to the p.o. I asked them to let me know if they rec. the story. As I hadn't heard the first part of the program I don't know whether or not they offer to pay for the stories. hope they do,l and that I get some sponduliks [slang for cash] for it.\nAlso, at Mrs. Mizelles I left a blank for warranty deed for you which Elizabeth will type, etc., for me.) cooked some beet greens and had some rice I cooked this a.m. and a piece of cherry pie I bot at A.& P. They do make delicious cherry pies and for only 38 cents. Also made myself a cup of instant coffee from your jar of Maxwell House, with plenty of sugar and Carnation milk to keep myself awake in case the ladder is delivered this aft - And I'm so sleepy now I can hardly see!! It probably will keep me awake all night as that happened the time before that I tried it. Weather so mild I've had no fire of any sort today. Cora said that Larrie will not be able to go to school for 4 or 5 months, and her dog Judy is in the hospital to be put to sleep.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118464,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118464","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4fc792a657ae77bb3d954c081b042188.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4fc792a657ae77bb3d954c081b042188.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4fc792a657ae77bb3d954c081b042188.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4fc792a657ae77bb3d954c081b042188.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:33:57+00:00","modified":"2021-10-11T14:47:46+00:00","filename":"4fc792a657ae77bb3d954c081b042188.jpg","authentication":"df2b0f15e78bfc7cd5704d0c9ab2dfeb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_138_002_001_o2.jpg","size":1209314,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2491,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044951231842038745500911289809664594940841197967529296875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["233007-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["233007-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["233007-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4fc792a657ae77bb3d954c081b042188.jpg","FileDateTime":1612460031,"FileSize":1209314,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2491\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2491,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:33:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01111111111111111153515462746099728974513709545135498046875,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 23:30:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 23:30:07","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.49185299999999987363707987242378294467926025390625,"ApertureValue":4.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3058,"ExifImageLength":4418,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1383,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1383","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Friday 9 a.m. Jan 20, '56\nDarling Tafern,\nHave just rec'd this letter and while I'm waiting for Cora and Clarence to come, I'll begin my letter to you.

Sometimes I feel like climbing and picking them myself -- but the hospital looms up, so I don't try.\nMaybe that fruit is the tangelo, now. Tangelos are abt as big as grape fruit, lemon color, few seeds and sweet. tangerines are small, thin skin so you can pull it off easily and divisions are easily eaten without a lot of juice, and they are deeper color than oranges.\nShall be very interested to know the reactions to the Three Bears after next Sunday.

I gave the ticket to Mrs. Renfro to give to anyone, and I paid Wm 20 cents for his weeding. I had to pretty nearly stand over him and point out the weeds to get the job half-decently done.

Terrible wind for several days because of the Alabama tornado, of course.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118486,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118486","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4a9662336ef04c65dafa9a2efc34fde9.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4a9662336ef04c65dafa9a2efc34fde9.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4a9662336ef04c65dafa9a2efc34fde9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4a9662336ef04c65dafa9a2efc34fde9.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:34:23+00:00","modified":"2021-06-22T19:31:57+00:00","filename":"4a9662336ef04c65dafa9a2efc34fde9.jpg","authentication":"8627e14f623c01a186b562cd877c7fd0","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_138_010_006_o2.jpg","size":1559719,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3198,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0451589824658930327760941736414679326117038726806640625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["233334-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["233334-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["233334-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4a9662336ef04c65dafa9a2efc34fde9.jpg","FileDateTime":1612460032,"FileSize":1559719,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3198\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3198,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:34:04","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01111111111111111153515462746099728974513709545135498046875,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 23:33:34","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 23:33:34","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.49185299999999987363707987242378294467926025390625,"ApertureValue":4.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2771,"ExifImageLength":3119,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1383,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1383","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"6)\nDottie was making buttons of the same cloth as of trimming for Mrs. Riffle's dress.

Said he might have trouble getting parts, but would return the player as soon a possible.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118501,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118501","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/83d62b9c9b98ef57cf88a6eb303e1d5f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/83d62b9c9b98ef57cf88a6eb303e1d5f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/83d62b9c9b98ef57cf88a6eb303e1d5f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/83d62b9c9b98ef57cf88a6eb303e1d5f.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:34:41+00:00","modified":"2021-06-22T19:31:57+00:00","filename":"83d62b9c9b98ef57cf88a6eb303e1d5f.jpg","authentication":"614b069f914068d2b4217e1539c832bc","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_138_013_003_o2.jpg","size":1237065,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2305,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049693299590262716980415547141092247329652309417724609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["233754-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["233754-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["233754-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"83d62b9c9b98ef57cf88a6eb303e1d5f.jpg","FileDateTime":1612460032,"FileSize":1237065,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2305\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2305,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"9mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:34:38","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01111111111111111153515462746099728974513709545135498046875,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 23:37:54","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 23:37:54","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.49185299999999987363707987242378294467926025390625,"ApertureValue":4.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"SubSecTimeOriginal":36,"SubSecTimeDigitized":36,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2332,"ExifImageLength":3642,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1383,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1383","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"3\n\n    And I want to thank you all over again for the fine record.

It is absorbing, not only for the perusal but for the research.  I've had 2 atlas's by me all the time and have consulted the ency dictionary constantly to get out of it something  of what she put into it.  In spite of the mishaps, misinformation and rudeness of officials, etc - she encountered, she stuck doggedly to her determination to see Africa.  I get a good idea of the continent now, where before my ideas were hazy.  She went clear to Cape-town and up and down the Coasts away, then saw the Victoria Falls on her way up.  At the equator - which she doesn't mention - it was only 90\u00b0 but from there, Nairobi, to Cairo and back to Luxor - the land of the pyramids, mummies, etc - she found filth, squalor and beggars.  Then she had a bad accident at Cairo and it was wheel-chair and help from her guides after that.  Tho she didn't give up the trip to Portugal, after suffering at Istanbul and Rome.  She liked Portugal best of all.  It was so clean after Egypt and Turkey that she'd like to go back for a vacation there.\nAlong the side of the page  Thanks for Laura's card.

It will probably take 2 1\/2 to 3 hrs to cook it. Turn your gas low and keep it just at the boiling point until done. Let me know which you like best yearlings or springs and hereafter I will be governed accordingly. \n\n  Max gave me your letter to read. I think it will be very nice for you to go to Florida. I note what you say about working here. We have not wanted you here to work harder than you now are.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118567,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118567","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/27f6d8b3851ddf946ce4590dd6473553.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/27f6d8b3851ddf946ce4590dd6473553.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/27f6d8b3851ddf946ce4590dd6473553.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/27f6d8b3851ddf946ce4590dd6473553.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:35:59+00:00","modified":"2021-06-22T19:31:57+00:00","filename":"27f6d8b3851ddf946ce4590dd6473553.jpg","authentication":"411b017d674f58a8af76eac00adc22fa","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_144_004_004_o2.jpg","size":1699790,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.0 (Windows), datetime=2020:12:1","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2763,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05696270827468800923565339644483174197375774383544921875},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20201211"],"TimeCreated":["014140-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20201211"],"TimeCreated":["014140-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20201211"],"TimeCreated":["014140-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"27f6d8b3851ddf946ce4590dd6473553.jpg","FileDateTime":1612460035,"FileSize":1699790,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2763\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2763,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"16mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.0 (Windows)","DateTime":"2020:12:11 14:31:03","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01111111111111111153515462746099728974513709545135498046875,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:11 01:41:40","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:11 01:41:40","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.49185299999999987363707987242378294467926025390625,"ApertureValue":4.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":30,"SubSecTime":0,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"SubSecTimeDigitized":0,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":4102,"ExifImageLength":5344,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1383,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1383","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"but to reduce expenses.

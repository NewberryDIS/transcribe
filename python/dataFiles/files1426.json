McGill, professor of English and associate dean at the Rutgers College of Arts and Sciences here.\n  Professor McGill said New England history of the 1840s describes the \"radical\" younger generation as rejecting secure careers in commerce and spending time \"mooning\" in the woods, crying out against oppression of the workers, exploring the \"inner life,\" wanting to \"be\" rather than \"do\" and enclosing flowers in correspondence with each other.\n  He selected Channing, Thoreau's companion, described by some as a \"transcendental hippie,\" for a biography.\n \"It's true,\" the professor said, \"there were superficial resemblances to today's hippies.\n \"The younger generation as a whole then rejected conformity as the hippies do,\" he said noting that Thoreau and Channing \"dropped out\" of accepted patterns of living to seek ways of living life more fully, as hippies contend they are doing.\n  But Thoreau and Channing, both from Concord, Mass., were different from today's hippies in that they sought the secret of a full life in nature and believed in taking \"life as it came,\" Professor McGill said.\n  \"Thoreau said morning air was his chief intoxicant.  Thoreau neither smoked nor drank and Channing did not drink.  Both undoubtedly would have rejected artificial stimulants and the use of 'mind-expanding' drugs,\" the Professor said.\n  He declared that Channing's life was governed by whim, \"whereas Thoreau believed in giving up what he desired least in order to leave time and a little money for the essentials.\"\n  Channing desired all things but didn't want to pay the price,\" the author said.\n  Still, Professor McGill said, the two men \"gave each other moral support in the face of the condemnation by the Concord community.\"\n\n5 Jan 1968","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":123128,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/123128","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/20aa7c097b42f0ee82fdacf34fbea575.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/20aa7c097b42f0ee82fdacf34fbea575.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/20aa7c097b42f0ee82fdacf34fbea575.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/20aa7c097b42f0ee82fdacf34fbea575.jpg"},"added":"2023-01-04T22:13:52+00:00","modified":"2023-03-30T04:05:07+00:00","filename":"20aa7c097b42f0ee82fdacf34fbea575.jpg","authentication":"e1429c931afff99ab775e4409c68d534","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"992006198805867_midwest_ms_conroy_box_00007_fl_00382_000003.jpg","size":279241,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1271,"resolution_y":2000,"compression_ratio":0.0366169682664568563179585680700256489217281341552734375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00007], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230103","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00007], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230103","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00007], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230103","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1426,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1426","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1\nSunday 28 Jan 1968\nDear Jack - Thanks for your letter and good news of The Tillerys.

W. KENWORTHY \n\n  WASHINGTON -- Everett McKinley Dirksen of Illinois, the Senate Republican leader, still pulls a full house for hs Tuesday press soirees.  But it is a ho-hum audience.  There is a growing body of Republican legislators who think the weekly \"Ev and Jerry show\" carries about as much wallop as \"East Lynne.\"  And the Republican Governors, worried about the party's image, wish that Ev would content underlined in ink:   himself with, say, giving the nominating speech for Richard M. Nixon at the Miami convention next August, and not insist on being chairman of the platform committee.\n  But all this has as much effect on Mr. Dirksen as -- to borrow one of his better metaphors -- \"a snowflake on the bosom of the Potomac.\"  He is satisfied that age has not withered nor custom staled his appeal where it counts --in Illinois.  Therefore, the 72-year-old Senator announced last week that, unlike some of his septuagenarian colleagues--Hill of Alabama, Hickenlooper of Iowa and Carlson of Kansas--he had no intention of retiring and would run in November for a fourth term.  It was hardly news.\n  Mr. Dirksen's biographers are likely to record that whatever enduring fame he deserved he earned in his contribution to the passage of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  At the outset he had opposed all three.  It is true, of course, that his come-about was designed to catch the wind--underlined in ink: Mr. Dirksen has a very sensitive finger.  ink in margin:  why \"finger\"? \n   Nevertheless, he earned the accolade--never before bestowed on him--of statesman, and if he had gone on from his high point in 1965 the Republican liberals would be happy to have him continue as their leader and to preside over the writing of the platform.\n   This he did not do.  With that calculating, and sometimes miscalculating, perversity that has characterized his career, Senator Dirksen proceeded to espouse causes that were not only lost but, in the view of the party liberals, downright silly.   Such were his vain attempts to get Congress to stay all court orders on re-apportionment of state legislatures and to reverse by means of constitutional amendments the Supreme Court's one-man, one-vote ruling and its ban on public school prayers.\n   Two weeks ago Senator Dirksen and House Minority Leader Gerald Ford were forced to surrender their monopoly of the Republican reply to the President's State of the Union Message in the interest of letting the nation see what was billed as a younger, more forward-looking, more representative profile of the party in Congress.   As it tuned out, Mr. Dirksen was hospitalized with the flu and could not participate.  It really made n difference, because the procession of Republicans only demonstrated  how nearly this collective mental profile (with one or two exceptions) approximate that of Everett Dirksen.\n   The realization of this fact may explain why party chairman Ray Bliss is apparently unmoved by the request of the Republican Governors Association that Gov. Raymond P. Shafer of Pennsylvania be a co-chairman of the platform committee.\n underlined in ink:  In short, everything is going along in the Republican party just as Lyndon B. Johnson would have it.  As things are, the President has the best of both sides of his old friend Everett Dirksen.  He can point with gratitude to underlined in ink: Mr. Dirksen's support of Vietnam policy and he can point with scorn to the Republican leader's \"neanderthal\" opposition to welfare measure.\n   Therefore, if Sargent Shriver, director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, yields to the importunities of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley and decides to run against Mr. Dirksen, the feeling in Washington is that he can expect about as much support from President Johnson as Representative Sidney Yates received from President Kennedy in his 1962 challenge against Senator Dirksen.   \n\nsidebar to main article  'Honored'   The Republican doves--what few of them there are--have been dismayed at Senator Dirksen because of his almost consistent support of President Johnson on Vietnam.\n\n  Even those Republicans who are hawks think Mr. Dirksen is \"too thick with Lyndon,\" and too eager to demonstrate it (\"when he calls me, I feel honored, my party should feel honored to have him seek my advice.\")  Many Republicans were appalled when Mr. Dirksen took the floor to charge that Senator Thruston Morton of Kentucky had \"demeaned\" the Republic by [[underlined in ink: saying that President Johnson had been \"brain-washed by the military-industrial complex.\"  written in ink just below this underlining:  Here!

Dozens of articles in the press have stressed the message that the Communist party-prescribed method for all the arts pioneered by Gorky at the turn of the century is still compulsory.\n   A steady stream of people, including Soviet leaders, filed in homage past a memorial to Gorky in a central Moscow square yesterday.  By nightfall, the area was a mass of wreaths.\n   The Government newspaper Izvestia printed a photograph of the writer on its front page under the headline \"Artist, Revolutionist, Humanist.\"\n\nName Means Bitter\n\n   Gorky -- the pen name means Bitter -- was born Aleksei Maximovich Peshkov on March 28, 1868, in a middle class family fallen on hard times.\n   Soviet critics, who contend that socialist realism is the highest form of artistic expression, regard him as the central figure of world literature in the 20th century.\n   But in spite of the official adulation heaped upon him here both during the Stalin's rule and since, Gorky identified himself with the Bolsheviks only in the last years before his death in 1946.\n    His death was probably caused by tuberculosis contracted in his early years.\n    During the purge trials of the late nineteen-thirties, Soviet officials charged that Gorky had been murdered by Stalin's opponents, but this accusation was later withdrawn by former Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev.\n\nInebriated Equestrian Sentenced to 5 Days\n\n  AUBURN, N. Y., March 28 (UPI) -- Ted Wiffen was sentenced to five days in jail today for riding a horse while intoxicated.

Naskiewcz issued the sentence in  lieu of a $25 fine.\n  The police said Mr. Wifen, who lives in Cayuga, was intoxicated yesterday when they halted him on his horse near Auburn State Prison.  He had fallen off several times, they added.\n   While the horse was taken back to Cayuga, MR. Wiffen spent hte [sic] night in the local jail awaiting his court appearance.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":123142,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/123142","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8682680a4a2f23d5612d94826d8e8e87.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8682680a4a2f23d5612d94826d8e8e87.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8682680a4a2f23d5612d94826d8e8e87.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8682680a4a2f23d5612d94826d8e8e87.jpg"},"added":"2023-01-04T22:14:01+00:00","modified":"2023-04-01T03:39:26+00:00","filename":"8682680a4a2f23d5612d94826d8e8e87.jpg","authentication":"5233ba2aa2617385338aa443c61fd49e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"992006198805867_midwest_ms_conroy_box_00007_fl_00382_000019.jpg","size":498744,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2000,"resolution_y":1316,"compression_ratio":0.0631641337386018297817003031013882718980312347412109375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00007], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230103","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00007], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230103","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00007], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230103","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1426,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1426","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"postcard\nGREETINGS -

Certainly William Faulkner guessed as much when, after reading italicized:  Black Boy, he urged Wright not to stay too close to the memory of his own grief.\n\n   Readers aware of the autobiographical content of Wright's works could claim awareness of that grief, but only now has Constance Webb made its magnitude visible.  Her biography was begun, with Wright's full co-operation, in 1945.  Since his death in 1960 his heirs and associates have given her full access to cherished papers and memories.  The whole story is here.  It is more than the biography of one man, however; it emblemizes the plight of the Negro race in modern America.\n   There were the early Southern years -- a broken home, an animal-like existence as a sensitive nature was repelled by the humiliations  of second-class citizenship, the ever-present need to wear a mask of stupidity in an environment where literacy could lead to lynching  Wright fled to Chicago where, grateful for anyone's interest in him, he became a Communist.  Presently he saw, however, that there were forces and depths in his own tradition that communism did not take into account.  Christianity was not mere escapism.  Through it the black mass in America had kept its dignity.  In its images, symbols and attitudes the American Negro had found the \"highest crystallization of his will to live.\"  Although in these views he anticipated the era of Martin Luther King, his own nature was too turbulent to be won to nonviolence.  For Gandhi it might work, but it was alien to the traditions of the West.\n  Because he deplored the \"dehumanized image which Americans carried of the Negro,\" Wright was branded a dealer in extremes both by whites, who believed the lot of Negroes in America was rapidly improving, and by Negroes, shocked at the brutality of his Negro protagonists.  Yet everywhere he went in America the shame of racism haunted him.  Waitresses in white restaurants salted his coffee; officialdom fingered his books suspiciously and even the fabric of his suits; underlined in ink:  his four-year-old daughter was denied access to a ladies room in a New York department store;  he was harassed when he bought a new home, challenged even when he examined produce at a fruit stand.  He was appalled to realize that though a Negro had perfected the blood bank technique, the American Red Cross refused Negro blood.  \"There's no democracy for the black man in America,\" he decided.  \"We're all scared all the time.\"\n   He left America for France.  He traveled in Africa.  Yet those who thought that in a new milieu he would make a human gain were misled.  In Africa he saw that though the whites were gone, Negro consciousness remained what it was.  He prized the restiveness of Americans.  He love English so much he could not learn French.  He was an uneasy exile.  If Russia moved across Europe, he expected to be liquidated for his repudiation of communism.  England barred his entry.  Americans said he had lost touch because he did not think the problems of race in America were near amicable solution.  Perplexed, alone, he died in Paris at 52, his heart shattered by an anguish that he, as one of that class that he called \"the tragic elite,\" could no longer bear.

[with arrow drawn pointing to photograph in the article] ]]\nBy James T. Farrell\n\n  I MET Ernest Hemingway in Key West, in 1936.  to me, he was very genial, friendly, and hospitable.  I had been in Key West for a few days before I sent him a note.  Upon receiving it at his post box, he came to the rooming house where I was staying, immediately.\n  I had known his family in Oak Park.  Ernest expressed disappointment that I had not immediately looked him up in Key West.\n  One of the fist  things he said to me was that when he had read the fight scene in \"Young Lonigan,\" he had known that the writer had it, and knew what he was writing about.\n  One of my first remarks to Ernest was to josh him.\n  \"Hemingway,\" I said, \"I am going to write a book, titled \"Death at 3 P.M. on the Diamond.' Chapter One will be 'The Heroism of Ty Cobb's Hook Slide.'  Chapter Two will be 'The Pathos of Lefty Grove's Outcurve.'  Chapter Three will be 'The Tragic Stance of Paul Waner in the Batter's Box.'  Chapter Four will be 'The Sadness in the Eyes of Silk McLaughlin When He Calls a Man Out at Home Plate.' \"\n   Ernest burst out in hearty laughter.  My playful parodying of \"Death in the Afternoon\" amused him.\n   WE TALKED ABOUT prize fighting.  Ernest explained why Gene Tunney defeated Jack Dempsey for the heavyweight championship of the world.\n   \"Dempsey was a hooker.  Tunney was a straight puncher.\"\n   I quoted this remark to Gene Tunney.\n  \"Yes, that's true,\" Gene said.\n  Ernest believed that Gene Tunney was one of the greatest of heavyweight champions.  I think I would concur.\n  Ernest and Gene Tunney were loyal friends.  Gene Tunney is loyal to Ernest's memory.   He tells interesting anecdotes about his friendship with Ernest.\n   I also talked with Ernest about italics:  jai alai, or pelota or fronton.  I was pleased to learn that he was enthusiastic about his sport.  He knew some of the players.\n   \"Piston and Guillermo are probably the greatest italics: jai alai players in the world,\" I said.\n   Ernest knew them.  He shared my admiration for them both.\n   PISTON PLAYED up front, and Guillermo played back.  Sometimes they would be matched against three players.\n   Piston was flashy and graceful.  He could catch hard rebounds with his italics:  cesta, while playing up pretty close to the front wall.   He was skillful in placing shots, and frequently he would catch his opposition off balance.  One return he had perfected was a two wall carom shot that was virtually non-returnable.  He would catch a rebound, close up, on his right and close to the side lines.  When he used this carom shot, he let the italics: pelota go out of his italics: cesta quick but with speed and neat precision.  The italics: pelota was directed at an acute angle near to the juncture of the front and side wall.  It bounded off the front wall, to the left, hit the left wall a couple of yards or less from the juncture of the two walls.  Then, the italics: pelota rebounded off the side line, fast, and at an acute angle.  It came back fast and more or less to where Piston had started the shot.  And it hit inside of sidelines by a foot, or even inches.  It was a mean, effective shot.\n  Guillermo was a big man, but fast on his feet.  It was a task to get the italics: pelota by him so that he would fail to make a return.  He ran up the walls, and made returns.  He showed what is called \"class.\"\n  Ernest agreed, too, that Guillermo was probably the world's greatest italics: pelota player.\n\nItalics James T.

Richard Wright, who had been coming regularly to Wednesday night writers' workshop meetings at my 737 Rush Street house on the Near North Side, was not among those present that evening.  He had been absent for three weeks running.\n  It occurred to some of us that he might be ill, or lack the carfare to make the trip from the South Side.   Two of us decided to pay him a visit the following day.  Then it turned out that none of us knew where Richard was living.  We had been his friends for a year or two and none of us knew where he lived!  He must have been asked at one time or another, but it dawned on us now that he had never answered that question, had evaded it in one way or another.  We had a vague idea where it was, but nobody could remember ever having been given an address.  From his occasional references in conversation and a few allusions in stories he had read aloud in the workshop, we pieced together some notion of the neighborhood and decided to go there and somehow trace his whereabouts. \n   There was a chill intermittent rain when we set out about noon the next day in a cranky old jalopy we managed to rustle up for the trip.   After two or three hours of enquiries in neighboring grocery stores, drugstores, restaurants--no one seemed too eager to divulge such information to a carful of white men, who might be debt collectors for all they knew--we managed to pinpoint a street and find some kids who were willing to lead us to the house.\n  I left the other fellow in the car with the driver and went in alone.  There was the smell of poverty and decay in the hall.  A child answered my knock, and a woman came forward -- Richard's mother.  I told her I was here with some friends of Dick's, and was he at home?  You could see fear in her eyes.  She hesitated to answer.\n  I told her we were members of a writers' group Dick belonged to, he hadn't attended for some time, and we were worried that he might be sick.  Silently, uncertainly, she pointed to what looked like a bedroom door.  I knocked and, when there was no answer, I called out to him, telling him the purpose of our visit.  Still no answer.  Puzzled, I was preparing to leave when the door burst open and Dick was out like a shot, making for the front door and calling back after him, \"Let's go, let's go.\"\n  I hurried out after him, running a block before I caught up with him and brought him back to where the car was parked.  We were both breathless.  He got into the car, and only then was I able to explain why we had come looking for him.\n  He was plainly hostile, sullen, resentful, close to tears, but we managed to talk him into stopping at a fish house for a chat.  He accepted our explanation but was still reserved:  no, he hadn't been ill, he was out of work and didn't have the carfare, he was busy looking for a job.  All with a mixture of pride and humiliation.\n  It was clear he resented our intrusion and, having seen his home, I could understand why he had never told us his address.  He was ashamed of the squalor, the ugliness, the poverty.  It was an incident familiar to me from my own childhood, the reluctance of my Jewish schoolmates to invite gentile schoolmates home to meet their greenhorn parents in the equally squalid ghetto flat of the immigrant Jewish ghetto.\n  Then as now, poverty had the same humiliating stench, the smell that money -- greed -- landlord neglect makes.  Only the food smells distinguished a Negro ghetto from a Jewish ghetto or an Italian or Polish ghetto, and in some neighborhoods it was a pungent bouquet of some or all page cut off below this point\n\n   It was three weeks before we saw Richard again at our Wednesday night workshope. [sic]  He never alluded to the incident again and we never mentioned it, although the theme of traumatic shame suffered by the Negro in the Black ghetto in his contacts with white friends cropped up again and again in the stories he read aloud in the workshop.  It was to be a recurrent leitmotif in his life and writings for three decades, until his death in 1960.\n   He referred to it often enough, but because it was accompanied by an overcompensatory defiance (and, by turns, angry silence) it did not look like fear to any but his most intimate friends.  Even after the publication of \"Native Son,\" when his yearly income was over $30,000, he was still expounding \"his favorite thesis,\" to quote Constance Webb:  \"Fear is the most dominant emotion in  Negro life....We're scared all the time.\"\n  Horace Cayton and Elmer Carter, on that occasion, knew (says Constance Webb) \"that it was rare for Negroes to admit the simple fact, 'the fact that we are scared all the time of white people.' \"  That was when the three of them went to a famous seafood restaurant in Brooklyn and the waiter momentarily set down some dirty dishes on their table because his hands were full, Carter, with Wright's encouragement, pushed the dishes onto the floor with a crash.\n    \"Tell me how you felt, Carter,\" Richard persisted.\n    \"Just hate before I pushed them,\" Carter explained, in a low, tense whisper.\n    \"And after?\"\n    \"Pain in my legs, nausea, fear, tension, but I'm all right,\" Carter told him.\n    \"I wonder how many white people realize how common such feelings are among Negroes.  How many understand how they make us feel and live?\" Richard pondered.\n    Wright's widely-publicized break with the Communist Party is still relevant enough to merit the attention Webb gives it in the book, in view of similar confrontations today between writers and Party policies in the Soviet Union and other communist countries.  There has never been a time since Gorki, Mayakowski and Pasternak when it cased to be relevant.  When the honeymoon  between the writers, artists and the [[lines are drawn on both sides of the rest of this sentence] fraternally aligned but predominantly non-communist-member John Reed Club was over (the Party peremptorily dissolved the Club), Wright allowed himself to be seduced in the Party as an Organizer.  All it did was sharpen Richard's awareness of the meaning of Party discipline.\n  lines are drawn on both sides of this paragraph through the words\"to Party policy   I was among those fellow writers of the writers' workshop and others who urged him not to subordinate his artistic integrity to Party policy, but I think we were not surprised when he chose to ignore our warnings.\n   Eighteen years later, in \"The God That Failed,\" a collection of essays by ex-communists and ex-fellow travelers, Wright explained the special attraction which the Party and the Communist movement had for him, a Negro writer, as distinguished from white writers:\n   \"It was not the economics of Communism, nor the great power of trade unions, nor the excitement of underground politics that claimed me; my attention was caught by the similarity of the experiences of workers in other lands, by the possibility of uniting scattered but kindred peoples into a whole.  It seemed to me that, here at last, in the realm of revolutionary expression, Negro experience could find a home, a functioning value and role.  Out of the magazines I read came a passionate call for the experiences of the disinherited, and there was none of the lame lispings of the missionary in it.  It did not say: 'Be like us and we will like you, maybe.'  It said: 'If you possess enough courage to speak out what  page is cut off here\n\n  It was a belief and a hope that was destined to lead to heartbreak.  Among Negro members of the party, he was openly laughed at as an \"intellectual.\"  \"I'm not an intellectual,\" he protested. \"I sweep the streets for a living.\"  The \"living\" was thirteen dollars a week.  He was on relief and had been assigned to sweep the streets -- \"made work,\"  \"leaf-raking,\"  \"Boondoggling\" were some of the current epithets for such jobs.\n  For a talented young black man in search of education and recognition in a white world, there was little to choose between ridicule from his own people and patronizing condescension from white people--most of whom, with the exception of his fellow writers in places like the Writers' Workshop, were inheritors of the long anti-intellectual history of the U.S.\n   As for Communist functionaries, white and black alike, they were out to USE him.  I gathered from conversations with Richard at the time that he resented being used, but it was better to be used by a cause he believed in than to be insulted and ignored by a society that had no use for him at all.  News of Nazi anti-Jewish progoms [sic] was coming out of Germany, and there were signs of similar reactionary violence in the German-American Bund and renewed Ku Klux Klan activity.  He had been warned:  \"You can't resign from the Party.  People would think something was wrong with our organization  if you resigned.\"  Anyway, \"regardless of tactics, what is there to GO BACK to?\" was the question he was asking himself at the time.\n paragraph marked by lines drawn in ink beside it  Witnessing the \"trial\" of a Trotskyite and word that a campaign was being launched to rid the Party of \"Negro Trotskyite elements\" -- and being among those who were secretly trying to influence members to leave the party -- brought him closer to resignation.\n    He saw the accused Trotskyite \"confess,\" and he read about similar \"confessions\" at the Moscow trials.  Of his accused comrade, he reasoned that \"the vision of a communal world had sunk down into his soul and it would never leave him until life left him,\" and he applied the same reason to the Moscow trials.  It also accounts for his reluctance to resign from the Party.\n   Besides, when he finally left Chicago and went to New York, in 1937,  he was immediately taken in hand by Benjamin J. Davis, Jr., and assigned a desk in the Harlem Bureau of the \"Daily Worker.\"  A publication to be called \"New Challenge\" was planned, and Richard would be appointed to edit it.\n    For openers, he was to write two to five thousand words on a revolutionary history of Negro literature and its prospects for the future.  He wrote a 20 page draft, \"Blueprint for Negro Literature,\" arguing that the Negro was a victim of economic exploitation and not racial prejudice, and envisioning a Negro Republic in the South, which was not identical with the Party's slogan, \"self-determination for the Black Belt.\"   It was an all-out position of black nationalism, whereas the Party position was \"Black and white unite and fight\"--that is,  against capitalism.  \n   At the same time he was holding down a job with the Writers' Project of the WPA.  He was called on to play a prominent role in the Congress of the League of American Writers, along with the leading left wing writers of the country, and heard Earl Browder say that writers had no right \"to go freelancing in the field of sharpest political struggles without accountability to anyone\" -- meaning party functionaries, of course.\n  \"Richard knew,\"  Constance Webb tells us, \"that one of his comrades,  Joseph Freeman, a staunch Communist had been forced by the Party to page is cut off here\n\nappeared and received good notices in both the Party and regular press, Freeman was called before Browder and informed the \"Testament\" had been condemned in Moscow--he had referred to Trotsky as a man instead of referring to him correctly as a class enemy and murderous Fascist.  Browder instructed Freeman to kill the book, and he cancelled all orders from bookshops and called off a scheduled lecture tour.  And Mike Gold called Leo Cherne a traitor for writing \"The Rest of Your Life.\"  The Party attempted to stop the book's sales through a slander campaign.  When his own novel, \"Native Son,\" had been published, Richard had been threatened with expulsion by the Party--even though Browder had said:  \"I see nothing wrong with (\"Native Son\").\"\n\n   My own correspondence of the time with Joseph Freeman is now, along with hundreds of my letters and papers, in the Special Collections archives of the UCLA library and not at hand for quotation here; but I recall that he was trying to make political and psychological sense out of his troubles with the Party, obviously in an effort to keep his years of work in the Party from becoming a haunting nightmare memory for the rest of his life.\n  When I saw Freeman in New York some years later, we walked together for some blocks down Broadway;  his talk about the subject had taken on the character of gallows humor which tended to trail off into hopeless confusion and painful silences.   My lasting impression of him is that of a man who  has been through a horror he can only half believe and prefers not to be reminded of it.  Freeman had grown prematurely old and spent, and when I heard of his death not long after I had the chilling impression that, like Hamlet at the last, he was self-murdered more than slain.\n   Visiting with Wright in Brooklyn shortly after their first child, Julia, was born to his Jewish wife, Ellen, we talked about an article he had published, his first public statement in depth about his break with the Communist Party.  Despite his great care to make it sound like a lover's quarrel, rather than an acrimonious divorce, he was the target of brickbats from BOTH sides of the political arena.  The worst of it was, he found himself being embraced  unwillingly by strange bedfellows.  Not until he went to live in France, in 1946, did he find true understanding of his delicately balanced political position.\n   Nothing was ever easy for Richard, nothing was ever simple.  He was suspicious of simple answers, simple questions.  It is in the nature of enforced interculturation.  In the black American's case, it is more like acculturation, or cultural genocide.  Any choice such a marginal man can make is of necessity an existential choice, as Sartre perceived.\n     The same hard-to-explain complexities and delicately-hung choices characterized his personal as well as his political life.  We went out for an evening in Harlem, to dinner, to the Cotton Club, and every minute of the time was filled with crises, large and small, all of them fraught with unpredictable alternatives--the lot of all black and white intermarriage at that time, all adding up to the unrelenting agony of integration, especially when it takes place on the mattress level.  One hovers perpetually between ecstasy and disaster.\n   Richard's state of mind at the time may be inferred from a piece of prose he was working on, \"The Man Who Lived Underground.\"  A black man has managed to escape from the police station where he had been tortured into confessing to a murder he did not commit, takes refuge  in a sewer, finds a dry, unused, forgotten cave from which it is

patients with lively Scottish tunes while waiting for fillings to set, and for anesthetics to take effect, the National Geographic Society reports.\n  Shrill notes from aloft startled office workers in Washington and New York a few years ago.  It turned out that high-rise construction gangs in both cities included pipers who were practicing at lunchtime.\n  Nobody knows exactly how many pipers there are in the United States, but the ancient art of bagpiping is more popular than ever, the society says.  President Johnson has signed a bill ending a 15 per cent duty on imported bagpipes and parts.\n   Lively skirls inspire college football teams, brighten parades, and enliven the meetings of fraternal organizations.\n   Bagpipes seem to attract musicians regardless of origin or sex.  An all-girl band from the University of Iowa won rave notices at guest appearances in Scotland.\n   The shrill wail of the pipes does [sic]  appeal to everyone, however.  \"At its best, mighty barbarous music,\" Samuel Pepys, the English diarist, grumbled.  \n   Those with unappreciative ears may not believe it, but there are three distinctive types of bagpipe music.  The Ceol Baeg, or Little Music, consists of dance and march tunes, and the Ceol Meadonach, or Middle Music, includes slow marches, retreats, and simple laments.  The majestic  Ceol Mor, or Big Music, lends itself to great sonatas and concertos.\n    The most famous of all Highland musicians, the MacCrimmons, hereditary pipers to the MacLeods of Dunvegan on the Isle of Skye, wrote, taught, and played the Ceol Mor, scorning the simpler forms of compositions.\n    The MacCrimmon recipe for a good player was seven years of study, backed up by seven generations of pipers in the family.  To test a student, one of the MacCrimmons supposedly wrote the notes of a tune on wet sand, and the novice was expected to play it faultlessly before the tide washed in.\n    \n\nDear Jack.\narrow to the left pointing to the newspaper clipping  1st RIOTS, marches, Sit-ins. ?Singings?, School Seizures -- And NOW \"bag-pipes\"!\nO Tempora  O mores.\nJoe D NN","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":123152,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/123152","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/049b25b408b828fc313850a78bb6f97c.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/049b25b408b828fc313850a78bb6f97c.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/049b25b408b828fc313850a78bb6f97c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/049b25b408b828fc313850a78bb6f97c.jpg"},"added":"2023-01-04T22:14:07+00:00","modified":"2023-04-05T03:52:39+00:00","filename":"049b25b408b828fc313850a78bb6f97c.jpg","authentication":"a43f13eb82ddad25e863e63de441183c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"992006198805867_midwest_ms_conroy_box_00007_fl_00382_000031.jpg","size":298287,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1608,"resolution_y":2000,"compression_ratio":0.0309169776119402987812900818198613706044852733612060546875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00007], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230103","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00007], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230103","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00007], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230103","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1426,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1426","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"May 24 1968      note in upper right margin:  Over  with arrow pointing to corner of page\nDear Jack.\n\n    I recall the time when Algren and Conroy didn't have $6,000 between them!

Had he been pickled to the gills and offered his surrender to the sainted Lee many of our current problems could have been averted.\n  We have been supplying the South with foreign aid ever since and would probably have to do so after the Confederacy was re-established, but it would be well worth the price to rid Washington of the Strom Thurmonds, the Wilbur Millses, Eastlands, Fulbrights and Towers.\n   I would, however, trade Florida even up for California since Gov. Kirk is only a passing fad, if not an aberration, and basically the state is sound.\n   The leading statesmen of the new Confederacy would be George Wallace and Wonderful Wonnie Weagan, whose philosophy is closely patterned after that of Jeff Davis.\n   Of course, we can't expect Utopia until the 19th Amendment granting equal rights to women is repealed and the voting age is increased to at least  45, but admitting we were wrong at Appomattox would do much to  heal our woes.\n\nChicago   J.C.\nin ink:  Aug 26 1968 \"CGo Daily News\"\narrows pointing to newspaper clipping   Nice little essay.

The sentence of death was passed back on Jan. 10, but such is the process of publishing - once the issue of a magazine has entered the cycle it is unstoppable and irreversible - that it had to stay alive, though doomed, for four more weeks.  Actually, however, the old and once venerable Post had been living for years on transfusion, transplant and artificial respiration - on borrowed time.  The sentence was a formality.\n\n  THE EDITOR of the Saturday Evening Post during its last era of prosperity was Ben Hibbs.  He retired in 1961, at the end of 20 years in the editorial chair, an lives now in a colonnaded, three-story house of Pennsylvania field stone in the low hills west of Philadelphia, 15 minutes by commuter train from the Post's old headquarters onIndependence Square.\n   One day recently -- while the final officers and owners were at last deciding that the Post should become one with Liberty and Collier's --- Hibbs talked at some length about the Post of the earlier days, about its great editor George Horace Lorimer, and about his own editorship.\n  All about him were reminders  of those happier years:  Originals of Post covers, portraits of former President Eisenhower (Hibbs, as a senior editor for the Reader's Digest, now edits Eisenhower's manuscripts and assists him in his writing);  Post cartoons; books that were extracted from Post stories and, on one wall in his downstairs study, a testimonial to his editorship, a placard stating that the circulation of his last issue of the magazine was 7,085,000, the highest in the magazine's history and twice the circulation of his first number, in early 1942.\n   HIBBS AT 67 is spare, ruddy, active, deliberate in his speech, his manner still touched by the American freshness and innocence of the Kansas plains where he was born and raised.\n   As a newspaperman he became known as the most quoted \"young squirt\" in Kansas journalism, and it was probably this local eminence that set him  on the path to national fame.  He moved to Philadelphia in 1929 as an associate editor of the Country Gentlemen.  He became it s editor in 1940.\n   AS a magazine man, then, Hibbs grew up in the quiet, polite, almost courtly environment of Philadelphia and \"The Gray Lady of Independence Square,\" long before the new management moved the office to New York.\n   The Post in those years was big, though it had once been small.\n    When Lorimer became its editor, its circulation was less than 3,000, its annual advertising revenue less than $7,000.  But in 1902 the figures were 314,671 and $360,175; in 1927 they were 2,816,391 and $53,144,987.  A late 1929 issue of the Post ran to 272 pages and weighed nearly two pounds, all for five cents (the scrap paper dealers bought it on the newsstands and sold it at a profit).\n THE STORY, in other words, was a success story of the sort Lorimer liked to publish.   In the early days of the century he did publish some unexpected people on unexpected subjects --  Clarence Darrow on the open shop, Capt. Joseph Medill Patterson defending socialism, Leon Trotsky explaining the Russian Revolution -- even though Lorimer's philosophy was conservative Republican.  But he was in tune with his times -- as Hibbs said the other day -- the times of boom, expansion, faith in the everlasting durability and blessing of unleashed free enterprise and the undoubted preeminence of America and Americans among nations and people.\n   At the same time, however, Lorimer published an entertaining magazine.  His fiction was written by some fo the most eminent American writers, serious and light--O. Henry, Jack London, Ring Lardner, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Booth Tarkington, Thomas Wolfe, Gertrude Stein, to mention a few.  \"Lorimer was a brilliant editor,\" Hibbs said, \"and he had the ability to spot a good writer....When you look over the writers he discovered and built up and brought along and made vary famous, it's simply astonishing ... The other big Curtis publication was the Ladies' Home Journal, which had an equally strong editor in Edward Bok...I think the dominance of Curtis publications in those years can be ascribed to those two great editors, plus the fact that the man who stared the company and built it, old Cyrus H. K. Curtis, believed implicitly that you must \"give an editor his head, let him do the very best job he could and not interfere.\"\n   BUT TWO THINGS happened to Lorimer and the Post --Depression and Roosevelt--and Lorimer never got over them; the Post suffered acutely before Hibbs and his staff resuscitated it.  Lorimer's policy became harshly anti-New Deal;  he opposed all the reforms; in 1936, his magazine even published an article advocating child labor.   Some Post numbers in the spring of 1930 went over 200 pages each, before the crash caught up with it, but in the summer of 1931 they were below 100, in 1932 below 60.  Lorimer and his Post had lost touch.\n   Lorimer's successor, Wesley W. Stout, who changed none of Lorimer's formula, was out in 1942, and Hibbs in.\n   What Hibbs accomplished has been summarized by Joseph Goulden, in \"The Curtis Caper,\" a history of the Curtis publications.  Referring to both Hibbs and the editors of the Ladies' Home Journal, Bruce and Beatrice Gould, Goulden wrote the the \"established a cordial, affectionate rapport with (Curstis' [sic] ) reason for existence, the American readers.\"\n   HOW HAD Hibbs and his staff done it?\n   \"Oh,\" he said, \"there were so many things in the picture.  In the first place, I think that in those days I had a sort of God-given instinct for what people liked to read.  That's an egotistic thing to say, but I did have -- perhaps because I was one of the people, I was a poor kid, had to work my way through college and so on--I had a feeling, I think, for what interested the great middle-class of America, and I had a very deep feeling about America itself.   My wife always said I have an American flag tattooed on my chest.\n \"AS TO HOW we brought the Post back...One of the early things we did was to cut the length of stuff.  The second was to modernize the magazine, make it look more up-to-date than it had been.   We didn't throw out the good things, as they did later on.   They threw out our cover artists, people like Norman Rockwell, that people loved.\n  \"I always believed deeply in the proper balance in a magazine.  sure, we published a lot of escape reading, (Clarence Buddington Kelland and Erle Stanley Gardner, for instance.  However, I always felt that there had to be a backbone of important material in the Post, to make it a magazine of significance.  We worked very hard at that.\n  \"Of course I came in in the early days of the war, and the war dominated the magazine for the next 3\u00bd  years.\"  (Among the Post's war corresspondents  [sic] were such writers as as [sic] Edgar Snow, Richard Tregaskis, MacKinlay Kantor and C. S. Forester, and some of its fiction during the Hibbs era was written by Stephen Vincent Benet, John P. Marquand, William  Faulkner and the like, in addition to its \"popular\" writers).  \"After the war we branched out into all sorts of things to keep this backbone of important information and important opinion in...Part of it, too, was just hard work.  I always brought home a briefcase full of manuscripts.  I read, I suppose, every week two or three times as much as appeared in the magazine.  But we did it; we got the Post healthy again.\n   \"IT'S BEEN SAID I ran a conservative magazine.  All right.  I'm what Ike and I call middle-of-the-road conservative, a little bit to the right of the middle.  My political philosophy dominated our editorial page, but it did not dominate the rest of the magazine...We did keep the thing wide open to a wide gamut of opinion...I knew Norman Thomas rather well, but that was a little too far left.  We never did have any sacred cows, with the exception of the matter of decency.  I always believed that the Post was a family magazine that would lie on the people's reading tables and I didn't want to put something in there that a 12-year-old kid couldn't read with his mother's approval.  We published some very startlingly plain articles on important subjects, but we did it in a decent way.\"  (Among the Post's subjects were the population explosion and birth control, and the civil rights movement.)\n  SPEAKING OF     12-year-old boys -- they used to sell the Post, didn't they?  To what extent did the magazine depend on them?\n  \"It was a relatively minor thing,\" Hibbs said.  \"The big thing was subscriptions and next in line were the newsstand sales....But it was a wonderful public relations gimmick.  Those appealing kids!  And even today I get letters from successful men saying, 'I sold the Post when I was a boy.'  We had to end the boys' sales operation in the early years of World War II...We could get the kids, but we couldn't get the adult organizers and the cars and the gasoline, and so we had to throw those copies on the newsstand.   They were quickly absorbed.\n  \"But it was hard on the kids.  I remember getting a letter from one of those boys.  He identified himself as a 12-year-old Post salesman.  I think Papa helped him write it.  He said, 'I notice that the Post quite occasionally publishes articles in behalf of the small business man.  I am a small businessman and you've just put me out of business.' \"\n   In the early days the kids and the newsstands sold he Post for five cents a copy, and it was even cheaper by subscription.  Wasn't that virtually giving it away?\n  \"You're so right,\" Hibbs said.  \"This is one of the things in which I could preach you a sermon, on the screwy economics  of the magazine business.  Today they're getting more of the revenue out of the readers.  (The final number of the Post will cost you 50 cents on the newsstand).  But in my day, the theory was that you published a magazine at considerably less than it cost you, thereby building a huge circulation that appealed to advertisers.  You hoped to get most of  your revenue out of advertising.  For the 20 years I was editor of the Post it worked beautifully.\n  \"THEN THE TIME came when the advertising agencies--you know advertising agencies are sheep, a few of the big ones start doing something and they all start running in the same direction -- some of the big advertising agencies decided that the Post was no longer what in advertising jargon they call the hot book.  In the meantime, television had come into the picture and taken a great big slice of the advertising pie.  So things got a little skimpy in the advertising field, and they got more skimpy in my last year, and since then you know what's happened.\"\n   What had happened, perhaps, was that all America had changed, Lorimer's era was an era of heroes, wasn't it -- Lindbergh, Babe Ruth?\n   \"Yes.  Something's happened to the heroes these days.  There don't seem to be any more of them.\"  (Higgs said in a speech once, \"For in those other days there were giants...\")\n  BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY  -- was the passing of the Post like the passing of Collier's in 1957?  Hibbs once said that \"editorial independence to a large extent went down the drain at  the house of Crowell long years before the final collapse of the publications themselves...Someone from the business office was always looking over their shoulders.  Things often were done editorially solely to attract advertising -- always a vain procedure and in the end usually a fatal mistake...\"  Did something of the sort happen to the Post after 1961?\n  \"Can't you say,\" Hibbs said, \"that I smiled and said, 'No comment?' \"\n   He did smile, and he did not comment.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":123169,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/123169","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/1eaf7f41e8de420dbe97235b0fd8f3ef.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/1eaf7f41e8de420dbe97235b0fd8f3ef.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/1eaf7f41e8de420dbe97235b0fd8f3ef.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1eaf7f41e8de420dbe97235b0fd8f3ef.jpg"},"added":"2023-01-04T22:14:17+00:00","modified":"2023-04-07T18:37:51+00:00","filename":"1eaf7f41e8de420dbe97235b0fd8f3ef.jpg","authentication":"72382d194530543229d2b31e95aa7e9c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"992006198805867_midwest_ms_conroy_box_00007_fl_00382_000055.jpg","size":382919,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1556,"resolution_y":2000,"compression_ratio":0.04101531705227078050679523357757716439664363861083984375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00007], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230103","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00007], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230103","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00007], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230103","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1426,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1426","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"19 March '69.\nDear Jack - Hi!\n\n   As the Saint-Beuxe of Missouri you should have the enclosed item on Chas.

Farrar, Straus & Giroux $15\nBy Frederic E. Faverty\n\n  Like Lord Byron and Oscar Wilde, his flamboyant predecessors, Hart Crane the man  continues to excite more interest than his works.\n  John Unterecker believes strongly that the life illuminates the works and, where possible, he shows the interrelationships.  Before the man has faded \"into his legend,\" Unterecker attempts the elusive, and what he knows to be the ultimately impossible, task of discovering the \"true\" Hart Crane.  All that a biographer can do, he does.  He recreates the 1900-1932 American background.  He uses the family papers, particularly the voluminous correspondence by and to Crane.  And he interviews the surviving friends and acquaintances.\n   First, the legend.  Unterecker wants to de-emphasize the impression of Crane as a man who, though a genius, was also a high-school drop-out, a homosexual and a lush, whose \"lyric evenings\" too often ended with him dead drunk in the streets or engaged in orgies with sailors on the wharves or bums in the park;  the man who, in his binges, insulted his friends and threw typewriters out of second-story windows; the neurotic who, after repeatedly threatening suicide, jumped to his death from the deck of a ship in 1932.\n   ALL SUCH EPISODES AND SCENES are subordinated to the main purpose: the picture of the serious artist beset with psychological, social, financial and other problems.  For Unterecker realizes that the anecdote does not always define the man.  It sometimes distorts and falsifies him.\n   Unterecker is strongest in his grasp of character.  Crane's family relationships were such a psychological and psychiatric tangle that they would have daunted Freud, Jung and Adler.  To the author's credit, he does not resort to psychiatric jargon.  He allows the participants to analyze themselves and each other in the full and frequent correspondence.  Was the father at fault -- the big business tycoon who could not accept until too late his son's obsession with literature?  Crane himself  says that his relations with his father \"are better explained in the science of psychoanalsyis [sic] than in common language.\"  Why was his beautiful mother unable to sever the umbilical cord?  Why did Crane's love have to turn to hate before he could free himself from her dream of \"success.\"\n  As far as possible, Crane is allowed to tell his own story in his lively letters and in relevant extracts from his works, which also serve to explain Crane's theories on art and literature.  He valued personality as highly as ideas in literature.  He was more interested in the sound of words than in their meaning.   He derived more pleasure from reading a thesaurus than a newspaper.  His letters show that he regarded his poetry as the expression of a \"vision\" to offset the negation of such contemporary works as T. S. Eliot's \"The Wasteland.\"\n   THE BOOK IS A GOOD EXAMPLE, too, of biography as history.  Especially notable are the vivid and authentic accounts of small-town life in Ohio in the early 20th Century; of Cleveland during World War I and after; of Greenwich Village camaraderie in the 1920s, and of exotic Mexico as seen by Guggenheim fellows in the early 1930s.\n   The last chapter, devoted to interviews with Crane's surviving friends -- critic Malcolm Cowley, novelist Waldo Frank, philospher [sic] Mony Grunberg, among others -- was the basis of an instructive program on national television.  Each friend has his own explanation:  a materialistic society, his family or Mexico -- these drove Crane to suicide.\n   So, too, on his personality and his contribution to the world.  Frank is impressed most by Crane's \"mystic vision.\"  Charmian von Wiegand remembers chiefly the demonic element in his personality and works.  Unterecker takes no sides.  He presents all the views and allows the reader to form his own judgments.\n   \nIn Italics  Frederic E. Faverly is Morrison professor of English at Northwestern University.\n\nDuring the summer months book reviews are appearing in Showcase and Wednesday's Family Magazine to supplement special seasonal issues of Book Week.

CULVER PICTURES\nDown But Not Out\nHARD TIMES by Studs Terkel.  462 pages.  Pantheon.  $8.95\n\n   The Great Depression!  In these troubled times, how could more words about those troubled times become a national bestseller?   The answer is that Studs Terkel's omnifaceted study of the last major societal breakdown in the U.S. seems remarkably relevant to 1970.  For those who despair fo the system, there is the sobering view of what ensues when the system collapses.  For those who cannot understand why the system inspires so much dissent, there is a harrowing display of America's ingrown inequities.\n  A celebrated Chicago radio journalist, Terkel has put the Depression back together from the fragmentary impressions and memories of more than 150 farmers, philanthropists, hobos, hoodlums, New Dealers and even a nude dancer whom he interviewed Each one tells a story in a series of snippets that together miraculously re-create the age--at once petrified and alive--on paper.  The views are often contradictory and thus all the more real.  \"We all had an understanding that it wasn't our fault.  Nobody made us feel ashamed,\" recalls one poor white Southern girl.  In another passage, a Chicago door-to-door salesman remembers it differently:  \"Shame?  You tellin' me?  I would bend my head low so nobody would recognize me.  The only scar it left on me is my pride, my pride.\"\n   Accurate Jumps.  The use of many voices also provides great breadth.  Sally Rand gives some flavor of the times, and herself, when she notes:  \"Friends of mine who had been to Harvard, Yale and Princeton jumped out of windows.  With accuracy.\"   The insularity of the rich sometimes speaks in the person of a psychiatrist.  The most wonderful  kind of servants could be had for a pittance, he recalls.  \"That's when people were peddling apples and breadlines were forming.  But on the whole, don't forget, the highest unemployment was less than 20%.\"  A Chicago M.D. with many patients among laboring men remembers things differently.  \"People starved on the street.  Every day somebody would faint on a streetcar.  I remember an ominous march down Michigan Avenue one day.  It was about '34.  A very silent, scraggly march of the unemployed.  Nobody said anything.  Just a mass of people flowing down that street.  In their minds, I think a point was reached:  We're not gonna take it any more.\"\n   Most piercing and illuminating are the small details still perfectly recollected.  People who were once children at the head of a soup line remember that they learned to beg the ladler for a deep stir so they would not get only flavored water.  Women began appearing on that once all-male mode of transport, the freight car.  A petty thief, lacking a gun for a sudden job, knew that corruption was so rampant that he could borrow the needed weapon from a cop on patrol.  At farm foreclosure sales, friends would gather, bid 10c for every item, scare others out of bidding more, then give everything back to he farmer.   And in his mother's hotel, Terkel, then in his teens, sensed that the Depression had set in for keeps when he noticed the increased wear on the cards and checkerboards available to guests sitting around the lobby.\n A Sense of Time.  Like any good interviewer, Terkel lets his subjects talk for themselves:  the book is his by virtue of the editing, organizing and selection that he has done with obvious intelligence and careful restraint.  As history, the book may be weak on the why, but Terkel's many-voiced chronicle can hardly be matched by any scholarly work in giving a sense of what it was all like at the time.\n\nJos\u00e9 M.

That slip began in May 1961 and ended in August 1969.\n   I'm sure that for several years I had been a good AA member.  I must have been, because I was elected Delegate from Missouri to the General Service Conference in 1952.  If I hadn't been sincere, I would not have been elected.  As to what happened, I don't know, but at some time I started forgetting all AA contacts, meetings, Twelfth Step work, continued inventory, and everything I had learned that was important to a recovering alcoholic.\n   The reasons why I started drinking aren't important.  The important thing is that I now have a little over two years' sobriety again.  I now attend two or three meetings per week and realize t heir importance.

When an assassin's bullet cut him down in his own statehouse, Huey Long was reaching for the White House.  This novel is the study of the rise to power of a man like \"The Kingfisher,\" his demagoguery, his coterie of courtiers, his women, his fatal clash with the old order.  The book won the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nIf these are four books you have meant to read, by all means send the attached order form.  Now is the only time this year that the TIME READING PROGRAM will send them to you for just 25 cents each.\nThe point of this offer is to prove that one can regain lost literary ground with the simple and sensible TIME READING PROGRAM.  This is a much-praised book distribution plan that offers readers the most worthwhile books of modern times--without demanding that you buy any particular number  of volumes.\nThe titles made available to you are a diverse mix of everything which interests perceptive adults -- fiction, biography, philosophy, humor, social science, travel, biology, belles lettres.  Offerings include Nabokov's [[italics:  Bend Sinister,] Dylan Thomas' italics: The Doctor and the Devils, Jenkins' italics:  Elizabeth the Great, Joyce's [[italics: A Portrait of the Artist,] Mencken's italics:  In Defense of Women, von Frisch's italics:  Man and the Living World.  Permanence, readability and intellectual enrichment are the criteria which guide the editors of TIME in their selection.  They preface each book and place it in its context as a classic.  An authority in the book's field is commissioned to write an introduction which encapsules the book's purpose, background and import.\nTo receive the four-book set pictured above, just mail the postpaid order form.   There will be no obligation to keep the books; you may read them for 10 days free.  If you do retain them, you pay only $1.  You will then receive a new package of four books every other month on a 10 day approval basis.  But you need not keep any sets at all;  those you keep are only $4.95 per set, plus postage and handling.  You may cancel the entire Program at any time.

H. Foley, and is also one of the favorite \"sights\" in Phoenix Park; for, unlike Wellington, Gough was popular in Ireland, and particularly in Dublin.  One reason for this was that he habitually abstained from meddling with politics, and the other, that, although a British General, he was always proud of his Irish birth and blood.  He was a native of Woodstown, County Limerick, Ireland, and was born Nov. 3, 1770, and entered the military service of England, as ensign, at the early age of fifteen.  He participated in the campaign against the Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope, and was with the forlorn hope of the 87th Royal Irish Fusiliers (the \"Faugh-a-Ballaghs\") at Porto Rico.  He served with high distinction in the Peninsular war, and was severely wounded at Talavera.  Wellington held him in high esteem, and he was promoted lieutenant-colonel on the field, but did not reach the rank of a general officer until 1830, when he became major-general.  In India, he showed the qualities of a commander of the first class.  he defeated the Mahrattas in a sanguinary campaign, and afterward routed the brave and warlike Sikhs at Moodkee, Ferozeshah and Sobraon.  The old hero died near Dublin, March 2, 1869.\nhandwritten at top of picture  Dear Jack:  Think of this earlier-day MacArthur with such a fine statue - whilst out fellow Reformer, John B.

And so do I.\n\nMary D.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":123228,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/123228","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/82c2ce23889d395b0d7e98e0398a7ff7.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/82c2ce23889d395b0d7e98e0398a7ff7.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/82c2ce23889d395b0d7e98e0398a7ff7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/82c2ce23889d395b0d7e98e0398a7ff7.jpg"},"added":"2023-01-04T22:14:51+00:00","modified":"2023-04-14T19:38:22+00:00","filename":"82c2ce23889d395b0d7e98e0398a7ff7.jpg","authentication":"bb518be73711d51db07fbdd561c63e7e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"992006198805867_midwest_ms_conroy_box_00007_fl_00384_000013.jpg","size":214440,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1548,"resolution_y":2000,"compression_ratio":0.0230878552971576223029614993720315396785736083984375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00007], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230103","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00007], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230103","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00007], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230103","imls c"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1426,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1426","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"in pencil at top of page:  Diggles, Mary\n12\/15\/79\nDear Jack\nThanks for your card and note.  I had been browsing thru Joe's favorite book, ' The Decline of the West\" and came across the enclosed by the late Hoke Norris.  I knew I would write you anyway, to inform you of my retirement.  Frank Walsh helped me write this - did most of it, naturally - and I've had fun with it for a large number of people didn't understand it.\n\n   I saw Stephen Wade last July at the start of his electrifying career.  I don't know how he keeps his freshness night after night.  He mentioned you when starting his Fast Sooner Hound story and a man beside me - who later identified himself as a teacher  & a Conroy admirer - started to clap.

Moreover the police here have the underlined: correct names and addresses of all those in and around the movement here, and also of those who were active five or six months ago.  Needless to say there is a stool pigeon in our ranks who is very, very clever.  He was among the twelve whom we were with at Glenn's beer joint because the officals [sic] here know all about that.

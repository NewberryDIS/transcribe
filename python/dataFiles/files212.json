he was moreover rather wild - during his lucid intervals he did pray and ask his father to pray for him- but that was only a death bed repentance  - yet I believe they have hopes in his salvation - but they are in great grief - Mary Watson's baby was brought here and buried on Monday - that was a sad stroke, very sudden and they are prostrated in sorrow - it is hard to lose a first & only child.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":47837,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/47837","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/5c7bf7462cf1ad46650ab6e90c268d31.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/5c7bf7462cf1ad46650ab6e90c268d31.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/5c7bf7462cf1ad46650ab6e90c268d31.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5c7bf7462cf1ad46650ab6e90c268d31.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-09T16:28:54+00:00","modified":"2020-05-08T17:24:27+00:00","filename":"5c7bf7462cf1ad46650ab6e90c268d31.jpg","authentication":"c0226e6ca9f87bad9fa718ff1f9b5c7f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_le_moyne_box_01_fl_12_20_04_o2.jpg","size":1054444,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2341,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041705981932381},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171101"],"TimeCreated":["232500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["163916"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171101"],"TimeCreated":["232500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["163916"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171101"],"TimeCreated":["232500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["163916"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5c7bf7462cf1ad46650ab6e90c268d31.jpg","FileDateTime":1510244697,"FileSize":1054444,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2341\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2341,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:11:02 14:04:13","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:11:01 23:25:00","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:11:01 23:25:00","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2243,"ExifImageLength":3449,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":212,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/212","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Frank reached Philadelphia Thursday morning and has a pleasant boarding house on Girard Street -

20\"\nVery dear Johnny-  I hope you are all well & happy and enjoying the merry excitements of the season Lessons of recreation are useful indeed necessary to all and should be encouraged especially should the poor & laboring classes be provided with relaxation and comfort. so the season of gifts is not to be overlooked - Our children, great & small, are anticipating much enjoyment and many happy surprises. it is quite long unclear to hear the determinations beforehand that there is to be no giving, except to the children, but before the day actually arrives, every one is busy sewing, knitting, or something - one is making a night cap, another a collar. or an apron or bowing a ribbon - but tho a trifle, it is something to please, both the giver and reciever - and then so many secrets are to be kept - and so many hearty laughs at the way Ma Keeps a secret which is not the best they think - then Fanny tells Grandma, what she has got for Aunt Sis","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":47881,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/47881","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/014ba04c6ae9b630c5360db22353f66a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/014ba04c6ae9b630c5360db22353f66a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/014ba04c6ae9b630c5360db22353f66a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/014ba04c6ae9b630c5360db22353f66a.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-09T16:30:42+00:00","modified":"2020-05-10T18:25:05+00:00","filename":"014ba04c6ae9b630c5360db22353f66a.jpg","authentication":"7da454f178a68bbefb1fe47bf3bdfad7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_le_moyne_box_01_fl_12_29_02_o2.jpg","size":1169028,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

but must condense upon a page - Jane has probably told you that we are just now enjoying a visit from Sarah & her children- she has her nurse too - Charlotte & babe on a Mary Cape? are here also so you see we have a goodly family to see to - considering we have no girl - ours having left us quite unexpectedly on Saturday - but Mary helps and we get along quite nicely - and Pa is quietly well and  pleasant, which after all is the principal thing - I am so sorry, so very sorry, he does not let Jane go to you we are all very anxious about it and very willing to go but what can we do, dear John - unclear he may change My poor dear Charlotte came home quite sick and feeble with a very bad cold & cough, and quite discouraged about herself- she had a great deal of fever and no appetite - We are doing all we can to patch her up, and Pa is gibing her medicine so I hope she may recover, but she has no stamina and can endure nothing - I told her when she went she might not do it and that it was at the risk of her life - you know she is not very prudent.  Why could not Julia come to us- we would do all we could to make her comfortable - I think it would be good economy in you to have her make a visit of 3 months at that time instead of later in the season - to all her friends - you could either shut up house or take some small family on board with them - we should be very happy to have either end of the visit - and I do think it could be a good plan  think about it  I suppose Jane has told you every thing -

A matter of 2,300,000 workers of this class remain unemployed so I guess its up to the employed to take off another shirt, if they've got one.

It would be well then to consider our industrial overlords an as armed force and begin the dissarment right here at home before we jump across borders.  Parents should be discouraged in the arming of their children with toy pistols in the mistaken thought that they will become successful highway men or gangsters and in as much as these both the children and industrial overlairds are equally irresponcible, it would be well for responcible  parties to shake them down for the hardware before the dance begins Pistols are no part democracy. \nIt might be argued that employers are armed in self defense and that it is therefor they need all that heavy artillery, but it seems to me that such a condition is altogether one sided and calls for a distribution of gas masks and bulletproof vests so as to save as many as possible of the breadwinners. I would not go so far as to suggest that United States government should open her arsenals to the working class altho I cannot help but realize in such an event the self-defense would be more equally balanced and the results might prove to be of great interest to the gaping public and much good might result therefrom.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":46988,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/46988","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/8bcb1d1d6020b112422a59b24944d30f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/8bcb1d1d6020b112422a59b24944d30f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/8bcb1d1d6020b112422a59b24944d30f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8bcb1d1d6020b112422a59b24944d30f.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-03T20:49:21+00:00","modified":"2020-07-31T03:29:25+00:00","filename":"8bcb1d1d6020b112422a59b24944d30f.jpg","authentication":"457e6b1f57e15cccd8a2fe6344334192","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_rosemont_slim_box_01_fl_01_026_o2.jpg","size":1540880,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2485,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057414114315523},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20170813"],"TimeCreated":["233034+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20170813"],"TimeCreated":["233034+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20170813"],"TimeCreated":["233034+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8bcb1d1d6020b112422a59b24944d30f.jpg","FileDateTime":1509742097,"FileSize":1540880,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2485\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2485,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:15 10:56:05","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:13 23:30:34","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:13 23:30:34","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":37,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3506,"ExifImageLength":5079,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":208,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/208","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"VIII\nJohn L. Lewis and his twelve apostles placed a union on I.W.W.'s doorstep-Heluva joke to play on the boss? Now all we have to do is bring the child in. The child of course is slightly dazed, as a result of the seperately ending agreements and doesn't know who its father and mother is. So I guess we'll have to adopt the child and give it a respectable home. Seperately ending agreements might at first blush appear to be loss of generalship on the part of John L. Lewis. That is not so however; it is a tactic. John is teaching the boys to learn from mistakes. I.W.W. however has the complete pattern and is impervious to mistakes...Workers however should not be criticized too severely for making mistakes. Mistakes will happen to almost any of us. Errors are a peculiar thing-even law recognizes that errors will happen. There is no law that will convict an honest to goodness error. Law requires that errors be proven intentional-that of course is impossible because then it would not be an error. So I guess we'll just have to let it pass that the boys made a mistake. CIO has been having tough luck in the State of Maine among the lumber workers and it is believed a little help from the outside would bring it into the fold and make of Bangor a winter capital for the I.W.W.-120 might consider this and send one of their best pulp wood makers to survey the stand. Press would have us believe peace and war between labor and capital hinged on the artfull machinations of one Mr. Mc Grady; that if Mc Grady performed peace would be born but if he felt indisposed wars would break out between this famous pair.

example here that sticks out is modicum of job-control secured by several of the seperate unions in several industries in part. Job-control is OK in itself but when the control is divided as between several competing unions it is not of the value to the working class that it should be and enters as a weapon in the hands of the employer in the sense that he can perpetuate the divisions in workers ranks by tossing his patronage to whatever union at will\nNLRB election doesn't apply because of the employers habit of weeding-out recalcitrants and replacing them with new-blood of whatever proper type he chooses. \nAnother employer may foster an entirely different union (hiring at their hall) etc and so a three (4) point split is created in workers ranks and no happy landing.\nDid the workers first organize a ONE union before they \"went in for job-control\" then the weapon would be in workers hands instead of the employers \nThe present amount of job-control, if in the hands of one union, would swing the rest in line and the victory would be complete without further adoo or stuttering.\nCoordination of job-control is not the remedy.

How it got there is beside the point. The point is the goodly Church did disgorge most of it and, be it said to the everlasting glory of Uncle Sam that he used only moral suasion.\nIt seems the Church is not averse to \"laying by\" a little for a rainy day, contradicting the old saying \"tomorrow takes care of itself.\" It seems then that riches is not dross to the church but only to the sinners and that the altar gold is impervious to fire and is not corroded by rust. (or corrupted by greed)--\nBut it would seem fitting and, crossed out logical that if the worshipers most of needs dwell in hovels and shacks that it is fitting that, crossed out the house of the Lord shall also be a hovel and a shack. (Please do not tell me all the worshipers would not fit in a shack. You have no premise. Count rather the empty pews, empty sermons and empty heads--way down south the whole congregation fits in a shack and the number of worshipers exceeds the \"attendance\" of a gilded, marblefront cathedral.)-\nThe east of the cathedral would properly house the whole of the congregation. Amen.\nSo that's where the money went?

But I notice a move on foot to curb that militaney or neutralize its beneficial effect upon the organization. In a recent issue of their publication the \"National office must again remind you that the program of efficiency and economy is not being carried out.\" \nIt seems the membership in some parts held special meeting recommending that Dispatchers be placed on payroll, Janitors pay be raised and stenographers be hired. All these are a necessary part of a militant union that wants to grow and retain its self respect and the respect of the thousands still unorganized. There is no excuse profits especially in view of the fact the membership was using its own money and finally, membership knows best being directly in contact with any condition that may obtain in the several ports.\nI see further \"the National Council at its last meeting passed a resolution that the National Maritime Union, as such, would not tolerate any longer any members carrying books of dual and hostile unions.

Mr. Meyers should be discouraged in the making of such remarks because they destroy the confidence we never had. \n\"Well\", says the bum, spose I'll have to go out and pull grass, and that is burnt up, by the drowth, everything is burnt up including generosity; that's because of delegated charity. The delegation of the power of charity into other hands serves the purpose of caring for the needy - plus graft. It's the putting of the additional cost on the donors, the maintenance of gentry who commericialized human misery-heartless monsters. \nSo, Mr. Meyer is not allowed to dish out the sad remains of his delicious stew?\nFor some time we have noticed the merchants goose stepping to the tune of the Commercial Club but we did not think the regimentation had gone so far.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":47046,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/47046","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/2a7d54c0d87ff7409add9288af581ec0.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/2a7d54c0d87ff7409add9288af581ec0.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/2a7d54c0d87ff7409add9288af581ec0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2a7d54c0d87ff7409add9288af581ec0.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-03T20:51:38+00:00","modified":"2020-04-13T13:57:25+00:00","filename":"2a7d54c0d87ff7409add9288af581ec0.jpg","authentication":"3efde43c2015babb669d48214ba63461","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_rosemont_slim_box_01_fl_02_010_o2.jpg","size":1321140,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2874,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042563596999923},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20170813"],"TimeCreated":["234017+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20170813"],"TimeCreated":["234017+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20170813"],"TimeCreated":["234017+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"2a7d54c0d87ff7409add9288af581ec0.jpg","FileDateTime":1509742099,"FileSize":1321140,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2874\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2874,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:15 10:57:51","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:13 23:40:17","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:13 23:40:17","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1937,"ExifImageLength":2426,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":208,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/208","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"philosopher: \"He dares not embrace truth and fondles half truths to hide his inferiority complex ( I don't like that  last  word but philosopher complex (I don't like that last word but philosofers prefer it to the last one I had on the tip of my finger.\"  P.

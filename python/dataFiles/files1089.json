The children walked out with their Father.  At 4  Oclock a very large drove of horses went by going to Camp.  I think there must have more than a thousand.  The Calvary of soldiers passed in the morning - they are a very large regiment.  Also a regiment of Soldiers passed about 11 Oclock.  There is still great fear in regard to Kentucky.  The battle is weekly expected in Kentucky, Missouri and Washington City besides there is all the time weekly skirmishes going on, and small battles somewhere.  These are frightful times and will be the bloodiest war ever on record.  The armies are powerful in number both Northern & Southern - one fighting for their rights as they term it and the Northern fighting to sustain the Government.  My birthplace, Charleston South Carolina was the beginning of this present trouble.  There has long been unkind feelings between the North & South in regard to the Slavery question.  I fear this will be the final liberation of the blacks and they will never be as happy and cared for as now.\nMonday Oct 14 1861\nAnother charming morning we are all in very fine health.  My mother talks of going away tonight.  I insisted on Ma staying another day and she consented.  At 12 Oclock Mr. Mattie and all my children went riding in a Hack then took a ride in the State cars and another ride in the Madison Cars.  We had a long ride.  We dined at 2:00, and after dinner Pa and I went shopping.  I bought Ma Chenille net for her hair.  After Tea Mr. Badger, Pa & Belle & Eva unclear to the Theatre to see Hackett play - Falstaff at nine Oclock.  Father Badger, Aunt Lizzie Crutts? Octavius, Ella John and Licinia Hilton all came by to see Ma - she had retired.\nTuesday Oct 15, 1861 \nWeather still beautiful.  All quite well this morning.  I think Ma will go tonight.  We are all very well.  At 4 the unclear in full troop passed our house.  Mr. And Mrs. Belcher came to see me.  At 8 Oclock Ma started to Louisville.  We all went to Depot  to see her off, even the baby went.  She has much courage to travel by herself with Little Mattie unclear.  But she took a unclear to see us and she returned with a bad cold.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":74208,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/74208","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f4ef62a1cf53ad093a31564466267322.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f4ef62a1cf53ad093a31564466267322.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f4ef62a1cf53ad093a31564466267322.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f4ef62a1cf53ad093a31564466267322.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-11T18:50:50+00:00","modified":"2020-03-29T00:08:08+00:00","filename":"f4ef62a1cf53ad093a31564466267322.jpg","authentication":"6a471cfe741d83b91f2cdf264069bdef","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":45,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_02_048_o2.jpg","size":1109483,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2349,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.043733464200684},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180103"],"TimeCreated":["164336"],"Credit":["838002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180103"],"TimeCreated":["164336"],"Credit":["838002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180103"],"TimeCreated":["164336"],"Credit":["838002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f4ef62a1cf53ad093a31564466267322.jpg","FileDateTime":1531334995,"FileSize":1109483,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2349\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2349,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"16mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:04 11:41:26","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:03 16:43:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:03 16:43:36","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":94,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2435,"ExifImageLength":3731,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803254,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1089,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1089","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Wednesday Oct 16. 1861\nIt poured rain last night - and is very wet this morning - we are all in fine health - but feel the loss of Ma this morning.

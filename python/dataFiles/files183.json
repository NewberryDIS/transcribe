I feel very, very sorry, sorry that you are so disappointed in your school, outings, prospects & enjoyments. I feared that it would be so in part; for I know that much of your enjoyment last year at Marietta was in your personal & family friends. I was afraid you would miss them too much now. But I will tell you how to do. You must \"grin & bear it.\" I know you can grin well enough but whether you can bear it with a good grace is another question. I wish I could see you grin once. I'd grin back again & woo you, grin-to-grin for a while I \"reckon\". Now chin up old hearty. I feel in real cracking spirits. I have just been writing to Sarah, & that is always as good as a dose of exhilirating gas to me. I was real sober when I commenced, but slowly I grew buoyant, til now I am through, I could sail away the clouds in a canoe made of moonshine & fancy, I am so light. Now my brother, I am satisfied of one thing, that is, that the feelings I cherish for her are as deep, as the profoundest depths of the  human soul. Dont you have one fear that when she is mine, my whole life, strength, mind & heart will not be devoted to her happiness. I feel that I shall have but one thought, wish, aspiration & hope. That will be to make her happy. Our past acquaintance has not been pleasant as we could wish, but it has been occasioned by her unconquerable devotion to her departed our x the peculiar feelings that has inspired in her. No devotee of religion cherishes anything with a more profound respect that I regard these feelings of hers. She is but slightly aware of the depth & strength of this respect in my heart. Her devotion to him is the grounds of my hopes in her.

She shall tell you when she has proved me, that she has no feelings that are not respected with a woman's tenderness by me. Judge me by your own heart. You cannot love with more constancy than, nor cherish for Sarah's worth a higher estimate than I. Would then, Sarah not be safe in the hands of one who loved her & esteemed her as you do? But about your school. I cannot but believe that it will improve & be a good school. I know you are giving most perfect satisfaction & that you know is what Raymond never did. But if it should not go; never mind. That is only a little part of the world. Come out west here & start on your own hook, or anybody's hook you please, or go to preaching, or get you a little prairie farm, or do anything else you please. You need not fear, But your school will go. I feel it in my bones. When did you ever fail to make a school go? If you could get the Trustees to bestir themselves enough to get you a snug little aparatus, philosophical, chemical & mathematical it would add much to your means of success. Runup them a little.   Br Bartlett don't preach to suit you! Well, from all accounts it would suit  me as little as you. I abominate the idea that a murderer may swing from the gallows into an equal heaven with the highest  saint. It is stark old orthodoxy! Only orthodoxy would a tear or two unclear by the fear of hell.  That was a sufficient bridge from the gallows to heaven. The principle is essentially the same as relates to the future whither held by orthodox or Universalist, and equally objectionable in either case  to my Mind. I have this week been writing a sermon on that very point, to preach next Sabbath morning.  In ten years I think the whole body of the Christian world will be much more nearly right on that point. I know Universalists are progressing rapidly. Five years ago we had not a paper contrasting for the right on that point. Now we have 5 or 6, and only three maintaining the old view. The truth must come out. I have no fears for her.  Every week my prospects look better here. I believe I shall establish myself firmly here by and by; by myself I mean my cause.

Fastidiousness does not necessarily belong to refinement, yea it is in my mind a species of vulgarity. Now havent I said it? Oh, what a comforter! Are you a little touched? But look at it coolly. Refinement is a noble & desirable virtue; but from refinement there are roads that lead both ways, one to coarsness, the other to fastidiousness; which is preferable I will not  undertake to say. But I know both are wrong. I dont question your refinement. I know you are one of the most refined men I have ever seen, I mean truly, nobly refined. But I have candidly queried with myself whether you have added to your faith that degree of Christian charity that is desirable (\"But the greatest of these is charity\" underlined.)

You know very well that most uneducated persons like it best. My opinion is that many ministers do it to avoid labor. I have preached much extemporaneously, but seldom to my satisfaction. But often when I have felt most dissatisfied, others have thought I preach the best they had ever heard me. Now be patient & try & be happy & grow in spiritual growth.  And try & make Sarah happy.  Do not complain to her about the preaching, nor anything else if you can avoid it. She has troubles of her own enough to bear. It pains me beyond expression to think she is no better satisfied with her meetings. I was afraid it would be so. I knew everything then would be different.

She seems to be well, but tasks herself quite to hard. She seldom retires before 12 o'clock & rises early; goes into school at 7 A.M. & stays till sunset. She complains of a headache frequently. Yet she looks & appears every way in good health. But I know she ? by far too much. But she will not willingly be assisted. She seems determined to do everything herself. I have often passed? her to be assisted, but she sternly refuses.

We must not be worldly in our feelings, but devoted to good. It is a great & good world & wants many faithful laborers for it. Once I was afraid I should not be successful, & should fail in a living in the Ministry. But such fears have vanished. You need not fear. If you were here to day I could furnish you with all the work you could do.  A reputation is soon earned, if one is faithful. If you could have staid in Marietta till this time you would have had one in the Trust that would have been of service to you. I had to earn my standing alone, to work my way up when no voice was raised for Me, among perfect strangers. It was an easy task, & soon done. I have been enabled to put Raymond in a position second to but few if any young men in the Trust. Of course he was able to Maintain it. If he & I can now be of service","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42285,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/42285","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/a8fb59ba66de83e8a72474ed2fdea880.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/a8fb59ba66de83e8a72474ed2fdea880.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/a8fb59ba66de83e8a72474ed2fdea880.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a8fb59ba66de83e8a72474ed2fdea880.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T13:03:34+00:00","modified":"2020-04-22T19:55:13+00:00","filename":"a8fb59ba66de83e8a72474ed2fdea880.jpg","authentication":"3e5b17e70077664974aa7956f822f1d4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_075_005_004_o2.jpg","size":1450147,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2861,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046932146232215997405656793262096471153199672698974609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170803"],"TimeCreated":["010128"],"Credit":["134252"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170803"],"TimeCreated":["010128"],"Credit":["134252"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170803"],"TimeCreated":["010128"],"Credit":["134252"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a8fb59ba66de83e8a72474ed2fdea880.jpg","FileDateTime":1509454885,"FileSize":1450147,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2861\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2861,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:04 11:17:41","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333332999803833018859222647733986377716064453125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:03 01:01:28","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:03 01:01:28","ShutterSpeedValue":4.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":29,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3233,"ExifImageLength":4067,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":183,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/183","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"to you, how gladly shall we do it.

My Mother set the example & every body has followed it, some at a great distance it is true. True spirits are cradled in the storm. Christ's lulliby song was sung amid the roar of the old world's dissolving ruins. His couch was spread in a volcano crater, & he was rocked into Manhood by the throes of an earthquake. The storm beat in thundering fury about his whole life. Clearly a ray of sunshine struck upon any part of the pathway of his earthly pilgrimage.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42289,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/42289","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b79d90413e31b93411a872d0905b87c1.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b79d90413e31b93411a872d0905b87c1.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b79d90413e31b93411a872d0905b87c1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b79d90413e31b93411a872d0905b87c1.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T13:03:46+00:00","modified":"2020-04-22T21:35:14+00:00","filename":"b79d90413e31b93411a872d0905b87c1.jpg","authentication":"db9cbde48af466a8ddd2e8bc387f4149","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_075_006_004_o2.jpg","size":1746208,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2842,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.056891599551698000813981792589402175508439540863037109375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170803"],"TimeCreated":["010201"],"Credit":["134252"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170803"],"TimeCreated":["010201"],"Credit":["134252"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170803"],"TimeCreated":["010201"],"Credit":["134252"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b79d90413e31b93411a872d0905b87c1.jpg","FileDateTime":1509454885,"FileSize":1746208,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2842\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2842,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:04 11:17:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333332999803833018859222647733986377716064453125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:03 01:02:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:03 01:02:01","ShutterSpeedValue":4.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3229,"ExifImageLength":4089,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":183,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/183","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Now in what respect has my life been like Christ's, in no one.

I supposed she had intended to, & thought she had; but had failed to do so; I was about writing her to this effect, had actually commenced the sentence; when the thought struck me, that to convince her I would read it again very carefully. I got it, opened it, & as I opened it, several sheets, the page on which my eyes rested first was all new, & startled me as though Sarah herself has appeared before me in severe reproof. Now is that believable? So confident was I that I would have taken my oath in God's living & visible presence, that Sarah had written no such thing to me that came to my hand. All was on that page touching the matter between us, save the closing sentence. That sentence I misread as I have told you before. The truth was, I convinced reading that letter half in despair, as I ran over page after page every hope vanished & accidentally missing next to the last page & finding it close as I thought, id did, I threw it down in the most perfect wretchedness. I thought the closing paragraph, contrived a contradiction in itself. I studied upon it long & often, to reconcile it, but concluded at length that the last sentence was expressive of my fate. I ran over it hastily the words of the letter several times. but always made the same blunder I can scarcely help believing that there was something providential in it. This alone reconciles me to it.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42296,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/42296","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/755b238ee20800f364ecbf5df9c2dfa9.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/755b238ee20800f364ecbf5df9c2dfa9.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/755b238ee20800f364ecbf5df9c2dfa9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/755b238ee20800f364ecbf5df9c2dfa9.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T13:04:06+00:00","modified":"2020-04-23T02:43:51+00:00","filename":"755b238ee20800f364ecbf5df9c2dfa9.jpg","authentication":"2ad44a7da295648a28ba9968b0f2c5ca","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_075_008_003_o2.jpg","size":1561301,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2883,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05014391516039100327173372306788223795592784881591796875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170803"],"TimeCreated":["010326"],"Credit":["134252"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170803"],"TimeCreated":["010326"],"Credit":["134252"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170803"],"TimeCreated":["010326"],"Credit":["134252"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"755b238ee20800f364ecbf5df9c2dfa9.jpg","FileDateTime":1509454886,"FileSize":1561301,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2883\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2883,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:04 11:18:12","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333332999803833018859222647733986377716064453125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:03 01:03:26","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:03 01:03:26","ShutterSpeedValue":4.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3286,"ExifImageLength":4102,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":183,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/183","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"It seems to me that I have been impelled by an unseen hand through all my intercourse with Sarah, & in my movements with respect to my labors.

How strange! Strange to me! I love my sisters well, dearly, strongly. But no event in their like could make me so happy as their marriage with my full approval. Perhaps you do not estimate marriage as I do. But you will by & by. How glad I am of your arrangements with Josephine. My heart leaped for joy when you told me. She is a sweet, choice, noble spirit, with a heart as strong in love as any one in my acquaintance. Perhaps I know her better than you. Her affections are the most powerful elements of her character. I know of nobody that can love harder than Josephine, or that has a sweeter, purer, & holier soul. Next to Sarah, stands Josephine, in my esteem & admiration of living women. You do not know her worth yet. The loveliest hints of her beauty of soul are unrevealed. I dreamed not of them till I examined her mental constitution. She will not reveal them ever to you, till she does it in the sacred sanctuary of marriage. Mark, my words! You have not yet the charm & blessedness which come from her beauty of soul. It will bear you up in its own elysium of blessedness by & by. But see here! In two terms you will be able to know what your school will be. If you are prepared, may you not then be married with Sarah & I. We will all be married at once, if it may be. Somebody else shall marry Sarah & I, & then I will marry you & Josephine, then we will kneel around one common altar & ask God to bless us according to his gracious goodness. Then what you fancy you will loose from Sarah you will more than make up from Josephine. Think of it. But you will loose nothing from Sarah. You place will not be disturbed in her heart by another; occupying another place. She will love you all the better.\nI shall send a letter tomorrow to Sarah, which I have partly written, in which I have given her a brief history of my feelings since she left Marietta. If she is willing you may read it. Sarah wrote me a doleful letter about her health. It frightened me almost out of my wits. She now says she is well. I said so much against her going to Marietta chiefly on her account, I thought she would be happier & healthier with me. I believe few prize health as I do.

He was slovenly, you are neat. He was \"pell-well\", \"helterskelter'; you are orderly. He was hasty & inconsiderate; you are prudent & thoughtful. He was harsh, rough, & often horribly uncouth in his expressions to his school; you are chaste, correct, & elegant in your words of expression. He is no financier; they expect you are one. In all that particulars the people expect you will make up for his faults. You know Bro. Raymonds faults; & all the people there know them just as well as you or I do.& he has tried some of them beyond reason. Still he is a strong & efficient teacher. They know it. They do not expect anybody to surpass him in some respects. I think they have the fullest confidence in you. I think then- will he just as many scholars as if Raymond staid & perhaps some more. His imprudence actually drew away many scholars. Some of them may come back now. \nI was intending to write to the store as you suggest as the subject.

I believe if you had spent the whole year at work on a farm it would have done you much good. You speak of the strange circumstances, or power that seem to have controlled you & Sarah. I have thought much on the subject. When I went to M. I went all against my own desires. A little talk had been needed by Br. Eaton about a school. I entered into it heart & soul, & have got things under way.  I then wrote to Raymond, & induced him to go there. We got the school fairly under way, when you & Sarah visited us. You know the rest. I was thinking awhile ago, how strangely I have been instrumental in effecting the destiny of your family. I introduced Raymond to our denomination in the West, & was probably chiefly instrumental in bringing him into the Ministry. He now occupies as fair a position as any young man now In our Ministry for usefulness & honor. You know the changes in your life & Sarah that it has effected or is likely to. The effect upon Jesse & Myron & Lydia is yet in embryo. But your changes & Sarah's will be very likely to affect them materially.

And you are in good old Marietta. Oh that I could spend a week with you there: you & Josie, Sarah & I! Could we not have some good walks? Every street has a memory for me.

I sat idolatry, for it is nothing more nor less than that. I am a worshiper, not of the false, but of the truly beautiful & good.

My being, then, dwells in love be it dead or alive, in the flesh or the spirit. That is my present position, locality & standing. I scarcely know whether I am in the flesh or out of it. I guess in the flesh though I think of all I shall yet know some of the joys of this life. If I know them at all I shall know them in their briming & bewitching fullness.

They have burned out much dross. I am every day entering into new fields of thought, & making new discoveries in old ones. Our general views are right & the world will some day see it. The Soul is progressive & immortal, entering the next life as it leaves this. That life is superior to this, grander, happier, fuller, but analigous to this in all that pertains to the souls progress & happiness. Crowns must be wrought out there as well as here. Reward is the price of labor anywhere. The soul must work out its destiny as well as fortune. It is free, ground in its powers, and glorious in its destiny. All things are under God doing his will, either freely & voluntarily at once by obedience, or forcibly in the end through his penalties which look to a free obedience as their end. Punishment in the end compels voluntary obedience. All is free in earth & heaven & yet all subject to law, to rewards & penalties. To be good in this life is best for time & eternity. The best is heaven, the worst is hell. Heaven & hell are both competitive.  They relate to each other. What is my heaven would be an angel's hell and what is my hell would be a devil's heaven. You & I enjoy the rapt visions of Christ & Paul. Others enjoy only lower things. They stand on one of the steps that lead to the gardens of heaven. The earthly is first; the spiritual after,--the worm & then the butterfly--the man, the spirit & then the angel. God is above and all powerful in attraction. The universe is moving towards him. He loves me as well as an angel. for he knows I shall be an angel; He sees the end from the beginning\". He loves Judas as well as me for Judas shall be an angel. His love is universal & equal; but men & spirits receive it according to ability. The sun shines upon all plants alike, but all plants do not absorb his light alike. God is generous & impartial as the sun. All then will be saved; that is will absorb God's light & love. Christ is the Medium, the dispensary. The sick must come to him.\nDear brother, let us go on to perfection, growing wiser, more useful & happy. I wish I could tell you what is sometimes within you. My soul is often harmonious like a glow worm and my heart always warm like a true woman's. I hope for an intense & glorious happiness yet. God withholds it from me for a little only that I shall be prepared to enjoy it the better. He is good. My life of labor is the offering I will lay upon his altar: and my life of happiness will be his reward. I know he will make me happy & Sarah is his handmaiden to enjoy it with me.  Something good is in store for us & for you my dear brother. \"Labor & wait\"  Your school! How I long to hear that it is full. Oh, I am sorry the good old church at Marietta has no more to interest you. How much I have hoped that you & Sarah would find a congenial spirit in Br. B. How sorry I am. \"But one star differeth from another in glory.\" Dis? not one because it is not another. Be a sieve to catch the kernel, & let pass the chess & chaff. Some are of soul, & some of Apollos. I minister to one class, he to another, Raymond to another. One cannot minister to all.\nYour affectionate brother Geo.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42309,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/42309","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/1946767c0c24a9f64184766460828691.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/1946767c0c24a9f64184766460828691.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/1946767c0c24a9f64184766460828691.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1946767c0c24a9f64184766460828691.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T13:04:43+00:00","modified":"2020-04-23T06:02:02+00:00","filename":"1946767c0c24a9f64184766460828691.jpg","authentication":"7a223a787fc4817bf84cf1def3ca0038","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_076_001_001_o2.jpg","size":1431546,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2327,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05696199207372400208360119222561479546129703521728515625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170803"],"TimeCreated":["031528"],"Credit":["134252"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170803"],"TimeCreated":["031528"],"Credit":["134252"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170803"],"TimeCreated":["031528"],"Credit":["134252"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1946767c0c24a9f64184766460828691.jpg","FileDateTime":1509454886,"FileSize":1431546,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2327\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2327,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:04 11:18:50","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333332999803833018859222647733986377716064453125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:03 03:15:28","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:03 03:15:28","ShutterSpeedValue":4.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":44,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3219,"ExifImageLength":4978,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":183,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/183","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"St. Louis.

Still I am very weak, just creeping about; can't write or read or perform my labor.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42327,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/42327","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/914212ea958b564ed8f7e720ea9da9b5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/914212ea958b564ed8f7e720ea9da9b5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/914212ea958b564ed8f7e720ea9da9b5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/914212ea958b564ed8f7e720ea9da9b5.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T13:05:22+00:00","modified":"2020-04-23T05:14:00+00:00","filename":"914212ea958b564ed8f7e720ea9da9b5.jpg","authentication":"6209355f8e2b80fe75f030a3fd52be43","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_076_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1316050,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2268,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053728607355150996560677612023937399499118328094482421875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170803"],"TimeCreated":["031849"],"Credit":["134252"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170803"],"TimeCreated":["031849"],"Credit":["134252"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170803"],"TimeCreated":["031849"],"Credit":["134252"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"914212ea958b564ed8f7e720ea9da9b5.jpg","FileDateTime":1509454887,"FileSize":1316050,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2268\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2268,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:04 11:19:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333332999803833018859222647733986377716064453125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:03 03:18:49","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:03 03:18:49","ShutterSpeedValue":4.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":66,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3023,"ExifImageLength":4797,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":183,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/183","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I eat well, sleep tolerably well, feel well & am well; only I am \"powerful weak.\" Oh that women would learn to cook!

They have rented the old glass establishment near the Arsenal, in sight of my house, for ten years with the privilege of buying at that time at $15,000. Their rent is $1000, for three years, after that $1200, per year. They have ten acres of ground for three years; after that five acre, on which are five or six dwelling houses. The five acres with five dwellings is what they are to have for $15,000.\n\nThey have got a splendid bargain, according to my judgement. They want a partner to do the outside business, who can bring about $3,000 & take a third of the establishment. They are both practical glass makers & want to be all the time with their men. It looks to me like a clear road to a fortune. One of the men has been several years at Pittsburg. He says two thirds of the glass makers at Pittsburg comes to St. Louis.  I know a man at Wheeling who is about 15 years has made an immense fortune, at this business.\nThey are good appearing men, of our faith. What think you?Had you not better come & see them?

The business will be easy, the out-door business, buying, selling, traveling a little.  They are all ready to start - several houses in town want to give the large orders, which they will turn into money in a few days - after they start. They will do much work not done west of N.

May we who are left strive to emulate her virtues, and live as she lived so that we may hope to meet her in that happy land.\nIt is too late for me to mail this letter this morning but I will close and mail it so that it will go tomorrow.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":37067,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/37067","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/e165e71e0e195503235b3446852b0e51.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/e165e71e0e195503235b3446852b0e51.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/e165e71e0e195503235b3446852b0e51.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e165e71e0e195503235b3446852b0e51.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-17T15:21:55+00:00","modified":"2020-01-21T17:39:40+00:00","filename":"e165e71e0e195503235b3446852b0e51.jpg","authentication":"88176eb5e8410e9fcfceec876a78be25","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_12_fl_446_025_03_o2.jpg","size":995410,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2260,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040782120616191},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["yp"],"DateCreated":["20160802"],"TimeCreated":["050610+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["yp"],"DateCreated":["20160802"],"TimeCreated":["050610+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["yp"],"DateCreated":["20160802"],"TimeCreated":["050610+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e165e71e0e195503235b3446852b0e51.jpg","FileDateTime":1508253636,"FileSize":995410,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2260\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2260,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:04 10:24:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:08:02 05:06:10","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:08:02 05:06:10","ShutterSpeedValue":6.643856,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTime":9,"SubSecTimeOriginal":9,"SubSecTimeDigitized":9,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1793,"ExifImageLength":2855,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":160,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/160","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"without fail.

You wrote me a letter a long time ago, which I think I have answered. But whether you have written again, and have received no reply, or do not consider the old debt fully paid I cannot tell. Your letter to Eddie came last night, and your and Anna's letter to Pa and Ma was received Thursday. We are glad to hear that your hearing is no worse. Has Anna tried the oil of smoke yet, or have you not received it. I suppose you received that. Mother and Sarah had not finished their letters. Pa and Eddie fastened the envelope all up nice, supposing they had got through writing, but made a mistake. Sarah wants to know if Anna would like to have her furs. We think we can send they by mail for 5 shillings and Sarah says she can get along firstrate without them. Father and Sarah went to see Lizzie yesterday. Pa came back last night. We don't know when S will come. Lizzie is very weak two words underscored. When I was down the fore part of the week she was for 2 or 3 days without getting up at all, and when Mary took her up to make her bed, she almost fainted, but she appeared to feel better after she rested again. We are well. Have got lots of snow.

I don't know if I mentioned this, but several years ago I was supposed to have an operation on my left knee. The surgeon, Phil Lewin, was a specialist on the knee. Not many surgeons can claim great skill with the knee, I learned. The doc died before the operation was performed. He was married to the woman who provides the dancers, Merriel Abbott, for the Palmer House, etc. A man I worked with had the same operation by another surgeon, and it was a big failure- he had to retire, as the knee got worse afterward.\nI remain at this rooming house, not happy, but stuck until I do better.

On the gab programs (new to me), which you've probably heard, as you were in this area until fairly recently, it's interesting to see how people respond. Cops are all for it, so are the comfortable citizens, this experience, was always apprehensive, as cops in Chicago always feeling that they will be the principal targets of this measure, and perhaps they're right. \nHave you heard the PILL joke about the pregnant mother whose baby was born with one clenched fist? When opened, there was the pill inside the hand. \nFrom the time JFK's ambition to enter the White House was realized, I used to say (with Bobby playing such a prominent role and Ted being frequently mentioned) that the Kennedys were bent on establishing a dynasty (pron. \"din-asty\"in England ), giving JFL god-like qualities, totally false, moreover there was nothing in the Kennedy's past that showed the family more than normally disposed towards suffering humanity. It was funny after living in N. Ireland, realizing how in Sou. Ireland used to ask about this \"great man,\" and in Ulster people started off by saying that they didn't think Jackie was so beautiful (agreed), then seemed to want to hear how rotten old Joe and the others really were. So Gore Vidal has delivered himself of the same kind of sentiments I had, only in his case he had more evidence, having a distant sort of relationship with that bunch through Jackie and he being some sort that JFK was elected by a tiny majority, practically all of which was through vote fraud, The So. Irish didn't care, which was always the way with the people everywhere - win at any price. You will recall how a judge from E. St. Louis was brought to Chicago after the 1960 election to whitewash each and every person who had stuffed ballot boxes, etc. \nHave often wondered if you manage to get the Chicago newspapers, especially those Sunday ones that are important to you. Anyways, here's a clipping on the Algren, et al, case.\nOur house in Maidstone has been on the block for a couple of months now. Slow in getting anybody with our price, which is what we paid in the first place (but we put 500 bucks into it). As I sometimes think (mainly to not having made the right connections here as yet) I should return, and as my wife might weary of it all, it would be a matter of personal reproach and Christ know how much from my kids and others; maybe I will, if only long enough to get rid of the joint and accompany her home by boat. I have to think about it a mite more. I don't regard the affair as a complete loss, the experience was most worthwhile, but you know some people moan when they lose a race. \nBest wishes to you and Mrs. Conroy, and I hoper her leg is improving.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":125806,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/125806","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/96fe6715744e7810112ed7cc67e5d5a2.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/96fe6715744e7810112ed7cc67e5d5a2.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/96fe6715744e7810112ed7cc67e5d5a2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/96fe6715744e7810112ed7cc67e5d5a2.jpg"},"added":"2023-01-06T22:04:03+00:00","modified":"2023-02-06T22:27:44+00:00","filename":"96fe6715744e7810112ed7cc67e5d5a2.jpg","authentication":"dfb97923e0bdaea23f63a2d0f72a6268","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_conroy_box_00019_fl_01026_000014.jpg","size":122341,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1200,"resolution_y":802,"compression_ratio":0.042373579939041283726197661962942220270633697509765625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 19], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 19], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 19], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1451,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1451","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"postcard\nGrand Circus Park\nDETROIT MICHIGAN\nLooking west toward the Statler Hotel, Tuller Hotel, Adams and Park Avenues.\nWed.

Recently, I finished re-reading The Disinherited, and I find it bring back to me things I knew about, yet let slip my mind. It brings back those days when I had so much health, so little money, hungry days around Toledo and Detroit, but hope abundant, yet my situation was then bordering on tragic, with two kids and a wife back in Chicago and the whole Depression ahead. And tire 110s put out by Hoover and Co., and the Republicans' thin promises today are just the same.\nAbout mid-August, a young Englishwoman, by name Sally Trench, who had a book to her credit concerning homeless men in London and had lost an eye by getting in the way of a drunk a bottle, was here doing some articles on Skid Row for the Chicago Daily News. Possibly she has religious motivation, certainly a kindly-disposed person toward the winos, dinos, etc., and either much courage or deliberate disregard for her own safety. I out-out the News articles and sent them overseas, don't know if you know anything about the woman.. I did hear her being interviewed on radio station WBBM here. I got the impression that she was deeply sincere, though not really understand- ing that quite a few homeless men want it that way..And Madison Street now is even more decadent and more dangerous than ever.. There are now a lot of gaps (something like the bombed-out areas in England after WW 2) where the Soul Brothers had fun with fires last April though certain vacant spots were made by the moving of John M. Smyth furniture store and the hotel that used to be across from the C&NW depot.. I frequently passed the corner of Madison & Halsted and I also used to work near there (on the Milw.RR near Fulton & Halsted), so I knew the district of old. Around Madison & Halsted is where the IWW used to have their hdqtrs, and published English, Finnish & Spanish edit- 1ons of their paper. I wrote to Miss Trench, whose publishers are Haddo & Stoughton, London. She replied with a certain graciousness, so I have sent her a paperback that was re-issued a few years ago, The Hobo, which was a rather thorough study by a man who got his doctorate from the Univ. of Chgo through this work, way back in the 1920's, and I also sent her your book, The Disinherited last Monday.\nI made the two-hour trip down to our last lodge meeting at 85th and Racine last Monday evening. Our delegate Just back from a month- long convention in Florida, proudly announced that the union had sent a telegram of congratulation to Yer Hare Daley in appreciation of his handling of the Democratic Convention. No surprise to me, much as I was simply disgusted, as the late president of the BRT always worked in the interest of the railroad companies. Members don't elect the leading officers of this union, the delegates do, every four years. This delegate is brother-in-law to Charlie Jiampa, the little Italian I brought over to help you move from Green Street. He in turn is bro- in-law to a city fireman who holds a minob official position in the Chicago Firemen's Union, and you know him. I lost my railroad job in 1928 when I ran against a stooge of the late union president, and the stooge (local chairman) and the president, then gen. chairman, conspired with the railroad company to fire me as an agitator, though an investigation on trumped-up charges of alleged rules violations was the means used. The members of that lodge were up in armw, knowing how crooked that local chairman was and dissatisfied with the general chairman over a long period. The union officials and the company kept me from ever going back to work, even though the union hdqtrs had reviewed the investigation transcript and found me blameless. So, I expect nothing much from the union, though this lodge I'm in has many men who are friendly to me. However, the Michigan Central men in this NYO lodge are outnumbered 20 to 1. The NYC-Penna Co. are now merged and the laughter of Jobs has begun. Where the NYC had 35 engines in yard service last year (3 swan to an engine), they now hav 18 engs.  I only belong to the union because of my insurance, and we had to belong under what is known as the union shop, akin to closed shop. After the Depression eased a bit for me (1936) and up to 1955, I refused to be a member of such a lousy outfit. The BRT has the worst reputation on the railroads anywhere, having broken down so many strikes in the past, and

only provided two obsolete (no air-conditioning), dirty\n\npassenger coaches on the Manhattan Limited, formerly a really good, though not an excess-fare, train. Running time was good, though arriving only 20 mins late, \"P.C\"\nhas a vicious plan to cut service, which is being fought by a passenger group and (perhaps too mildly) the R.R. unions. West of Harrisburg the \"rails\" aboard showed me where 44 cars had left the tracks. Many autos were in a river, fell off cars. I had only time for a few days in Dublin, three in all, and lost the better part of 24 hrs  due to quite heavy rain. You may have noticed a store on the right side of Talbot street as you approach the Amiens street railway station? This store sells fruit, candy, etc. also sweepstakes tickets, sells only those five-shilling shares (5\/).\nNot having a great deal of time, I bought several full, \u00a31, tickets - for my wife's sister and one for the little boy who lives in the land (Warner Ave.). Very few Irish have the \u00a31 tickets, buy shares: So, you don't have a lot of tickets, really, just four - 5\/= a full ticket, so hang onto the four and the top receipt. .\n\nIcelandic airline had (for me) the most economical fare, and with my pass I rode to New York to board, as the line doesn't fly from Chicago.

We kept flying around for 40 mins above the field, finally made a rough landing, but luckily no one was killed, no fire broke out, but there were the fire dept and six police wagons, presumably for make-shift ambulances. There was some wailing went on and delayed action hysteria amongst the women, but other than falling over a baby carriage thrown in my way at the emergency door, causing some soreness on one side, I'm probably OK.

While we were in Dublin, men were insisting on living with their families, at least on week-ends, and troops had to be called out to prevent the husbands from taking over the hostels.  The families concerned had had to leave the houses that were being \"pulled down,\" to use the old country phrase.  It's little wonder that we (my wife and I) could  find nothing decent in underlined: our price range,  though we were offered flatlets (6) that weren't fit to store nice coal in, at exorbitant rentals.  Flats such as we lived in on Sangamon Street in Chicago are called \"luxury flats,\" and to get into \"a block of luxury flats\" one must get on a long waiting list, wait from six months to a year, then pay a thing called \"rates,\" which is part of the landlords' taxes, also make a substantial deposit to guarantee decoration of the flat after one departs,  and not to forget, sign a lease for maybe two or three years.  This latter thing was also a feature of engaging the cheaper, old-style places.  I suspect that the English financiers (estate agents handle matters for them) are still running the money business in Ireland.  There were more flats available in N. Ireland, but the same high prices and almost as dirty, though not so much pressure about signing long term leases.  One could smell the religious intolerance in Belfast, and my wife, who was a sincere Methodist, told me she felt one could never really \"belong\" up there; none of the friendliness a stranger meets with in the USA when he comes to a new church.\n\n   Beginning with Birmingham on my way down toward southern England, I noticed that the \"C of E\" churches had on their announcement boards the phrase, \"Ignore the hungry, maybe they'll go away.\"  Which is what even the churches have always done, and now, all of a sudden a great interest in the hungry - coupled woth sic a money drive.  But I must say that I think the Episcopalian Church has a much better record as to treatment of the poor, and I may have told you that my mother and the kids of our family were once \"guests\" at the Home for the Friendless, note in left margin:  51st & Vincennes  which later became Oakwoods Relief station, and more recently a tumble-down public school.   The \"home\" was \"C of E,\"  but I remember there was more kindness than at a Catholic orphanage where I spent some time, long enough to get a skin infection when a nun had three of us boys bathe in a wooden tub with no change of water.  I was boy number three, the others had obvious ringworm on their heads.  We were treated more like prisoners there, beatings were handed out like handbills, and the food was ghastly.  It's been great to realize the the R. C. Church has been foiled in its latest attempt to raid the state treasury, and I even thank the Baptist fanatics who came to Springfield in great numbers to beat the bill to grant aid to the Catholic school system.  I've been contributing to Madalyn Murray's    \"S-O-S\" outfit for years.  Joined A.C.L.U. last year.\n  Quite cool weather today.  I've turned on my gas heater three times since May 1, and will do so again tonight, I reckon.  We 'uns that retired from RR service are supposed to get an increase in pensions one of these days, we hope.

After having lived in Iowa, the section mentioned in Terkel's book, Hard Times, a couple of years, our family returned to Chicago and lived on the north side for many years.  In 1941 I returned to West Englewood and lived at 6010 So. Union (almost straight through from your old place on Green), and as I often times walked to the Englewood (NYC-CRI&P) station, I used to look at the few remaining tiles, all that was then left of the old Glamour, and in 1941 a vacant lot supporting only a large billboard.  Up along Wentworth Avenue to the north I can even now show anyone where various old movie houses used to be and some of those really 3rd. rate vaude houses that never charge more than 25\u20b5. and most people paid only 15\u20b5.  kids a nickel.  We had lived in my early childhood in that section around 71st and Stoney Island Ave. known as Parkside, and can recall the old Parkside Theater, where I saw The Perils of Kathleen, Perils of Pauline, and in particular the story, name of which co-incides with a famous law concerning missing persons - The Enoch Arden Story, which (I think) concerned a sailor who disappeared for seven years and re-appeared after his wife had remarried.   Even then the pathos touched me and I have never forgotten the name of the film, though most of the action is forgotten.\n\n  I read Shadow of My Brother not long ago.  Davis Grubb certainly is a hardworking guy.  I saw the film of Night of the Hunter, one of his other books, a few years ago.   But as in the book by Alexander Saxton - Bright Web in the Darkness, I can see very poor sales, as too few negroes would buy the book, sympathetic as it is to negroes, and practically none but a few whites can witness or think about integration without becoming ill.  . I tried to 'phone Saxton while in northern California in 1968, did in fact go to Sausalito when I couldn't find him in the 'phone book, amde [sic] an awful climb and went to his house (the town is almost all hills where houses cling to the earth), but he wasn't home.  The Saxton book I mentioned is in the Seven Seas group on Charing Cross Rd., London.\n  A letter from a granddaughter who is helping her husband through university tells me that the FBI and local police look in on classes such as the study of Strategy of the People's Army.  She lives in Santa Ana, Orange County, California, a town where the cops are in the Birch Society in big numbers.   Her husband also took classes in the study of Marxism and Leninism, getting \"A\" in all studies.  And I wouldn't be surprised if the FBI and cops had an interest in the latter studies.   A few nights ago I saw a rerun of the Army-McCarthy hearings, and as I look at him, S. Agnew seems to be trying to take Joe McCarthy's place, but he is certainly firing the ammunition prepared by Sneaky Dick.  Nixon always has made me think of someone wanted by the police - when I see him.  In the book re the Hollywood Ten, I noted that Nixon never tried to see that the accused got a fair hearing, allowed much irrelevant testimony by ignorant cats like Adolphe Menjou to be heard.   Wasn't it great when one of the ten met J. Parnell Thomas in the can later on?  Ring Lardner, jr. [sic] mentioned meeting that R.

I will be sending some of the clippings to my son, who lives in a county of southern California whose police are knee-deep in Birchism - Orange County - where Truman Capote spent a cuppla days in the crate for not revealing his source of information.\n I trust that you and your family are reasonably well, as I am, and was sorry to hear about the death of the ex-railroader relative of your wife.  In my childhood I used to be with old country Irish relatives a fair amount, and I recall their references to the good death - wherein a person doesn't suffer for long, just dies in his\/her sleep or is taken suddenly in a heart attack.  Jack Sheridan died suddenly, though his symptoms (high blood pressure for one)  pointed to death at least five years beforehand, as I saw it.  I spoke of this as one  of the non-religious speakers at his funeral.  A Polish-American attendant at the funeral home asked me why no preacher was present.  I told him that this was an aggregation of freethinkers, but there wasn't a bomb in the crowd.\n Though I never write on books (having a feeling of worship for them), I couldn't resist making a notation re. the Clancy Sigal review in the Listener, a review no doubt prompted by Terkel.  Sigal referred to Amos & Andy as having been negro-baiting, I believe.  I can well remember how even negroes enjoyed those radio and later television programs, though the latter weren't up to the radio ones.   Amos & Andy had been known as Sam 'n Henry up to their departure from radio station W-G-N in 1928.  I remember going to see them at the Senate Theater, note in right margin: 1924 a really nice movie palace, located at Madison & Kedzie, where they appeared in person.   Far too much sensitivity is responsible for the feeling that some Jews and some Negroes express when white men, I mean non-Jews, even mention Jews or Negroes in jokes or where any of the two races appear as villains, as Groucho Marx said some years ago.   More lately, Italians and Poles (they've been telling jokes on one another) have been getting aroused when jokes are told about them.  One of the worst examples of Jewish sensitivity was when Jews picketed the Oliver Twist film about fifteen years ago - because Dickens' Fagin was a Jew.  I have met Jews who never read a line of Dickens but who are sure Dickens was anti-semitic.  When I ask them how Bill Sikes struck them, they usually wind-up admitting they hadn't read Oliver Twist.   I have seen three versions of the film over some fifty years and enjoyed all of them.  While living in Maidstone, I saw Clancy Sigal one Sunday on TV with a panel   of critics who used to appear on a regular program.  I can't say this about Sigal, but the regular panel was a pack of snobs (England is plentifully supplied with 'em) who could always manage to find fault with every book and every play, demanding perfection all the way.   Which made me think, what did you ever write or create, you bastards?\n written note in left margin:  Best grape fruit came from Israel - \"Haifa\" or \"Jaffa\"  \n  Ever since your previous letter and clippings I've been intending to write again to say that my letter of acknowledgement at that time was inadequate, inasmuch as you raised the question about English pubs due to a clipping which stated that a National Catering Inquiry, representing brewers and caterers had criticized some pubs.  Undoubtedly the criticism was warranted, as it related to pre-prepared food, which meant sandwiches that dried out from standing too long; lack of attention to hygiene and cleanliness.  But one important thing is true:  nowhere in the British Isles are there any dives, that is, places where customers don't feel safe, where rowdies are allowed to hang around, with floozies on the make congregate openly.  Brewers themselves own practically all pubs, and to become a tenant and manage a pub one has to undergo close scrutiny, and unless known from previous experience in managing a bar, must have a wife to help run the joint.   Some pubs are unsatisfactory and messy, but these are the exception.  And there was a clipping concerning the international aspects of fruits and vegetables, which I recognized as a cooked-up item by the Irish-American who wrote it, based on the fact that England gets its produce from many sources - So. Africa, Australia, Spain, Poland, Cyprus, W. Indies, Israel, Italy, many other countries.  I noticed that the only prunes on sale were Santa Clara (San Jose) and sold several cents cheaper than in the USA.  Many years ago you could see the Breton Boys wearing rings of onions like Hawaaian [sic] leis, walking around the streets peddling.  This seems to have stopped around WW2.  As you probably noticed, a green-grocer is usually a florist as well.  And then there was the clipping concerning the farm in Cornwall which took in tourists to board.

And the clipping re. Eric Hoffer, is a case in point of a half-educated, self-educated man who very likely acquired a goodly bunch of pelf and decided he was not an ultra-conservative.  I have known so many who when they got a bunch of dough, forgot their former fellow-workers insofar as associating with them.  In the case of Hoffer, I'm sure Eric Sevareid was terribly embarrassed, as I'm sure Eric was his sponsor in the first instance.  I saw Hoffer on TV the time he made the asinine statement that led to his non-appearances and the loss of his column (herabouts [sic], anyway).\n\n  Carleton College, I have always thought, was rather a superior college as regards the minor colleges of this country, and it seems to me I've heard their prez say how they don't allow no banjo swingin' up there - keep a tight rein.  But you probably know that students in rural areas are usually plenty conservative themselves, are suspicious of city folk and have no truck with \"different\" ideas.  Not long ago I heard Mel Belli, one of America's leading trial lawyers, say that he was disappointed with a 350,000 dollar verdict from a Montana jury.  He further said that if the case had been brought in any large city the amount would have been twice as much.  Belli is plenty flamboyant, but probably gets the largest amounts for his clients, and other trial lawyers have been imitating his methods.   I have found farmers and westerners to be amongst the world's cheapest bastards, consequently, when I see a man with a ten-gallon hat, I am repulsed, my experiences on the tramp being revived.  Living in an Iowa farming community for two years, I was particularly amused in reading Ilka Chase's book, underlined:  Past Imperfect,  her account of a cowboy she met at some social affair in Long Island many years ago.  This farmer on horseback asked Ilka what she did for a living.   She said she wrote books.  \"Oh,\" said the cowboy, \"I read a book underlined: once.\"  I sometimes gave weary travelers a sandwich, sometimes a meal, and perhaps a quarter, when I was a kid helping the station agent in that Iowa town.  The farmers, who spent a lot of time in winter loafing at the station, used to tell me I was crazy.  A few years ago, a man who was living in Red wing [sic], Minnesota, told me of a farmer who came to town and wanted to sell a pair of women's high-button shoes!  Around harvest time the farmers would come to the station and meet the morning local freight, which usually had some passengers riding atop box cars.  The farmers would sometimes hire a field hand, but when the field hand wanted five dollars a day for pitching bundles, the farmers would get real mad, whereupon the field hand would climb aboard the train and depart.  The IWW were especially hated by farmers, as they demanded six dollars a day, with the farmers literally rolling in dough.   I earned 35 bucks a month for a long day, increased to 70 after one year - due to the McAdoo influence in USRR Admin., and the railroads hated to give those raises.\n   I re-read Huckleberry Finn recently, and I note that V.S. Pritchett, the outstanding English author, has praised the book not long ago, saying that the book gave a deep insight to humanity, that the humor was for all time.  I remember asking a station agent once (I was 14 at the time) if he'd ever read Huckleberry Finn.  Scornfully, he said:  \"Yeah, but I was a boy then, now I'M a man.\"  As much as to say he wouldn't be caught dead with the book now.\n   Your review of the Golden book was in last night's Panorama, which I've mailed earlier today, as the one and only post pick-up is 1:30 P.M., and Saturdays it's 12:30 P.M.  I also heard from Wedlake by card from California.  K&B now has an armed guard on main floor every day: I noticed a few weeks ago when I went downtown to order a book on the Sioux Indians, which is going  to the landlady at the York guest house where I stopped a few days last April.  Her late husband, a Sioux in the American army, was killed at Casablanca in WW-2.  As I may have told you previously, she was one of those people easy to talk with and not a bitchy, complaining, tyrant-type such as one meets so often, and I met two such on that trip.  One (Birmingham) thought it queer that a guest would want her to have breakfast at 8:00 A.M. (I didn't ask for this).  Another (Cambridge) complained that I woke her up by using the bathroom at 7:15 A.M.  handwritten note in left margin:  I also told the German that antiquated plumbing woke her, not I.  I was in pain from a gum condition at the time and had to use the bathroom anyway.  I later sent her a note reminding her that I hadn't eaten breakfast (was too disgusted) that morning, nor had I got my key money back (deposit), but she could probably use the money saved by purchasing some toilet paper, as there was only one thin sheet on hand that morning.   This latter landlady was a German, apparently somewhat better educated than most hausfraus.

Nice today).\nDear Jack:\n\n    Thanks for your letter of June 4 and for the clippings.  I note the one clipping comes from Joe Diggles, whom I have for quite some time now considered to be trifling.  I don't think he can see humanity in other than R. C. hierarchy views.  I suppose his return to the fold - if indeed he ever left it - came with the death of his mother, a woman who had connections enabling Joe to get a job with Catholic Charities.  In a burst of enthusiasm about three years ago when I heard that Cathy Come Home (BBC-tv), the film that shocked England by exposing the treatment of homeless families, was about to be shown on W-T-T-W, channel 11 here, I 'phoned Joe.  He asked me why I thought he'd be interested in that sort of subject.  I replied that I thought he might still believe in more humane treatment of decent but unfortunate people, and particularly, the Irish had been suffering from the same conditions, notably at Dublin, where in 1966 troops had to be called out when married men insisted upon staying over the week-end at \"hostels\" where their wives and children were housed after tenements were \"pulled down.\"\n\nhandwritten note in left margin:  \"Estate agents\" and land speculators are really responsible for the lack of housing just as here - them & the politicians\nMentioning that the Irish were also suffering from homelessness in England seemed to mellow him, but I was utterly disgusted, and I never suggested that he part with any money, though I had already forwarded forty dollars to the group known as SHELTER, which has varied elements (even a Catholic bishop) - churches of several faiths, many university students and faculty.  Oh, I once talked over the 'phone with Connolly's daughter here.\n\n   Your question re the Traven review is doubtless answered by the receipt of the two review sections I forwarded to you last Sunday, and your review appeared last Saturday in PANORAMA.  You probably know that Joe Haas died as a result of overexertion in a swimming pool while accompanied with Norman Mark, television critic for the Chicago Daily News.  Haas succeeded Bradley as head of the paper's book review section.   So, the dept. is probably in a state of flux.\n  Have you seen Des' O'Connor on Kraft Music Hall, and have you seen Val Doonican?  O'Connor is capable enough, but perhaps over-cute.  Doonican is a charming Irishman who doesn't give us too much showmanship, but satisfies and doesn't overtire us with those wornout, overworked tunes;  sings well and has a pleasant manner.  Doonican came on for the first time last Saturday.  We used to see O'Connor and Doonican on their own shows and always enjoyed them, as they are certainly different from the stereotyped stuff we have to watch here - like Dean Martin, for example, who has for years been using the old Joe E. Lewis pseudo-drunk routines.  THE JOKER IS WILD, Lewis' book written quite a few years ago was interesting to anyone familiar with Chicago at the time Lewis had his throat slashed by syndicate thugs.  For summertime entertainment when the big shows were closed, many went to the Green Mill Gardens for outstanding shows.  As in the case of Fred Allen, Lewis' material was often stolen by M-O-T, though he was himself of Jewish origin.  I only saw him once or twice briefly on the Ed Sullivan show.   His material was considered much too risque for the general public, as you may know.   As I mentioned to you sometime last year, S. J. Perelman appeared on the Dick Cavett show and stated then his intention to depart for England, that he was tired of America, that England was so civilized.  Certainly he wouldn't want to take on employment there even if offered, as pay is meager, and he's used to lots of moola.\n  I last saw Jimmy Sheridan about six months ago, by which time I was getting pretty tired (confidentially) of going to that hotel of his, where lately I always had to hear what a couple of other residents had to say and to listen to their questions.  These guys would simply walk into Jimmy's room without invitation.  Tiresome asses, both of them.  One of the men has since died, the other, a self-centered, middle-aged Jew, has attached himself to Jimmy almost night and day, though he doesn't live at Jimmy's place.  Jimmy called me a couple of weeks ago, and we talked at some length.  He says his legs give out after short exertion.  A couple of times I took him out to eat, using a taxi to go to the restaurant.  Jimmy seemed cheerful enough, though I think his operation was for cancer of the prostate gland.

The \"media\" used to tell us about HST's friendship with Herbie Hoover, as though it was really a fine thing.   Both were bastards, we know, who did everything to undermine democracy and were aided in that by the go-between man of at least two wars - Barney Baruch.\n   In one of his letters to me recently, Dave Tullman asked me if I could find out anything about a man named Targ, who appears to have had some connection with the book world.   This isn't the first mission he's given me, so I go about this rather calmly, but if you can recall any such person, let me know, and for Christ's sake, don't rush about it.  A few of the Jews (he appears to be only interested in M-O-T) (Members of Tribe) I did get in touch with by 'phone were certainly lacking in manners.  When I told one woman this, she said she didn't need to be civil to me, as she didn't know me!  I had inquired for Tullman about a man to whom she was related.   A steward in the 1st class section of the liner United States told me that he always layed-off when the liner went on cruises to the Carribean [sic] in winter, as those cruises had too many insulting Jews aboard, and no matter what they tipped, he'd rather do without the money.   When I got in touch with Rube Menken, he suggested we meet \"sometime\" and we'd have a coffee together.  Imagine, a whole coffee.  I told Dave later about his buddy, but Dave made allowances, saying maybe Rube was busy.  The aforementioned steward, an Englishman long resident in America, showed me Salvador Dali's spacious suite (paid for by the good old Yankee taxpayer - so-called \"good Will\" trip via our state dept), and when the boat docked, Dali sat on a bench alongside me and engaged in conversation with some other fascist P, while we awaited for our luggage to come off the vessel.  The steward told me that the ship was the playground for various celebrities, many of whom traveled at our expense, one being Bob Hope, who usually carried along three other people, including a female who shared a room with Hope.   And this tiresome ass is worshipped by the Methodists as one of their big men; no doubt he contributes heavily.  Yes, Nixon keeps trying desperately to gain some big victory he can use to gain re-election.  When the So.

I told her that the embassy was America, that we don't write for appointments on such routine matters.  I told her I was going to see someone above her (a good old American ruse), so she finally got me the new passport, but I had to be sworn by an American embassy aide (a young Jewish-American lawyer).

I know I have one or two of World Publishing Co. books around somewhere, having had occasion to buy some foreign language dictionaries and some books out of a cheap edition of Mark Twain's works a long time ago.   Thanks for the information.  Every now and then Tullman wants to get in touch with someone he knew.  They usually don't respond, and I'd bet a lot that that cheap S. O. B. Rube Menken is one of those.  As I mentioned in a previous letter, I once reached him by 'phone (another request by Tullman), during the course of which conversation he offered to \"meet me sometime\" and he'd buy a coffee.  Imagine, a whole coffee.\n  I've been disappointed in both the Des' O'Connor and the Val Doonican shows the past few times, as they've been featuring the stereotyped, short on talent people such as the American comedienne on last Wednesday's Kraft Show (I can't recall her name just now, but a proteg\u00e9e of Paar)  handwritten insert in left margin:  (Phyllis Diller, A Tiresome. Unnchanging routine).  and Leslie Uggams last Saturday night.  England has an abundance of big talent that we seldom or never see.  But of course, I suppose Doonican and O'Connor have little to say about these programs, as it's apparently American money backing the shows under ATV-TV sponsorship (the independent Lou Grade TV organization) and maybe American producers, who, no matter who gets his\/her own program, manage to have a lot of chorus people jumping up and down and dancing (?) in the same, tired old way.  Filling-in the time, I suppose.  I well remember a few of the shows (all-British) I've seen over there, especially at Brighton, the try-out town for London.  Uproarious comedy, fine singers and dancers, all doing original things.  In the summer of 1924, while my wife and I were on our honeymoon, we saw a musical-comedy group at Maidstone, first time I ever saw the comedy sketch wherein one comic tries to pull a tablecloth off a table without moving the dishes, etc. after his \"mate\" has already done so successfully.  The sketch was called \"Bed & Breakfast,\" with two down-at-the-heels roustabouts and a shrewish landlady.  In this show there was a gypsy caravan scene wherein a woman singer with a splendid voice sang Where My Caravan Has Rested, a song written by a Kent song writer who made many songs and was probably never known over here, which is due to the kind of people who have dominated the music world, screwed-up the movies and radio, \n\nOVER","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":125861,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/125861","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8f1d0cc895d9ad4e42ec26ed35a93565.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8f1d0cc895d9ad4e42ec26ed35a93565.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8f1d0cc895d9ad4e42ec26ed35a93565.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8f1d0cc895d9ad4e42ec26ed35a93565.jpg"},"added":"2023-01-06T22:04:20+00:00","modified":"2023-02-21T04:35:17+00:00","filename":"8f1d0cc895d9ad4e42ec26ed35a93565.jpg","authentication":"3a3772eb0b2f244c447134943521d16d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_conroy_box_00019_fl_01026_000129.jpg","size":180790,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":796,"resolution_y":1200,"compression_ratio":0.06308975432719150788773987414970179088413715362548828125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 19], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 19], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 19], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1451,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1451","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"AND have been busy doing the same with television ever since TV broadcasting has been with us, I mean since WW2.

He came from Rochdale, Lancashire, though the twins were born in Ballina, Co. Mayo., where their mother, a Ruane (well-known name in those parts), came from.

Jerry knew the Sheridans well, used to have a forum near the Marshall Field apts., where I went from time to time, and which you may have known - The Pindarians.  Another lawyer by the name of Sharp helped Jerry there, and I know that Jerry, who was ^FAR from being an all-out radical, used the joint to give a bit of experience to embryo lawyers, and, of course, law professors used to bring students to B.

And though Celia Healey was at our doings the other night, she escaped my knowledge at the time, however, I talked with her on the 'phone yesterday.  She asked about you.

It was at that time a machine shop, and the Cosmic Kid had to get out when the govt. found out he was an oldtime radical; the machine shop was doing some sort of govt. work then.  Caretaker, the English name for janitor, was a vocation the kid had followed a great part of his life.  He was so much more sophisticated than the average American radical, and because he usually stole the show at forums, was hated by some, especially some show-off Jewish types.  He had one Jewish foe who must have turned the kid in to the FBI a dozen times.

It's not just one of those flag-waving-things.  A busload of young people came and parked out in front of the theater that Saturday I attended the play, the passengers, from out of town, also attended.  Even the audience was great that day, only applauding at the proper intervals instead of 1.  The actors as they appeared. 2.  Every punch line or ringing statement, both of which crimes I trace to those awful radio\/tv studio \"warm-ups\" that have conditioned people who don't ordinarily attend the real theater.  But I'm probably too much theater-conscious after seeing plays for more that fifty years (when I had the price, which nowadays is just plain awful, yet are a heluva lot more justified than movie prices).  I never see movies at cinemas here anymore.  Imagine, former 25-cent joints charging 3 bucks & up!  \n\n   I've been re-reading GOOD-BYE TO ALL THAT, the book by Robt. Graves, which you gave me.  While living at Maidstone, the BBC-tv had a semi-documentary on WW-1 about the Somme, where so much incompetence on the part of generals was exposed, and where so many lives were lost needlessly.  BBC never hesitated to criticize govt. when it wanted to.  Mrs. Harris' brother (my wife was engaged to him) died in that awful long siege.  He'd been rejected early in the war because of a childhood injury, was gladly accepted in the latter part of the war as a stretcher bearer.  Was actually blown to pieces.  He that came from a large family that never knew any of even small luxuries, barely ate regularly.  I met his mother and father.  The mother was of a genteel family that came from Whitstable (famous for oysters).  She had to \"go into service,\" where she had the misfortune to meet the tall man Gates, who was a gardener on a rich man's estate, and married him thereby entering a lifetime of drudgery and poverty (but my thoughts on this - similar to my wife's - must remain confidential).  In            A VILLAGE GIRL, the authoress, who must have come from around Maidstone, doesn't dwell on the real horrors of \"going out to service,\" which was the fate of so many poor girls, which also contributed to the ranks of prostitutes, because of the conditions of such employment.   We've had parallels here in the mining areas - Woolworth Stores, the silk stocking industry for a few, that paid girls so little in past periods.  I'll be buying another copy to send away to England to a cousin of my wife,  who is another Village Girl.  I recently won 125 bucks in our union lottery, to which I pay 1.00 monthly.  The little Italian, Jiamp, who came briefly the day you moved from Green Street, won 1,000 dollars in that same drawing, he being only one number away from my number.  He's still working on the RR, a bro.-in-law of city fireman you know. \n\nRegards, Mead\nP.S.

June 10, '72\nDear Jack: \nThanks very much for CARNIVAL, which I've been reading (and in some chapters re- reading), and while I never regarded carnival workers and \"games\" as very lovely, the book was an eye-opener. On various railroads we handled carnival outfits - large and small, the Johnny Jones Expo being the largest of that trade. Older railroad men used to think it a good idea to steer clear of the roustabouts (called roughies in the book), as the older \"rails\" thought they were all lousebound. Outside of one fairly large outfit that came to Lears, Iowa (mentioned in HARD TIMES), about 30 mi. NE of Sioux City, I've never felt any desire to attend a carnival, not even the small street ones that frequently appear under the auspices of the \"R.C.\" Church and are plenty crooked, the games, that is. In the one in Iowa, there was a pit, where one locked down at a woman, who was alleged to show something if enough money was thrown down to her. I waited and waited but nothing happened. A Greek section hand beat the carnival wrestler but never got the prize, as the carnival referee found some technicality to deny the Greek the prize. I was once asked by u \"rail\" who was re-joining a carnival outfit if I was able to play a rube. He had a game where the patron (\"mar) could win prizes by knocking down pretty-well-stable black cats. Proposition was that I would carry off lotsa prized, egging on the real rubes. A brakeman I knew used to go down town to the State Street flophouse area and peddle all sorts of junk, using shills to promote buying. I think some English Jews brought the phoney auction idea to lower State Street and one or two other sleazy locations. I heard an English voice in front of one joint tell an associate (a Goy) to hang around and shill awhile. Of course, we also handled the big top circuses - Barnum & Bailey I recall handling at what used to be their home town- Bridgeport, Conn, this in 1926, before the outfit joined Ringling. My wife knew about the ticket-takers before she ever came to this country the short- changing aspect, that is. I used to see men being beaten, sometimes with small ball bats, at Calumet City, close to the Illinois-Indiana state line. These victims had objected to being short-changed at bars.

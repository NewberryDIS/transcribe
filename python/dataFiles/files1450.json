There were a lot of parties, one at Elaine Gottlieb's, where\n\nI saw Jane Mayhall and Harvey Shapiro. I called on Caro and Mitsu Yashima.\n\n I'm sending you a news clipping of an interview by Lee Grove of the Washington Post.\n   Affectionately,    Philippe\n\nI wish you could be here on the 30th. Eva sends her love.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":125710,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/125710","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/2ff8841e4e894f37728b1c3da8f8f8c3.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/2ff8841e4e894f37728b1c3da8f8f8c3.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/2ff8841e4e894f37728b1c3da8f8f8c3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2ff8841e4e894f37728b1c3da8f8f8c3.jpg"},"added":"2023-01-06T22:01:33+00:00","modified":"2023-03-11T22:09:18+00:00","filename":"2ff8841e4e894f37728b1c3da8f8f8c3.jpg","authentication":"aaa99d44b21205b7ced5a3acfda0de18","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_conroy_box_00019_fl_00995_000006.jpg","size":88714,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1200,"resolution_y":795,"compression_ratio":0.03099720475192173363421233034387114457786083221435546875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 19], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 19], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 19], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1450,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1450","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"All Good Wishes for the Holiday Season\nh\/w  to Jack and his family\n\n from Philo, Eva and Pierre Marcelin\n\nP.S.

I think hes [sic] a major ass-hole!  B- ]]\nCaption on photographs of two men's faces  Lows and highs of TABA Day:  From Irving [left], unforgivable boredom; from Houseman, fond memories of cooking oil.\nat foot of the page  Page 2 Section 7 CHICAGO TRIBUNE Book World May 15, 1983\nBEHIND THE COVER\nAmerican Book Awards:  Family ritual instead of star-spangled glory\nBy John Blades\nEditor of Book World\n\n If there's anything people in publishing love to hate, it's the American Book Awards.  TABA - as it's unaffectionately called - is their baby, but one they're always ready to disown and abandon.  Don't misunderstand:  Publishers are just as  happy as writers to win awards; it's the awards ceremony they have all come to dread so much.   This year's ceremony, held recently in New York, was fairly dreadful.  But, as always, it had its share of comic, even bizarre diversions; chief among them was the sight of novelist John \"Garp\" Irving changing from a literary lion into a goat before the audience's very eyes, like one of those monsters in a neo-horror-and-gore movie.\n  Irving's startling transmogrification was the only extravagant note in a comparatively austere, bare-boned ceremony.  After TABA deposed the venerable and respected National Book \n\nAwards four seasons ago - largely to give equal time and glory to the increasingly dominant paperback interests-there had been a mighty effort to turn the occasion into a weeklong bacchanal, with cocktail parties, receptions, luncheons, banquets and, as a climax to the revelry, an Oscarized presentation night, featuring such guest stars as Barbara Walters, Lauren Bacall and John Chancellor, the better to lend the ritual some sex and glamor, and, not incidentally, to bring out the TV cameras.\n\n  This year it seemed a lot less festive, with fewer parties and blessedly fewer awards [though the beast could only be tamed by chopping the ceremony into three parts - children's book awards in the morning, graphics in the afternoon and adult literature in the evening].  Whether this was due to the economically depressed state of publishing; the belated realization that literary prizes should be served with dignity and good taste, not glitz; or simply an indifference on the part of everyone but the winning authors, their spouses, publishers and publicists, I would hesitate to speculate.  Whatever the case, this year TABA Weeek was slenderized and streamlined into TABA Day; reluctantly or not, the principal sponsors, the Association of American Publishers, seeemed to have given up attempts to make it a star-spangled affair and settled for a family reunion, a spring gathering of the clan.  Instead of Bacall, Walters & Co., the winning authors were given their proper place in the spotlight; and, as master of ceremonies, a professional writer was enlisted - Brendan Gill of the New Yorker, who also happens to be a shamelessly histrionic speaker, one whose stunt-pilot grandiloquence soars, dives and takes an occasional outside loop.\n  That's not to say, however, that the sponsors totally abandoned their quest for air time or overlooked an opportunity to give the occasion the flavor of a TV game show.  To present the children's book awards, during the morning ceremony at Lincoln Center, they managed to corral Christopher \"Superman\" Reeve, who made a brief speech about the virtues of books and libraries that brought TABA a few precious minutes on the evening newscasts.  And by inviting Liz Smith to present the original paperback award, TABA was assured of a mention or two in her Daily News gossip columns.\n  The choice of the Public Library as the site for the awards in adult literature - over the years, TABA has become a traveling circus, moving from a regimental armory one year to Carnegie Hall the next - may have seemed especially fitting, but it came about only by accident; initially, publishers wanted to move the entire production to Dallas, for the annual meeting of American Booksellers, then discovered it was too late; the Public Library was a last-minute compromise because  it was convenient, available and affordable.  It did not prove to be ideal location, however.  A good many of the spectators were plainly ill at ease, seated at library tables in a vast [and un-air-conditioned] reading room, with sweatshop temperatures raising the discomfort index.\n   The setting did bring a number of the evening's best one-liners.  At the outset, emcee Gill noted that the warning signs around the room, \"Protect your valuables,\" were expressly placed there for publishers.  John Houseman, handing out awards in biography\/autobiography, recalled that he had once filmed a commercial for cooking oil in the room.  But the topper came from poet Richard Howard:   Receiving the prize for translation, he commented, \"This is the first time I've been in this room without a stranger putting a hand on my knee.\"  The steepness of the steps leading to the makeshift stage caused a number of small mishaps; after his glowing introduction as a distinguished historian and journalist, Harrison Salisbury stumbled on the way up to the rostrum, thereby earning the evening's \"most distinguished pratfall\" award.\n   Salisbury kept his dignity and the respect of his audience, however, which was more than could be said for John Irving, publishing's golden boy after his runaway success with \"Garp.\"  Irving was there not to receive but to give two awards in fiction - to Alice Walker for \"The Color Purple,\" the hardcover winner, and to Eudora Welty for the paperback edition of her collected stories.   Tossing away his ghostwritten introduction, loosening his tie, Irving assumed a defiant posture, as if daring anyone to eject him when his alloted [sic] three minutes  were up.   He spoke for 15 minutes [or more],  during which he disagreed with the choice of Walker for the award he was about to give her, saying Craig Nova's \"The Good Son\" was [italicized: his] candidate for the year's best novel; quoted Rilke, Dickens and Mann, among a multitude of others, as he lectured the audience on the responsibilities of writers; and told a long, self-aggrandizing anecdote about how he had once come gallantly to the aid of Eudora Welty.  The onlookers were clearly irritated and restless, but at least they didn't hiss and jeer, as they did last spring when the winner of a translation award - who had flown thousands of miles to receive it -  allowed his grateful remarks to run overtime.  Later, someone said of Irving:  \"We can forgive him for a lot of things.  We can forgive him for writing a lousy book like \"The Hotel New Hampshire.\"  We can forgive him for running out on his wife.  But we can't forgive him for boring us silly with a speech like that.\"\n   Yet the evening was not simply a collection of quips, slapstick and painfully extended monologues; it did have its sobering, graceful, even inspirational moments - notably with the acceptance speeches by Alice Walker [when Irving finally let her speak]; Gloria Naylor, receiving the first novel award for \"The Women of Brewster Place\";  Galway Kinnell, who was a winner for his \"Selected Poems\"' and Judith Thurman, who spoke of the eight years she'd devoted to her prize biography, \"Isak Dinesen.\"\n   That TABA had entered a new age of austerity seemed all the more evident when we moved from the awards ceremony to the reception, which was not [as in bygone good times] a regal buffet supper in a hotel ballroom but drinks, hors d'oeuvres and chamber music in the library's Astor Hall.  From what fragments of it I was able to pick up, the cocktail conversation touched on such matters as Irving's boorish performance, Truman Capote's health and the bloody dismissal of Vanity Fair editor Richard Locke after only three issues; but it mainly centered on the wobbly future of the American Book Awards.  About its future, only one thing can be said with any certainty [and I wouldn't make any bets on that]:  Next year they're taking the show on the road - to Washington, where the  awards will be dispersed at the booksellers convention.  And the year after that - who knows?  From all the discouraging words I heard about TABA, I wouldn't be surprised if the road leads to oblivion.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":125742,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/125742","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ec61e5ee56589c1d73f2f27488eae00b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ec61e5ee56589c1d73f2f27488eae00b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ec61e5ee56589c1d73f2f27488eae00b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ec61e5ee56589c1d73f2f27488eae00b.jpg"},"added":"2023-01-06T22:01:43+00:00","modified":"2023-03-16T03:55:34+00:00","filename":"ec61e5ee56589c1d73f2f27488eae00b.jpg","authentication":"eb23e0d05407fff238b10e61bda47d54","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_conroy_box_00019_fl_00999_000012.jpg","size":91254,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":925,"resolution_y":1200,"compression_ratio":0.027403603603603603200422611507747205905616283416748046875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 19], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 19], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 19], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1450,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1450","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"in pencil in top margin  [Markovitz]\nhandwritten note at top of page  Jack - thought this might interest you - Best as always Barbara\n\n   On Monday, January 13, 1969, two plain-clothes detectives arrived at Barbara's Bookstore, 1434 N.

Thanks for thinking of me.  You know, I had not only been thinking, but talking about you.  I was in West Berlin interviewing a woman (for my new book--a biography of Henry Miller) named Renate Gerhardt, the owner and editor of Gerhardt Verlag, and what appeared on the corner of her desk but a copy of underlined:  The Disinherited! So, inevitably, we talked  of the book, then of you, the little contact I had had with you, and again of the book.  Turned out she wants to publish it in Germany, and I told her I would send her your address--which I will do in a day or two.  (Hers is Renate Gerhardt, Gerhardt Verlag, 7, Jenaerstrasse, Berlin).  I suggested she might use your \"Home to Moberly\" autobiographical piece as an introduction (not Aaron), and so make a new edition.  So, you see, it was a real coincidence, since I had just been your agent abroad, to get your splendid article.  I've been interested in underlined:  The Anvil, but never knew much about it, and I am glad to do so now.\n\n  I still hope that we'll meet sometime.

True, Henry Kisor was a little \"gushy\" (\"when I wiped the tears from my eyes\"), but it was a good interview, particularly whenever it quoted underlined: you, and it was good to hear your  voice and to learn that except for that terrible diabetes, you are well and hearty.  I like the pictures too, along with your inked-in comments.\n  Underlined:  Writers in Revolt, of course, is a gem, you know, I looked at a couple of issues of Anvil when I was writing my West book,  but I didn't realize how many good pieces you managed to get, what a high standard you set in those 7 years, in those 3 magazines.  Most welcome of all is your good introduction, full of wit and sharp asservations.*   You have untangled a lot of things which otherwise would have been confusing  to future historians and literary scholars who will be studying the doings of the Sage of Moberly.\n Why didn't you include more than one of your own contributions to the magazines?  I looked for them first, and then, I went on to read the Algren and Hughes pieces and then read straight through.  Some of the folks I know or have met--Sonora Babb and Farrell and Mike gold--but some others were new discoveries for me--I'd never read a word by Kalar or Kissin or Leokum or some others.  And it was good to see new pieces by some writers whose other work I knew.\n   The next time I do any kind of course on the 30s, I'll certainly be using the book.  In the meantime I'll be recommending it to students, as I do \"The Disinherited,\" of course.\n  How comes the autobiography?

Dublin, sort of like Elmwood Park or Mont Clare, geographically, though not so far.\n\nOne sees Michael Collins' grave soon after entering. Brendan Behan's grave is remote in this very large cemetery. So remote only the cemetery\nofficials know its location. It is (purposely, I presume) unmarked.\n\n We have decided Dublin is not for us. This one month and fifteen days after landing at Cobh. People are nice, the country is beautiful, but \n\nrents are sky-high for lousy coal-holes, prices for old houses are equal to American prices and nothing like American conveniences.  And dirt!\nGenteel old landladies offer \"garden apartments\", really awful basements, for 50 to 60 bucks a month. Inflation is so bad the govt is taking steps,\nas the unions have to make more and more pay demands. So-called \"luxury apts\" are beyond our reach. Meat, espec. beef is as high or higher\nthan U.S. Beer, or ale (my drink) is 50% higher than in England. I must take care that my wife doesn't become ill, so what we saw in apts. is not fit.\nThe type of restaurants frequented by working people always has filthy floors - at lunch & dinner.

Include us in your itinerary if at all possible, and we'll have accomodation [sic], also you could go to Glasgow from\nLondon (either by air or RR), and cross to Belfast by steamer and afterwards to Dublin by train. On our last stay in Dublin we saw the ill-famed\nKilmainham Jail; just a short bus ride from College Green. We had previously seen Dublin Castle, which is free and a short walk from College green.\n\nRegards -  Mead","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":125787,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/125787","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/fdd128dde7a136a56a90ed8a5bfd3823.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/fdd128dde7a136a56a90ed8a5bfd3823.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/fdd128dde7a136a56a90ed8a5bfd3823.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fdd128dde7a136a56a90ed8a5bfd3823.jpg"},"added":"2023-01-06T22:01:57+00:00","modified":"2023-03-08T21:57:25+00:00","filename":"fdd128dde7a136a56a90ed8a5bfd3823.jpg","authentication":"614e5ecbb2551c9413a0e8410f46c2ad","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_conroy_box_00019_fl_01025_000070.jpg","size":124680,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1022,"resolution_y":1200,"compression_ratio":0.0338878016960208749974725606080028228461742401123046875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 19], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 19], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 19], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230105"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1450,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1450","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"envelope\nSender's name and address:\nF.

Ireland\nAug 21, 1965\n\nDear Jack:\n Raining hard today, has been all night with only a short stop of an hour or so. I'd say this is the coolest summer Mabel and I have\n\nknown since the summer of 1934. Not long ago I had my shoes repaired and had to listen to a considerable amount of advice from\nthe cobbler. I thought to take advantage of him, so asked how it is that when it rains, nobody seems to wear rubbers. \"Oh,\" he said,\n\"I've heard of them. You see, they never caught on here.\" Same in Sou. Ireland, resulting in damaged leather and discomfort, and no\ndoubt illness. Back to [[underlined: my]  shoes for the last time. Owing to the constant state of rivalry between N. Ireland and Eire, it's best to mail\nthe shoes from London, as up here we're the same as in the jolly old Empire. What's left of it. Would you register, or rather, insure\nthe package (just wrapped good in paper, no box).\n\n It seems the BBC has a Belfast outlet which actually does originate plays, etc., so I'll give the local station a try, maybe next week.\n\nMy wife's sister is visiting us this week, so we went out a little more than we might have done just now (business of \"settling-in,\" as\nthey say over here). The other day we visited a seaside place called Bangor, a really nice, clean resort, in contrast to Bray, outside of\nDublin. Bray is one of those tawdry, fish & chip, postcard shack seafronts. We were very disappointed with Bray, as with DunLaoghaire,\nthough the surrounding towns were pleasant enough, especially the Wicklow Hills near Bray. We are not far from the countryside here,\nand the vegetables have a fresh taste, so do the eggs. Oh, being a cross-channel town, we have two ships leaving every night. One for\nGlasgow, the other for Liverpool. All night trips, word covered by edge of paper one saves half and sees more. Trust you and your wife\nare well.    Mead\nP.S. If you'd like to see more of Eng., plus some of Scotland, investigate the sea-rail trip with Br.

The weather here we sometimes compare to California, though it can and does get colder here in winter, with a bit more rain the year 'round, which I don't mind as much as the natives.  I often used to tell people in Chicago that the weather changes, the winds, etc. were not simply a Chicago phenomenon.  Buffalo always gets more snow (source:  Adirondacks), and can be as cold as Chicago anytime.  I never saw so many weather changes so quickly as in No. Ireland.  The most-feared winds in these parts come form the northeast.  Crocuses have come to life in the tiny forecourt of our \"terrace house,\" but could be pushed down again soon, as winter is not yet over even in these parts, though Spring does come earlier.  The air here agrees with both my wife and I.   We think of Chicago as being quite dirty, yet dust quickly accumulates inside the house here, and there's not very much industry.\n  Conditions haven't permitted a trip to London, haven't been there since about Nov. 10, but will surely visit Collett's store as soon as I go again, which I hope to do early in March.  I would dearly have loved to live close to London, could not undertake it because of the opposition of my wife.  She really cares little for travel except under the most favorable circumstances, which probably goes for most women of middle-age or beyond.  I must take the blame for coming to Ireland, later England, and not finding things as we'd have wished.  I think my wife worries unduly, like the wife in Orwell's COMING UP FOR AIR, a book I lent to Jimmy Sheridan and which disappeared when he went back for his 2nd. (maybe final?) stay at the state hospital.   I send him a card now and then.  Had a copy of PANORAMA, the Chgo. News supplement, sent to me by Jack Sheridan.  The copy contained an article re. Studs Terkel, by Richard Christiansen, wherein Terkel complains about the folksinger, Bob Dylan, giving him the cold shoulder - and after all he done for him!  It has been amazing to see how the English young people have gone for the folksingers and the so-called \"pop\" artists.  People yo never heard of in the U.S. are big stuff here.  Absolutely celebrity nuts they are.  I was always sickened by the hero-worship in the U. S.  Believe me it's a fantastic thing over here.  People here are prepared to believe the most awful Barnum figures on the incomes of stars of all kinds.   There are numerous fan clubs for people like Frank Sinatra and even Humphrey Bogart-a-mouldering.\n    Amongst the two trunks of books I brought over here is MUCH ADO ABOUT ME, by Fred Allen.  Reading I WAS DANCING, I came to the name Toowoomba, which rang a bell, so I went up to the top floor of our joint to get the Allen book, found that Toowoomba is mentioned by Allen, as I'D thought, also that O'Conner had spent some months in Ireland with Allen & wife, and now I believe O'Connor must have helped Allen, who knows how much, in Allen's authoring.  I have read Allen's book several times, still get a kick out of certain incidents and phrases, and if you've never read it, be my guest.   I trust your recent re-publication is doing at least tolerably well and will do better.  A letter from the U. S. is like manna to me, or any publication, and I haven't seen a U. S. newspaper in full since we left there.  I enjoyed seeing some scenes from the recent hearings at Wash. D. C. on Viet Nam.  I notice the R. C. boss of the longshoremen is acting like a good member of Catholic Action toward the British carho [sic] ships that go to Viet Nam.  Saw some baskets from V-N in a store here the other day.  Our kitchen set turns out to be from Jogoslavia.[sic]  Bought eggs that came from Poland alos [sic] strawberry jam (\"Confiture de Fraises\") that was made in Rumania - in a super mart.  the other day.   Butter from N. Zealand is ubiquitous, also lamb from N.Z.  Very good grape fruit from Israel, So. Africa and Cyprus.  Lots of Spanish onions (and I try not to patronize things Spanish, a\/o Uno Y.)  Potatoes remain around 3\u00a2 lb., good ones, too.  A special kind of small potato, known as King Edward, sell for about 14\u00a2 lb.  Too special for me, as they come from the Canary Isles, another France domain.  Forgive typing.  Hate to put the typewriter in the shop.  Never know when it'll come back.  Ordered a suit.  Will be rushed to me in 3 weeks.  Usual time 5 to 6 weeks.  Thanks again for the O'Connor book, and will return it if it is really a loaner.  \n\nBest wishes F. Mead\nP.S.:  H.

For the first time in many years I saw Lionel Stander in a film.  Stander was here in person on a panel show with Robert Morley recently and I saw him then.  Raynond [sic] Walburn, the old guy who used to play con men, medicine men and grifters, was on the Lloyd picture also.  Walburn may still be alive (remember, he wore a mustache, was a sort of picaresque type - like W. C. Fields?), very likely in an actors' home.  Lou Gilbert told me one night at his house that in rehearsing for a play, he'd tried to help Walburn get his lines down, but the old guy just could not remember lines anymore.\n\n   It was really funny the other night watching the BBC interviewer with four British doctors.  The interviewr [sic] asked if there were any complaints bout the govt. increasing their salaries.  They demurred a bit, criticizing a little thing here, a little thing there, and then did what I knew they'd do all said they'd accept the raise, rise, which is around 2,800 bucks over two years.  This govt. suffers from the same ideas the Fabians did - they think that workingmen are too ignorant for administering a govt., and though I know this is to a great extent true, the men up from the ranks are far more knowledgeable about what makes industry tick.  Complaints have already been made by some Labour M.P's that old school ties are making too much headway in govt. through the election of educated M P's on Labour ticket.  Much anti-Viet Nam feeling, that is, anti U. S. -Viet Nam.\n   Big stick-up foiled the other day not far from our tearass home.  and a coloured man was mentioned as one of the heisters.

'cept the first day, part of which was spent going 'round and 'round Le Havre (The Harbor) rather than trying to enter, a\/c 100-odd\n\nmile gale. So the passengers had to be put up in Le Havre hotels at, I suspect, double underline:  our expense, the line being heavily subsidized. The fascist bum, Dali, \nwas on board, and I was shown his suite by an Englishman expatriate 1st class steward, who also showed me other sumptuous cabins. Dali, this\nsteward says, is a free loader who never tips but is very demanding, I sat on a bench after the ship docked, and Dali came and sat facing the other way.\nLooks like a tired old Ben Reitman close up.

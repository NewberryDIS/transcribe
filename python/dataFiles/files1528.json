I can [ unclear] mornings only\nMr. Carl B. Rodin:\n\n     Several weeks ago, I half finished a Daily News Editorial in which I meant to follow up your celebration of the service rendered by the central building since its opening seventy- five years ago.  I have withheld it from publication until there might be some news value in playing up and developing the branch libraries and stations.  Your interesting statement of the failure to recover the large circulation of books and attendance of readers registered before the depression gives occasion for finishing and printing my plea for the cooperation of the people living near the branches and deposit stations.\n    The increased income appropriated by the legislature to equip all deposits with new accessions to replace the worn out volumes in use until they were used up, and to complete the files of\nperiodicals the library subscriptions to which had to be suspended.\n\n    There is much to encourage the peoples' cooperation with the library management in increasing the attraction and equipment of the branches and much in their depletion to account for the decreased circulation and attendance.\n\n    Incidentally such encouragements wild include credits due to certain groups for their loyal courage during the long depression and for their cooperation in providing increased appropriations to the state library funds.  These groups include the staff, faithfully serving against great odds; the legislators who secured these increased appropriations; and the Legion and other organizations of veterans who might have still further embarrassed the critical situations by complaints the special privileges granted to them when the building funds were offered on condition that the great cental building should be erected as a memorial to the veterans of the Civil War.\n\n    I should hope that these facts to be stated and these credits to be cited would forstall any criticism which has been so loyally withheld.  But I should be put wise as to the delicacy involved in paying each of these tributes.\n\n    To this end I need the cautionary advice of yourself and Mr. Wilson.  Were I able to move about I would seek an immediate interview with both of you at the Library.  But since my weak hear forbids any such risks I must depend upon both of you either to run out here to see me for an hour's interview or fully advise me so that I may be helpfully encouraging and in   no respect harmful in what should be my next editorial in the Daily News.  Let me now at once what help I my promptly expect from you and greatly oblige your fellow director of long ago and your comrade in the good fellowship of our public Library service.\n\nGraham Taylor","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":133733,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/133733","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3744e53178351968c9c7895281a3a2f6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3744e53178351968c9c7895281a3a2f6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3744e53178351968c9c7895281a3a2f6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3744e53178351968c9c7895281a3a2f6.jpg"},"added":"2023-01-11T22:38:50+00:00","modified":"2023-05-31T19:03:34+00:00","filename":"3744e53178351968c9c7895281a3a2f6.jpg","authentication":"ef1178e5d51e2c1071bd40baa2f05bf6","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"992819118805867_midwest_ms_taylor_box_00010_fl_00391_000008.jpg","size":181631,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":932,"resolution_y":1200,"compression_ratio":0.054134179780639009316178800190755282528698444366455078125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Graham Taylor papers [box 00010], 1820-1975"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230110"],"Caption-Abstract":["Forms part of the Midwest Manuscript Collection (Newberry Library)"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Graham Taylor papers [box 00010], 1820-1975"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230110"],"Caption-Abstract":["Forms part of the Midwest Manuscript Collection (Newberry Library)"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Graham Taylor papers [box 00010], 1820-1975"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230110"],"Caption-Abstract":["Forms part of the Midwest Manuscript Collection (Newberry Library)"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1528,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1528","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Telephone Monroe 1030                                                                                                 Taylor Graham\nChicago Commons, Grand Ave. and Morgan Street\nMay 13\/31\nMy dear Mr [Rosewald?],\n[unclear] birthday greeting, red by Mr [Friedman?] to my comrades of the [M.V.

Pretty badly, as a matter of grim fact.  Your old colleague Hiawatha considers me \"the most dangerous and influential member of the faculty,\" and has sworn to fire me; for my part, I am convinced he is as mad as the proverbial March hare, and a punitive right-wing witch hunter to boot.  Und so.  There is not, I assume, much question over who will win, but I'll go down fighting.  We have been fighting here, for the past 3 months, and it has been the good fight, for, I believe firmly, the side of life as opposed to death.  It was a pretty good strike.  I learned a lot:  how to be a picket captain; that day after day in the rain would not melt me; that cops are not my friends; that there can be such a thing (even among teachers) as solidarity; that a minority can hang tough; that it is possible to work, and to work well with these black kids, despite their tremendous sense of outrage--that if one can put something on the line, one can gain a measure of trust, but only by commiting [sic] oneself.  And, alas, I've learned that nothing is simple.  We creaked back in with a lousy settlement, minus 2 months' salary, and with matters still unresolved.  It is like teaching in a concentration camp, now, and I'm unsettled as hell.  I feel as schizoid as we all do here.  Part of us wants to partake of the simpler attitudes of the picket line, while part wants to take over, despite the odds, the governance of the institution.  I don't give myself long here, but I'm going to try to hang on another year --partly because the black kids have asked me to.\n   Your lecture tour sounds great.  Sure, the company is pretty fast, but you've got the credentials.  I'm using underlined:  The Disinherited this year in a weird and wild class called \"Literature and Revolution\" (filled with black, Third World, and striking students); that wonderful passage dealing with the men working on the road building is beautifully vital.\n\nadded to typescript in handwriting\n\n   I'll be in touch.  And I'll give  your love to Hiawatha if he comes back from praying (sp.?) with Nixon.\n   If you discover any nice documents at the U. of Conn. bash, grab a copy for me.\n\nAll the best,  Eric\nP.S.  It's St. Pat's day.  They used to call me Sullivan when I was a tad in Boston. Anyone can pass, I guess.  Cheers.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":143138,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/143138","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f8620247f952edb37934214085a31688.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f8620247f952edb37934214085a31688.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f8620247f952edb37934214085a31688.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f8620247f952edb37934214085a31688.jpg"},"added":"2023-04-04T19:23:20+00:00","modified":"2023-06-30T02:39:22+00:00","filename":"f8620247f952edb37934214085a31688.jpg","authentication":"bc6d09b5aaa48bdfbcd7c88a25ead639","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"992006198805867_midwest_ms_conroy_box_00029_fl_01462_000029.jpg","size":106880,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":940,"resolution_y":1200,"compression_ratio":0.031583924349881796478367590452762669883668422698974609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00029], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00029], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ObjectName":["Jack Conroy papers [box 00029], 1924-1991"],"Keywords":["handwritten-ms-20230403"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1624,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1624","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"in pencil 1961\nSAN FRANCISCO STATE COLLEGE\n1600 Holloway Avenue  San Francisco, California 94132\nSchool of Humanities\nMay 7\nDear Jack:\n\nEnclosed is my piece on Kirkland; I'm not sure it will be of any help - but...\n\nZwy? is a helluva interesting book because, as a said in a book I wrote\non S.

They show deep\nculture, but you don't write like a college professor, a brand of writing that I hate. You write as though\nyou've always lived with and loved books, but also as if you had lived a life of your own, and felt\nthem as something more than literature.

Magnolia  Chicago 60640\nJan. 8, 1974\nDear Jack,\n\nThank you for the greeting you and Gladys send, and especially for your note...Bunni tried to get \"Writers in Revolt\"\n\nat Volume One bookstore in Old town - never heard of it (tell your published). So yesterday I went to Kroch's downtown\nfor it. Oh Jack - it's marvelous! And, for me, it comes at just the right time. My own book \"Two Artists\" is devoted half to\nRoff Bemen and art colony days of the thirties; even the second part, about Bunni's struggles as a sculptor demonstrates today's\nneed for revolt. Part I is finished, thirteen episodes, but Part II is a lot harder. Bunni is a much more complex artist that Roff\n(whose paintings were representative window scenes and landscapes, much like Manet's). And of course Bunni is very much\nalive and at first wanted mt to desist, objected to a biographical account (the book is semi-fiction) and \"Write a novel about me\ninstead.\" But when he realized it was this or nothing, he did want his sculpture described and gave me the green light.\n\nThe clipping I've enclosed is one example of the commercial path taken by so many artists today. Jim used to be an excellent\n\npainter and an idealist, studying Buddhist  philosophy, But finally, unable to withstand pressures from his social-climbing wife, he\ngave up all painting for this crappy Krimpart.\n\nYour introduction amazed me! I'd no idea who it really was that Nelson brought to Chicago. The history you give is fascinating and\n\nyour own part in it a glorious one.

Magnolia\nChicago ILL 60640\n2-22-75\nDear Jack,\nBefore I speak of Roberto, I'm anxious to know if you or anyone you know of, would have the time & inclination to read my book (the ms.) At first Margot Bemen,\nRoff's younger daughter, was not only eager to read it but to add to it her own ideas about her father, lend a photograph of a landscape similar to the view from my bedroom window - a happy reminder of days with Roff, etc. Then - after I mailed her a copy, she won't even open it! Finally when I tired of her \"reasons\" (actually she's afraid what she'd read would wipe out some of the jealous hatred towards me she's had since I first entered Roff's life; her father - fixation, possessiveness is so deep that years with psychiatrists still haven't made a dent in it). Anyhow she's offered to buy the stamps herself & send it on to anyone I tell her about. Meridel wrote me she hopes to see me next summer & wants to read it but my experience with her last summer warns me she's not reliable these days - my money is scant, I may have to move from here - building bought by tenants who prefer my apt, etc. If I finally do see Meridel and I can be with her while she reads some of it, fine.

Bunni reports that when he first went to Alexis's looking for a place to sleep (Alexis is the photographer that owns the farm - orchard where Bunni was given a 2-story garage for a studio - he's made it charming! - I've been there twice & was supposed to go again but the flu had started) - Roberto looked like a seedy tramp.

I wasn't surprised as a picture of him in one of the papers showed something similar. I'm afraid this is the result of all his spitefulness.

We steal the Indian's lands and their hunting grounds and all that they have to subsist upon, and we are not punished; but when a few individuals amongst them, where they have no power or laws to punish, retalliate, they (and not they alone, but the innocent with the guilty) are punished with indiscrinate death---cut down with sabers and shot down with revolvers by the cavalry of our country---killed to the last man, and that by a secret and cowardly surprise!\n\n    These 173 Piegans, to have been destroyed whilst they killed but one soldier, must have been attacked in their sleep, and without their weapons at command; and if so, could have been captured as prisoners of war, and the guilty punished. How much more this would have tended to the peace of the frontier, and comported with the honour and magnanimity of a great and invincible nation\n    It is a mistaken (though a popular) notion, that \"striking these people hard\", (slaughtering them indiscriminately as has been seen) is the surest mode of keeping the peace: but when the world will have learned as much of the Indian character as I have learned, they will find that such murderous and cowardly attacks are the surest means of throwing the whole frontier into the most horrible and unrelenting state of warfare.\n    If I am speaking strong it is because the time has come for speaking strong, and because my words are on the side of policy and humanity, and not of blood and butchery. I have no shame or fear in speaking plainly for an oppressed and murdered people, and who cannot speak for themselves. These assassinated people were my friends. Look into the catalogue of my Indian portraits, and the Piegan chief, Stu-mik-o-suks will be found, and his wife and grandson, who was to have been his successor. These people treated me with kindness, and my heart sickens at the fate they have met at the hands of an artful, designing, and wicked enemy.\n    By no system of jurisprudence on the face of the Earth, excepting in our great and glorious country, is theft (or even murder) punished indiscriminately with death--the innocent with the guilty, and that on onesided evidence, without a hearing, and without judge or jury; nor is there any military code recognized by the laws of nations, by which towns and cities (even of nations actually at war) with their inhabitants, to the last man, woman and child, are destroyed, their houses burned, and their horses driven off as booty--nor does the Constitution of our own, or any other country, rest in its Secretary oat War or Generals of its armies, a power over the life and death of whole communities or individuals, either in time of war or of peace; and woe would be to any crowned head tyrant or not, in the old world, who would sentence to death on onesided evidence, and issue an order for their secret execution, an entire community of 173 persons.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":72383,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/72383","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/6d49f019a99acbf9c911b210a3bd5d9a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/6d49f019a99acbf9c911b210a3bd5d9a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/6d49f019a99acbf9c911b210a3bd5d9a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6d49f019a99acbf9c911b210a3bd5d9a.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-03T16:07:29+00:00","modified":"2020-03-30T13:36:06+00:00","filename":"6d49f019a99acbf9c911b210a3bd5d9a.jpg","authentication":"16a97cbd1c2720cf6180143a34e03496","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_146_00016_o2.jpg","size":2194095,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2853,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.07120818242006500542462532621357240714132785797119140625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120501"],"TimeCreated":["101017+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120501"],"TimeCreated":["101017+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20120501"],"TimeCreated":["101017+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6d49f019a99acbf9c911b210a3bd5d9a.jpg","FileDateTime":1522771631,"FileSize":2194095,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2853\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2853,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:05:10 10:47:40","Exif_IFD_Pointer":154},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:01 10:10:17","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:01 10:10:17","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":7,"SubSecTimeOriginal":7,"SubSecTimeDigitized":7,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2172,"ExifImageLength":2740,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1066,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1066","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The greatest, the most powerful, and the most free nation on the Earth ought to be the most lenient;

They have a perfect right to say--\"that this band of Government forces, with a Col. Baker at their head, in coldblood, and without the fear of God before their eys, deliberately and wickedly designed to destroy and pillage an Indian village (of a tribe with which the Government was not at war) in the coldest regions of the Rocky Mountains, by stealthily marching upon it in the middle of winter, when its inmates were hemmed in by snowdrifts, and with their wives and children were living on the scanty food laid in for their winter's subsistence; and that then and there in the darkness of night, with sabres and revolvers, they massacred the entire population---destroyed their houses and provisions, and stole 300 horses, of the value of 20,000 dollars.    And they will not forget, nor allow the world to forget, the names of Chivington and Baker; and they will have a right to say, that the murders by Cain, by Pizzarro, and by Traupmann, were not half so bad as theirs---and that the time has come when Fame should change ends with his trumpet, and blow shame! Shame!! through the land, and even to the steps and doors of the Capitol.\n\nMy Dear Sir, I wish that my comments could end here; but to your second inquiry, as to the probable extermination of the Indian tribes, there are yet due a few words, and which the perusal? unclear of General Sheridans letter of the 18th Mar. which you have just handed me, enables me more promptly and confidently to add, than I could have done at an earlier period. From his justification in this, of the Piegan butchery, and his dictations foreshadowing other butcheries yet to be made, nothing else than the certainty of contemplated extermination can possible be deducted from it.\n\n    This extraordinary letter, in which the writer says that he has command over more than five thousand miles of frontier and consequently, (as exemplified in the Piegan massacre) the lives of more than 200,000 human beings at his mercy, demands the whole force and application of public scrutiny; and no other man living can so well appreciate and explain its fallacies and its errors, as myself, having been over and through the whole of those frontiers, and been treated with honour and kindness in every tribe of

\nThe Commanding General tells us that he has nothing to do with the Indian affairs excepting to protect the lives of the settlers; and in the same letter, that \"the Indians must all be forced into the Reservations by his troops, and by his troops be held there\"; and political adherants to his policy tell us that \"the Indian wars are waged only for the protection of the pioneers--that they are a great expense to the Government, and that nothing is gained by them\"; but the whole of this is untrue. These wars and massacres will be the death of the pioneers; and whatever the cost of the Indian wars, they are the most profitable speculations which the government is engaged in. \nEvery battle that the Government fights with the Indians is sure to be a government victory. Every Indian war with the United States, no matter who is the cause of it, is a forfeiture of annuities, and who is to add up and tell us the millions on millions of profits to the Government, by annuities thus stopped? \nThe three massacres of the Cheyennes and Arapahos, with the butchery of the Pi\u00e9gans, are a gain to the government, of at least 500. millions of aces of land which the government puts into the market at Six Shillings (a dollar and a quarter) per acre; and the horses stolen in the same massacres, worth at least, 60.000 dollars. \nWhat a spectral picture have we before us when we close our eyes, of well fed soldiers entering the wigwams of these starving and unsuspecting people, with sabres in hand splitting down the heads and mangling the bodies of women and children, crying and imploring for mercy!  What a school of practice, these slaughterhouses for American Soldiers; and if all the tribes are yet to be \"forced\" from their countries by the troops, where are these butcheries to stop, (who can solve the problem) if not only the disgrace of such transactions, but the guilt of such wanton cruelties, is to be condoned by the people of our country? \nIt may be policy in a great General, wielding the swords of a great army upon a naked and defenceless people, in their own country, and their own wigwams, to stigmatize them as \"fiends\", though most valient fighting men take a satisfaction in magnifying their enemy. When I visited these wild and hospitable people and shook the hands of more than half a million, in their own dwelling, they certainly were not (collectively) fiends; and if they deserve the epithet at this time, it is because the raids of military, and the butcheries by the United States troops in their counties had made them such. \nThere are fiends in all societies,","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":72387,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/72387","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/162042c74f726157363f11ba31650adf.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/162042c74f726157363f11ba31650adf.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/162042c74f726157363f11ba31650adf.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/162042c74f726157363f11ba31650adf.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-03T16:07:34+00:00","modified":"2020-03-31T03:05:23+00:00","filename":"162042c74f726157363f11ba31650adf.jpg","authentication":"14a01c5461d3583377d8d0e0ca8ff28d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_146_00020_o2.jpg","size":2202969,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2833,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.07200092167706000079174799566317233256995677947998046875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120501"],"TimeCreated":["101126+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120501"],"TimeCreated":["101126+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20120501"],"TimeCreated":["101126+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"162042c74f726157363f11ba31650adf.jpg","FileDateTime":1522771631,"FileSize":2202969,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2833\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2833,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:05:10 10:48:44","Exif_IFD_Pointer":154},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:01 10:11:26","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:01 10:11:26","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":77,"SubSecTimeOriginal":77,"SubSecTimeDigitized":77,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2145,"ExifImageLength":2725,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1066,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1066","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"6 both white and red, but that dont make a nation of fiends. Any nation of people on the face of the Earth, driven out of their country, and from the graves of their parents and children, and \"forced into their last ditch,\" by the weapons of soldiery, and the fiendish use of them will become fiends.\nThe world know that I have devoted a long life of toil with many privations, in preserving for history and ethnology, what I have seen and admired amongst the North American Indians before \"fiends\" got amongst them, and they will easily appreciate the painful feelings I have at seeing the \"Conquering hero\", with more than 5000 miles of frontier under his command and at least the lives of 200.000 humans beings yet at his mercy (of which he is judge, jury, and executioner) beginning his onslaught as he has done with the Pi\u00e9gans, and proclaiming in his letter, the coming fate of the rest.\nThe removal of Indians into the Reservations, is generally thought to be an easy and a good thing, because people mostly have but an imperfect knowledge of it and its results. Heretofore the credulous Indians have been cajoled into them, being told that there they would be out of the reach of civilization, and have an abundance of game; but by the present policy, when they are no longer willing to move, they are to be \"forced\" into them.\nEvery part of the continent, from ocean to ocean, was found peopled with savages, each tribe claiming and hunting over a tract of country just supplying them food enough for their subsistence; and so they have remained to the present day, where they have not been removed. Each tribe, jealous of its own boundaries and its game, has mostly held the surrounding tribes in a state of hostility and warfare; and the consequence of this is, that in any, the remotest part of the great West, every tract of country into which a removed tribe as placed, (it it be capable of sustaining a population) is already peopled with Indians who claim it as their birthright--their own, and every such tract, even to the Pacific coast, is at this time more or less occupied also, by a squatter population of whites.\nThe results of removing tribes of Indians into these reserves, therefore, are trespass on the rights of other Indians, under new and deadly feuds of both parties, and death from starvation, where there is an increase of consumers, and an absolute deficiency of food; and in all the reservations the other misfortune of the Indians, (and which has been the principal cause of their removals) their destructive contiguity to white men, is actually increased; as all the arable lands in the remote reservations will be occupied, even before the Indians get there, by squatters who get their farms on the Indian Reserves for nothing.\nThe original occupiers and owners of the soil, thus trespassed upon by two enemies, and the feuds and warfare that must consequently arise with United States troops, already trained in butcheries, and sworn \"to protect the settlers\" instead of the fiends\") it is easy to see in the horizon, the reality of Extermination about which you enquire -- the going down of the sun (and its last glimmering rays) of the North American Indians.

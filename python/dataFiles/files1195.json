Our meat was soon roasting before the fire but the storm increasing in violence so that it became necessary to build a shelter over the fire to keep the rain from putting it out. this was done by building a Brush house as it is termed over the fire. from a ridge pole laid into two forks and the Brush roof made sloping each way and thus much rain was kept out of the fire and consequently fire easier kept up. The day wore away gradually but the rain and snow increased. Our tent was small and open at the ends and only a partial protection: night set in.  the cold winds, snow & rain was continually beating in upon us. We passed an uncomfortable night. Our fire was kept up all the time. no one unless it was poor Davenport got any sleep - The night passed away drearily and never was the appearance of morning looked forward to more anxiously.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":91313,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/91313","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/ecfccf01b0377ffbd4d0bdbb446689d2.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/ecfccf01b0377ffbd4d0bdbb446689d2.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/ecfccf01b0377ffbd4d0bdbb446689d2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ecfccf01b0377ffbd4d0bdbb446689d2.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-05T23:57:33+00:00","modified":"2020-07-01T22:51:54+00:00","filename":"ecfccf01b0377ffbd4d0bdbb446689d2.jpg","authentication":"4e281a95c7dd51917f6caffcc93de2fa","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"GR_4683-3_0017r_o2.jpg","size":1530518,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1838,"resolution_y":2944,"compression_ratio":0.094283104469256}},"item":{"id":1195,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1195","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"12\nsurrounding mountains for many miles in every direction.

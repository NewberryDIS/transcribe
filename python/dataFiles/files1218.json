I expect she misses the vegetables so fresh from the garden, the strawberries, which are abundant, the flowers & the children, but we'll try to make her comfortable as we can.

The city have purchased the burnt district for $19.000, intending to ter-\nrace and turf it, and adorn it with goodly trees \nand shrubs to beautify and render health the \ncity.  Many think it a foolish plan.  We went to \nMount Hope the other day, Samuel has engaged \na man to grade and turf our lot and next spring \nwe hope to have some more trees out there.    It has \nbeen said that willows would not grow well there, \nbut many have tried them recently and find they \nthrive well.  The stones you selected in Boston \nhave come.  I was getting along wonderfully gaining \nvery fast four or five weeks ago, but have relapsed \nwith the same old state pretty much.  I do manage \nto get about the house on my feet however, just what \nis necessary.  Samuel went this morning to see \nDr Rich.  I expect him today to see what can be","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95355,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95355","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ae0cbf225e0168cf2dbbf669b120d666.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ae0cbf225e0168cf2dbbf669b120d666.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ae0cbf225e0168cf2dbbf669b120d666.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ae0cbf225e0168cf2dbbf669b120d666.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:25:03+00:00","modified":"2020-06-23T05:06:53+00:00","filename":"ae0cbf225e0168cf2dbbf669b120d666.jpg","authentication":"fee2fba7b18594cf8fdbdad20c019872","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_37_004_003_o2.jpg","size":1463656,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2869,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047237261660406003327405954905771068297326564788818359375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["031823"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["031823"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["031823"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ae0cbf225e0168cf2dbbf669b120d666.jpg","FileDateTime":1586654669,"FileSize":1463656,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2869\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2869,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 10:26:44","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:08 03:18:23","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:08 03:18:23","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2962,"ExifImageLength":3716,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1218,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1218","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"done for the critter.

I rejoiced as much to find that you had at last received letter from us.  It seems to me there must have been some unusual delay about them.  You say we need feel no anxiety  about your health, because you are always so careful.  I think you try and intend to take proper care of yourself, but still it can hardly help feeling anxious about you, in that unhealthy again, so far from friends and home.  I suppose the warm weather and sickly season are nearly over now.  \nI suppose you are doing pretty well there in the way of property, but I hope you will be able to find a good situation nearer home before long.\nIt is very sickly in Bangor now- dysentery and bowel complaints are very prevalent.  I was quite unwell for a week with Diarrhea - am better now though I have hardly recovered my strength yet.  Samuel has been growing very poor, and running down hill for a good many weeks, and a little more than a week since he was obliged to give up to a kind of slow billious fever.  The doctor has been in most every day for a week.  His fever has not been violent at all, and has mostly left him now.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95358","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/56e82d8358699b853204e55e71c3a519.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/56e82d8358699b853204e55e71c3a519.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/56e82d8358699b853204e55e71c3a519.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/56e82d8358699b853204e55e71c3a519.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:25:08+00:00","modified":"2020-06-23T05:11:48+00:00","filename":"56e82d8358699b853204e55e71c3a519.jpg","authentication":"33dbf043f93993ce90945be1147f27ac","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_37_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1460566,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2833,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04773653109516200199191615638483199290931224822998046875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["031844"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["031844"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["031844"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"56e82d8358699b853204e55e71c3a519.jpg","FileDateTime":1586654669,"FileSize":1460566,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2833\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2833,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 10:26:50","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:08 03:18:44","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:08 03:18:44","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2936,"ExifImageLength":3730,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1218,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1218","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Lucy & Mother Bangor Aug. 25, 1851\nMt.

His appetite is returning, and we hope he will be about in a few days.  He never was sick a day before since he can remember.  It is very hard for him to be away from the mill just now, but he takes it very patiently.  The neighbors are very kind all of them, and Uncle Natty is particularly attentive - calls once or twice a day and offers his services abundantly.   He seems to have taken quite a notion to Samuel.  People remark it, say that Mr Roberts and his wife were sick all winter and he never called once!  I have written you all about it, but perhaps you never got the letter, so I will tell you again that five or six weeks ago I begun to get well really fast all at once.  Dr Mc Ruen left me some new medicine about that time - don't know whether that gave me a start or not.  I gained wonderfully for about a fortnight - lost my chair upstairs, went afoot all about the house, got up stairs alone two or three times, and went out round the side of the house twice well.  I was greatly rejoiced and very careful too, but alack and alas!  Nobody knows how nor why I got movement again.  I have been able even since however with the exception of a few days in this ill time to get about the house what is necessary without the chair.  A few days before Samuel was taken sick, I took a notion to send for Dr Rich and see what he could do for me.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95359,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95359","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5537a81283b3defb705426a8c6d93a15.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5537a81283b3defb705426a8c6d93a15.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5537a81283b3defb705426a8c6d93a15.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5537a81283b3defb705426a8c6d93a15.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:25:09+00:00","modified":"2020-06-23T05:14:04+00:00","filename":"5537a81283b3defb705426a8c6d93a15.jpg","authentication":"c135728f9d1763635afd1a570b49dca6","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_37_005_003_o2.jpg","size":1351214,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2748,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0455285325354470027381381669329130090773105621337890625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["031848"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["031848"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["031848"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5537a81283b3defb705426a8c6d93a15.jpg","FileDateTime":1586654670,"FileSize":1351214,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2748\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2748,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 10:26:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:08 03:18:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:08 03:18:48","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2894,"ExifImageLength":3791,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1218,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1218","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"His opinion coincides precisely with Dr Mc Ruen's.

Well, we were both of course quite fatigued on our arrival and next day felt better, but on the second morning Samuel thought a salt water bath would be good for him, & accordingly went into the river before sunrise.  It being rather a cool morning, before he got dressed and back to the house, he was perfectly chilled through.  This brought on quite an attack of his fever again & for a day or two I felt quite anxious about how we should both get home. but we called in the Dr. and after taking an emetic etc, he got better & by the first boat (yesterday) we started for home, & glad enough we were to get here last night.  Samuel is pretty weak- sweats a good deal nights, but seems to be gaining now, and with care we hope will soon be well.  We were helped along nicely on our way home by stewards, passengers etc.  Our landlady was very kind & attentive.  The Dr. for five calls and performing the office of barber once, charged the monstrous sum or $1.00!  He only had a few steps to walk however. I think is probable that if I could bathe in salt water & breathe the good sea air for some time it might be beneficial, but feeling fatigued & anxious all the time, I don't see as I am any better.  I am using Oil Cajuput externally, which I think does strengthen my back some, but it is a poor good for nothing back now.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95363,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95363","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5bfbf7096f7b9e4dc23f32b8270624bf.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5bfbf7096f7b9e4dc23f32b8270624bf.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5bfbf7096f7b9e4dc23f32b8270624bf.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5bfbf7096f7b9e4dc23f32b8270624bf.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:25:15+00:00","modified":"2020-07-08T02:13:01+00:00","filename":"5bfbf7096f7b9e4dc23f32b8270624bf.jpg","authentication":"ef93f47785bcb85b1867d18975893e52","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_37_006_003_o2.jpg","size":1450853,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2768,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048532601423677997065642131246931967325508594512939453125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["031916"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["031916"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["031916"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5bfbf7096f7b9e4dc23f32b8270624bf.jpg","FileDateTime":1586654670,"FileSize":1450853,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2768\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2768,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 10:27:01","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.07692307692307699673595067224596277810633182525634765625,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:08 03:19:16","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:08 03:19:16","ShutterSpeedValue":3.700439999999999951540985421161167323589324951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"SubSecTimeOriginal":77,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2889,"ExifImageLength":3757,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1218,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1218","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I don't feel as if I can realise how far away from us you are, so well as Anne & Eliab can.

Eliab had previously left Bangor for \"parts unknown\", and Samuel is so \"very busy\", as usual, that I suppose it devolves on me to answer them both - and as you will be saying something if you don't get a letter about so often. I may as well write at once.\n                            You will probably have heard from Eliab before this reaches you - He went away because he had no business here, and was tired of loafing - Said he should go first to Montague and talk with cousins Joseph and Humphrey, and from there to Albany. Perhaps he wrote you about three brothers by the name of Butts - who were connected in business, having three different establishments, in Albany, Buffalo and Cleveland - with whom he had some talk while on his journey west in the summer. He thought by going to Albany, he could ascertain if they wanted him in either place - if they did not, he seemed to think he should attend school somewhere in Mass. this winter, unless something else should \"turn up\".

He presented Some Resolutions relative to seceding from the A. B. C. F. M. as a Conference, if the Board continued to uphold such doings. The Res. did not take well with Some of the ministers. They talked, got earnest, grew warm, and finally excited, - too much to for their own good or that of the people. They at length concluded to appoint a discretionary Committee to consider the expediency of calling a convention of the conference to discuss The Resolutions. I hope Said Convention will be convened, and let all who wish attend, So as to have a full understanding & get the minds of the members of the Several churches on the Subject of Slavery. Mr. Parker did 'cut' the Board and criticise their report pretty severely.

I wish you could have heard him in his peculiar way, \"Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer.\" He & Mr. Lesley talked that the Report was on which common people can not understand, whereas men of their talents & learning ought to know enough to write so as to be intelligible to all. &c.&c.&c. They vexed some of the good people as did Thomas, Mr. Willard &c. with their abolition talk. In the P.M. Mr. Drake from Garland, preached an excellent sermon. Evening, Mr. Parker. Excellent of course. Charles went to Bangor last week, carried his hog, got .07 for 1\/2, and 6 1\/2 for 1\/2. Hog a year old weighed 360 lbs. Very good they said. Had to pay proceeds right away for provisions & pay Almeda borrowed money. This week Wednes & Thurs. he went to Lincoln with 36 bu. of oats, tandem team, Nelly & Donk, worked admirably; got .50 per bu. At Bangor only, .40 cts. Paid it on his way home to Rollins the Publican. Is going with another load soon. Hope he'll be able to furnish you some money out of oats or hay. Rollins was at Richmand & neighboring towns recently. Did'nt know you was there. Was sorry. Would have called. Said 'twas very sickly about then. Small pox at Canaan. There has been one case & some say more in Bangor. People got excited & accounts are exagerated.  Seems to me, however, there is some reason for alarm. People at least ought to be vaccinated. Some Drs. \nsay once in 7 years. If so, we ought all to attend to it. Report says a physician in Canaan has been indicted for spreading purposely the disease. Am glad you'll write to [unclear] Hills folks dislike him much and you know are always rather heartless. His school is only a fortnight longer. Harvey, teaching in Brownville, enters the Medical School at Brunswick in Spring. Barker calls him one of the finest fellows in the world. If so, scrape acquaintance. John Barker died a few days ago. Was unwell, quite, went with his brother to Ellsworth, grew worse, started for home and died on the way.

Don't you open your lips om the subject when you write home nor to any body. D'ye hear? Everett found out there was a little boot due C. from Wm Hamlen for the steers & served another trustee writ! and the same day sent Jo Chase to take Nelly, which is like taking C's eye teeth!

C. went down and settled all up with Everett, who threw in 12.50 of his account, gave him his note for 3000 to be paid next Sept. He gets back the Brownville lumber, Rider money & Hamlen money.

Why is it:? We have thought of every possible reason, and worried ourselves with many \"what ifs\". It was Thanksgiving day when your last letter was started, Nov. 27. Christmas and New Years have come and gone since then, and in our hearts we wished you all joy & happiness, though we did not write it. I have written once since receiving your last. Mother fears you are sick, too sick to write, but I tell her if you were sick you would certainly have some one else write. I can think of no reason except that the mails may be more irregular in winter, on account of bad travelling. I shall send this today, hopping however to get a letter from you tonight. Samuel has been at home once, is now gone again. His new Pony works nicely. We had a nice New Years letter from Anna last night. She seems to enjoy herself nicely with her chum Miss Woodbury, but I think she longs to be free from the confinement of school teaching. I should think she would. I wish she would content herself to come and live with us in our hearts and homes. I think she might enjoy herself very well with me and at Cedar Grove, and make the time pass very pleasantly.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95388,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95388","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5c51b1ac0423565c4ba89b916fa4d15e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5c51b1ac0423565c4ba89b916fa4d15e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5c51b1ac0423565c4ba89b916fa4d15e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5c51b1ac0423565c4ba89b916fa4d15e.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:25:50+00:00","modified":"2020-07-08T03:35:41+00:00","filename":"5c51b1ac0423565c4ba89b916fa4d15e.jpg","authentication":"7a630260ab3277e8c6d47770eee8372d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_38_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1357260,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2890,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04348519800076899866070334610412828624248504638671875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180610"],"TimeCreated":["234559"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180610"],"TimeCreated":["234559"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180610"],"TimeCreated":["234559"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5c51b1ac0423565c4ba89b916fa4d15e.jpg","FileDateTime":1586654671,"FileSize":1357260,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2890\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2890,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 15:59:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:10 23:45:59","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:10 23:45:59","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2989,"ExifImageLength":3723,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1218,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1218","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"It would be such a comfort to Mother, too, to have her nearer to her.

It was almost a month between your last and the previous one we think these must have been on lost.\nIt is a bright, beautiful day, though rather cold, I believe. People say we have had a very severe winter continued cold weather and an unusual number of severe storms. I can say very little about it from experience, as I have kept housed most of the time. Samuel came home a week ago, after a fortnight absence. went away again last Monday to be gone three weeks. This route is nearly the same as last winter, I believe. I am hoping to go to Milo while he is out next time if he can spare time. My health is improving fast I think. I have been steadily growing better, without having any pull backs, for several weeks. Last sabbath P.M. I went to meeting at Hammond St. for the first time. I got pretty tired, but just as well next morning, as you will see when I tell you that I washed the dished, trimmed the camps, made my bed, swept and dusted the bedroom & sitting room, polished the stone, and washed, in one water, seven or eight sizable articles.

You imagine about Samuel's sealing? I don't know how many times, but he said he should probably made about $150.00 - not so much as last winter. He had a home and comes home once in two or three weeks. \nMr. Tebbets and two other joiners are at work on our house, getting out the finish. It will probably be completed from garret to cellar by the last of the summer if not before. We shall be in no haste to move in, as the paint and plastering should be well seasoned. Temperance matters prosper finely in Bangor. A new course has been adopted recently with the rumsellers that if indicting them before grand jury. Most plead guilty two stood trial and was fined $100.00 and costs, some fifty more. They have appealed and will doubtless be beaten again. We are having some excellent lectures this winter. A course before the mercantile and then before the Mechanic's Association, and a series on sabbath evening upon various subjects selected by different clergymen for the benefits of the community, bu the Bangor ministries of all denominations. I regret very much that Samuel is away, so as not to hear them. They have, so far, had a better class of Lecturers then usual, I should think. Gov.

I am glad your health and spirits are so good, but beg you will flatter yourself too much with regard to their remaining so. Though the warm weather, if you should decide to stay there.\nIf you do remain, you will of course come and make us a good visit. We shall be willing to wait for it till midsummer, if by so doing, we can have a longer one. I seriously warn you not to come East with the intention of stopping but a day or two! I want, if possible, that you and Anna should arrange matters so as to come together_it will be so pleasant for all. I wish we might be established in our new house before you come, but we shall not probably move in before the last of the summer. One week ago yesterday Samuel and I went to Milo. We had a very pleasant visit_staid three days. Albina seemed good, pleasant, agreeable and sisterly.

Bangor, ME\nJonesboro Ill. April 21. 1852\nBangor March 22, 1852\nDear Brother Isaac\nYour last letter was received a few days since - we have been waiting, hoping to receive another letter from Eliab before writing. Perhaps you have heard from him, however, more and oftener than we have. About a week since we received a lot dated as North Hampton Water Cure. He has put himself under the care of Dr. Munde. He wrote himself, but wrote in bed . as usual he expressed himself very indefinitely- did not tell whether he was much worse or not. We feel very anxious about him - more so if possible than we should if we knew he was very sick, and he had told us all about it. We are confidently expecting a letter today from him. He does wrong - so does any one when away from home, and not well, not to tell exactly how he is. I feel very anxious about him. I fear he has been ambitious and studied to hard. I think if he had gone to school with no desire and consequently made no effort to distinguish himself, but merely to pass way the time, so as not to get uneasy as he would certainly very soon do without any employment, it might have been conducive to his health & happiness. That course, however, would probably be a difficult one for him perhaps for any of us.\nWe feel disappointed as your not coming\n$25. I have not mentioned it before. Say nothing unless you think but to have it done.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95406,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95406","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7e181db029b468f423096a2b678a6be6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7e181db029b468f423096a2b678a6be6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7e181db029b468f423096a2b678a6be6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7e181db029b468f423096a2b678a6be6.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:26:14+00:00","modified":"2020-07-08T04:29:17+00:00","filename":"7e181db029b468f423096a2b678a6be6.jpg","authentication":"a7a096182b6c79f86f2c38659c5eeaad","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_38_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1279131,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2868,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041296393150473002797706811861644382588565349578857421875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180610"],"TimeCreated":["234801"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180610"],"TimeCreated":["234801"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180610"],"TimeCreated":["234801"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7e181db029b468f423096a2b678a6be6.jpg","FileDateTime":1586654672,"FileSize":1279131,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2868\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2868,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 16:00:43","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:10 23:48:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:10 23:48:01","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2961,"ExifImageLength":3716,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1218,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1218","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"home this spring, and yet of course would not wish it if it would endanger your health.

The substance of the matter is, he wants to be an Engineer, but don't know how to begin. One Mr. Deane of Winthrop teaches Engineering, but asks eight dollars a year tuition and $2 per week board, which makes it rather expensive. William has a natural turn for Mathematics & has paid considerable attention to it. Understands the theory of Surveying well to. He is tall awkward, bashful, green- taught school successfully last winter. Is determined to settle in the western states somewhere. His father wishes to know if you would be willing to take him with you, and teach and help him along as you can. He will pay you what is right for your trouble- he will go right on any time you would wish.

I have sawed mostly my own logs\/ have sawed about 300,000 ft by the thousand at 2 3\/8$) I paid $1260. for the mill and have made out of the operation about $2200. logs are taken at the Old Town boom sawed by water and run here for about $2.50 per ?whether money can be made by it I do not know but presume they can, the advantages of the steam mill are that you can saw at all times of month and saw small lots of lumber to order at paying prices, The steamboat folks are preparing for the accommodation of the public next summer fares will probably be very low. petitions are now in circulation for five new boats, one of half a million -

Bangor June 12, 1853\nDu Quoin, July 5. 1853-\nBangor June 12 - 1853.\nIt is Sabbath day - bright, warm and still - not a sound, save the occasional buzzing of a fly, to be heard. Samuel and Jane have gone to meeting, Mrs. Griffith is up stairs, baby asleep on the lounge. - just at this juncture master \"P.P.\" woked up and demanded a luncheon, so my pen was laid aside, he is now laid back where he was before, kicking and fisting very energetically, his great eyes gazing about full of wonderment at all the strange things they behold. Now his father has come from meeting has taken him in his cap and they are having quite a conversation together, mostly carried on by the father however, with an occasional \"agoo\" from baby.

July 19, 1853.\nDear Brother & Sister\nWhile the darling sleeps I will try to write a little of a letter to know why we do not have one from you - The last we rec'd was dated the 13th of June, more

Are you sick Nettie, in the hot weather, and Isaac away, or are you both so glad and happy with your wee one that you cannot send your thoughts away so far as Maine? Hardly to blame if that be the case - \"A babe in a house is a well-spring of joy.\" Anna read all that good chapter two the next sabbath after our little one was given to us. Really we begin to feel anxious about you. I do hope to hear soon, and that you are all well. Am afraid if not actually sick, you are both suffering much from hot weather. I suppose we shall be obliged to do without letters more then we have done, for I know by experience that Nettie cannot find time now to do here part in that respect so well as formerly, and Isaac\nwritten up the left side:\nsee your baby and you could see mine - is Isaac a good hand to tend babies, Nettie? Or don't he have any time - Samuel is capital I think anybody that loves babies can tend them well - Do please write very soon and tell us his name.

Wish you had named him for Coigne, for oddity's sake, though I like Mayo well. Mother & Anna, Eliab & Maria left Bangor Thurs. the 25th of Aug. Eliab returned the following Monday.

For my own part, I am so astonished I don't know what to say. I jumped up and down in spite of my infirmities! Just think of it. What a queer termination of Anna's and Lizzie's arrangements about going to Chicago to teach - a couple of forlorn spinsters - both married and settled in life in the course of three weeks, both unthought of & unpremeditated, - sudden matches. I do hope they will prove happy ones. The burning of the school-house, Mrs. Hopkin's urgent invitation,  and all together, it seems to me we must look at it as all directed by the hand of Providence. For my part, I am so delighted I hardly know what to do with myself. I am so glad for Anna - and also truly glad for you that the town is to be to Illinois. Though we had a little hoped\n\nleft-hand side and top nothing more. I wish it might be all written off plainly, so as to be easily read, and carved in such sort that it can be presumed. I have done so much to it myself that I don't want to lose my labor! You and Anna must confer about it. Do write soon and often. Aff'y sister Lucy.

This rather alarmed us, for we thought it was still another ill turn, until we compared dates & found we had received letters with an account of the same illness, from you and Isaac, dated Jan. 3rd and 6th. Still we are far from feeling at rest about either of you.\n  Mother has really been trying to persuade Eliab to write immediately to Isaac for permission to go on to Illinois for the purpose of safely escorting you and \"Du Coign\" home to New England. Eliab seems very anxious about you. He says you ought to come immediately home to your Mother, and I think so too. Much as we should all want to have you here with us, I do not doubt that it would be better for you to be on those New Hampshire hills where you were born and bred, for a time until you had in part recovered your health & strength.\n  We are all worried about you. I want you should be packed off to New England forthwith. I am \"out of conceit\" that that most delightful Illinois climate, and feel very anxious to have you all\n\n[left-hand side and top] sometimes we have to coax him a long time to get him to open his bill at all, and when he does he will laugh, smack his lips, rub his feet together & make a great ado over a bit as big as a pea. Mother says she never saw a child that cared less about food. Do please write next time that you are gaining strength fast & have concluded to come East early in the spring. This is a sad-looking letter. Maria says she is really intending to write to you soon. I have not had a letter from Anna for a long time. Mother says \"tell them I think of them, love them and pray for them.\" Why don't Charles write to me? Love to him, as also to yourself. A kiss for baby. good night.

We were very sorry to learn, by Charles' letter, that you had not been so well again - I think I know how to sympathize with you in two particulars - viz. frequent absences of the dear husband, and backsliding in the matter of health; both which trials are great ones to me. It seems so hard when one, with great carefulness and patience, has just got nicely up, beginning to feel strength and vigor, and so hopeful of better days to come; to do a little too much, or take a little cold, and fall back to the old place again; yet, I know these are among the lesser trials, and should be considered so. O, how small compared with the lot of friends! There it is so\n[left side and on top]\nyou to speak of it. Mallie had sent to her, (received yesterday) two beautifully worked ottoman covers and a very handsome tidy. Did you ever know anybody have so many handsome presents?

There was a collision on the rail road - all the passengers escaped with slight injuries, but two or three cars of hogs and cattle were demolished. Two or three cars from the back end of another train had broken away,  without the Engineer's knowledge, so he had gone on & left them standing on the track. The man who was stationed on the back car with a lantern had lost his light & was unable to make his voice heard. It seems very wonderful that there was not more injury done. Charles was standing by the stove & the first thing he knew, he was lying flat on his back.

were being very, very good to write me such a nice little letter so soon.. It refreshed me in body and spirit. Isaac's authoritative preachment, too was duly appreciated, and will be faithfully obeyed. What a long, slim, lonesome day was Monday! It seemed as if there was nothing to do, and a great deal of time to do it! Percie missed Mayo, I think, very much, but hardly knew what the matter was, and so kept calling \"Papa\" every few minutes. I put him in bed alone Monday and last night: told him I was coming out to knit. He kissed me, snuggled down into bed as good as a kitten, called \"Mamma a a\" a few times (not complainingly at all) and in about ten minutes was sound asleep - did just so last night. I felt greatly releived for I expected an hour's cry the first\n\n[left-hand side and top]  - however, he is becoming very exemplary. Did not commit a single impropriety all day yesterday. Do please write often and persuade all the rest too. I want word from Mother now and then. Albina has not written for long, though perhaps 'tis my fault, as I have neglected writing to her. Very much love to all - not forgetting kisses for the little folks, a special allowance for the little Mayo. Lovingly, ever Sister Lucy.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95614,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95614","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/fe5771d8745c386db1c93fbd449c9cd0.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/fe5771d8745c386db1c93fbd449c9cd0.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/fe5771d8745c386db1c93fbd449c9cd0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fe5771d8745c386db1c93fbd449c9cd0.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:30:58+00:00","modified":"2020-07-10T21:42:14+00:00","filename":"fe5771d8745c386db1c93fbd449c9cd0.jpg","authentication":"b8343bca0d80da6edf7d00ad76d13fde","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_41_003_002_o2.jpg","size":1053012,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2259,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.043161182430771001528047037254509632475674152374267578125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["025050"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["025050"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["025050"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"fe5771d8745c386db1c93fbd449c9cd0.jpg","FileDateTime":1586654682,"FileSize":1053012,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2259\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2259,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 16:08:22","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:11 02:50:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:11 02:50:50","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1985,"ExifImageLength":3162,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1218,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1218","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"night.

It seems strange that Isaac should be so much affected by it.

Miss Pease is coming this week Wed. & Thurs. to make it. Mr. Charles Smith formerly of Milo, came in to tea with Samuel, & is to spend the night here. Sam'l Ely does not improve much if any. I wonder that his sisters are willing to have him about the store, as his conduct, or rather lack of conduct, is so noticable. He stands sometimes from one to two hours at a time with folded arms, looking at nothing, unless told to do something. Even strangers who come in sally him. What can be done for the poor fellow? Eliab went to Boston Thurs. Has not yet returned. Father Sawyer visited at Mr. Harlow's saturday. If I had felt smart, should have gone over, so as to say I had seen & spoken with a man one hundred years old. Percie had been more irritable & nervous for three weeks past than ever in his life before. He has had a very bad cold - almost influenza, since we came from Milo, which with his inflamed teeth, has been pretty hard for him. He is just getting over both now, I think. Don't fail to persuade Mother to send me her Alapine dress, unless she decides to come long enough before you do, to give time for some fixing. I got her a pr of gloves, and a collar, because I saw one so very cheap.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}]

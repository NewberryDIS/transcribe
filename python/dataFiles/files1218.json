I expect she misses the vegetables so fresh from the garden, the strawberries, which are abundant, the flowers & the children, but we'll try to make her comfortable as we can.

Dr Mc Ruen left me some new medicine about that time - don't know whether that gave me a start or not.

He recollects every particular of Josephs case - seemed to feel very much for him and to remember him with respect as a man.  He said his case and that of his son, were providences which it seemed very hard to understand.  His son, you know, imbibed animal poison nearly two years time and has been a great sufferer ever since.  Probably will not live long.  I have no doubt their opinions are correct as to the nature of my complaint, but I cannot feel that there is danger of such a result.

We have employed Dr Rick since Samuel was sick, as he was attending upon one it would not do very well to send for another.

I am reading Prescott's Ferdinand & Isabella.  Our trip to Deer Isle cost fifteen dollars, which amount in health or pleasure we think we did not receive.  I am tried & will finish letter tomorrow.\nSept. 10  It is tomorrow & I will finish my letter, ? I feel rather foolish and don't think of much to say.  We are, or rather have been, all engaged making a Lounge today-- Samuel says till Jim I am weak.  He is better today than yesterday, however, I cannot tell you much about Eliab- he is at Barris, and we think they mean to keep him there if possible.  Mary Monroe has been quite romantic lately in her ideas and actions-  She has given up Henry Starchfield, to whom she was engaged, and absconded by night, no body knew, or has yet been able to find out where, with Stephen Douglass. Somebody saw them in Waterville just getting into the cars. Poor girl! I pity her, His father feels very bad about it.  We should endeavor to answer your letter immediately after receiving them.  \nEveline Holman is here visiting our Girl Frances,she says she thinks from Alfred's letter that he don't like at Minnesota & that he says he shall come home in the Spring, if you want him with you write to him  But tell us so, how long you expect to stay there- I don't love to have you so far, far away\nGood Bye, affectionately, Sister Lucy","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95364,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/95364","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d68f3adf1974ded6fc1b1d526a32ed2e.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d68f3adf1974ded6fc1b1d526a32ed2e.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d68f3adf1974ded6fc1b1d526a32ed2e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d68f3adf1974ded6fc1b1d526a32ed2e.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:25:16+00:00","modified":"2020-07-08T02:19:57+00:00","filename":"d68f3adf1974ded6fc1b1d526a32ed2e.jpg","authentication":"d7aa782492eef0cfc65495be04061325","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_37_006_004_o2.jpg","size":1311452,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2876,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042222093442539},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["031920"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["031920"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["031920"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d68f3adf1974ded6fc1b1d526a32ed2e.jpg","FileDateTime":1586654670,"FileSize":1311452,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2876\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2876,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 10:27:03","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:08 03:19:20","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:08 03:19:20","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"SubSecTimeOriginal":95,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2962,"ExifImageLength":3707,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1218,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1218","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Ann sent me her Daguerreotype in a cunning little case, by Eliab -

What do you think of his studying Euclid? I am somewhat fearful That his love and aptness for Mathematics may lead him to attend to that branch, to the neglect of others. Mother will finish This I guess. I am ? fast. I really do a good deal of work. We rode out a few days before Sam'l went away had a lively, coltish horse, which got frightened, tipped us over. Threw me head over heels a rod or two, dragged Samuel farther, and hurt neither of us, only tore the crown off my bonnet! Eliab writes that his health is better - In haste good by Sis Lucy\nWhat a fuss Lute makes about Gen. Hodson, when there is nothing in it all worth repeating, much less worth writing. The Lawsuit you enquire about is nothing only the \"boy was dull & lazy, not trustworthy, moreover went away without letting C. know but what he was coming back again, he had paid him about what he thought he had earn'd, his father came after more pay, was Saucy, mad & unreasonable C wouldn't pay any more So Chase Sue'd him & it so turn'd out that rather than have a long lawsuit about such a trifle he did pay 7 or so dollars wholly in consequence of Lawyer Robinson's duplicity & downright dishonesty he is a very mean Rascal ---- when do you expect to come home --- what do you mean by --- that you are in want of a wife?

I have just been writing to Eliab, and before I put away my pen, will say a few words to you. \n               Your account of The preparation of food in Illinois was very interesting, certainly, - but it makes me feel bad to think that you are living in such a place. Why how can you stay there? Why don't you tell them how to cook? Won't they fix your part differently if you ask them to? I presume you have heard from Eliab, perhaps since I have - he has written home but once since he went away. Mother arrived here Nov. 20 - accompanied by James, Jane, Charlie and old Nelly - Quite a sleigh full to say nothing of trunks, boxes and budgets. James went home the next day. Charlie is to stay till his Father and Mother come after him, which we expect will be in a few days. He is a darling little fellow - active noisy and goodnatured. He has got a nice pair of boots uncle Samuel has made him a sled, and he is as big as any body - certainly a very manly boy for a \"three year old\". It is quite a change in the monotony of my life to have him frolicking about here. I seem to be progressing slowly in point of health - In accordance with Dr. Mc. Ruen's directions, I have had a sore blister on my back - he wishes two or three more - don't know as\n\n[left-hand side]Uncle Natty send Samuel in to borrow two dollars tonight.

I did so much want to go to Milo to Thanksgiving or sometime this winter, but shall have to give it up. I suppose. Charles and Albina are coming to make us a visit the first of sleighing. I suppose Samuel will go scaling again this winter. I wish he could get some other business. He has been surveying for a few days past. One surveyor has moved to Boston, and another licensed as The liquor seller of Bangor; so there is quite a scarcity of help, just as every body is in a hurry to get their lumber surveyed and vessels off before the river freezes. I tell Samuel he ought not to survey now a few days in the most uncomfortable part of the season just to accommodate, unless they will give him an appointment to survey next season. He is hoping now that they will. He is saving out lumber - has engaged a house frame, and a joiner to put up our house next summer. Is'nt that nice? Mr. Tebbets is to do all the joiner work for $400. \n\n                              Frances has been to our meeting & L.Y. all summer - She has been very much interested, and seems to be serious. Regrets to leave the Sabbath school - She is very ignorant particularly in regard to religious truth. She says she thinks Universalist parents do very wrong to neglect","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95378,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/95378","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c01b710ca4d81b8f48e2e04fb3abf137.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/c01b710ca4d81b8f48e2e04fb3abf137.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/c01b710ca4d81b8f48e2e04fb3abf137.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c01b710ca4d81b8f48e2e04fb3abf137.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:25:36+00:00","modified":"2020-07-08T02:45:59+00:00","filename":"c01b710ca4d81b8f48e2e04fb3abf137.jpg","authentication":"aa791730f4f87e34f45beb3bf44781f9","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_37_010_004_o2.jpg","size":1547455,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2867,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049976585409965},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["032120"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["032120"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180608"],"TimeCreated":["032120"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c01b710ca4d81b8f48e2e04fb3abf137.jpg","FileDateTime":1586654670,"FileSize":1547455,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2867\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2867,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 10:27:32","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:08 03:21:20","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:08 03:21:20","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2959,"ExifImageLength":3715,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1218,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1218","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"their children as they do.

I wish you could have heard him in his peculiar way, \"Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer.\" He & Mr. Lesley talked that the Report was on which common people can not understand, whereas men of their talents & learning ought to know enough to write so as to be intelligible to all. &c.&c.&c. They vexed some of the good people as did Thomas, Mr. Willard &c. with their abolition talk. In the P.M. Mr. Drake from Garland, preached an excellent sermon. Evening, Mr. Parker. Excellent of course. Charles went to Bangor last week, carried his hog, got .07 for 1\/2, and 6 1\/2 for 1\/2. Hog a year old weighed 360 lbs. Very good they said. Had to pay proceeds right away for provisions & pay Almeda borrowed money. This week Wednes & Thurs. he went to Lincoln with 36 bu. of oats, tandem team, Nelly & Donk, worked admirably; got .50 per bu. At Bangor only, .40 cts. Paid it on his way home to Rollins the Publican. Is going with another load soon. Hope he'll be able to furnish you some money out of oats or hay. Rollins was at Richmand & neighboring towns recently. Did'nt know you was there. Was sorry. Would have called. Said 'twas very sickly about then. Small pox at Canaan. There has been one case & some say more in Bangor. People got excited & accounts are exagerated.  Seems to me, however, there is some reason for alarm. People at least ought to be vaccinated.

Am glad you'll write to [unclear] Hills folks dislike him much and you know are always rather heartless. His school is only a fortnight longer. Harvey, teaching in Brownville, enters the Medical School at Brunswick in Spring. Barker calls him one of the finest fellows in the world. If so, scrape acquaintance. John Barker died a few days ago. Was unwell, quite, went with his brother to Ellsworth, grew worse, started for home and died on the way.

C. went down and settled all up with Everett, who threw in 12.50 of his account, gave him his note for 3000 to be paid next Sept. He gets back the Brownville lumber, Rider money & Hamlen money.

Why is it:? We have thought of every possible reason, and worried ourselves with many \"what ifs\". It was Thanksgiving day when your last letter was started, Nov. 27. Christmas and New Years have come and gone since then, and in our hearts we wished you all joy & happiness, though we did not write it. I have written once since receiving your last. Mother fears you are sick, too sick to write, but I tell her if you were sick you would certainly have some one else write. I can think of no reason except that the mails may be more irregular in winter, on account of bad travelling. I shall send this today, hopping however to get a letter from you tonight. Samuel has been at home once, is now gone again. His new Pony works nicely. We had a nice New Years letter from Anna last night.

We had begun to fear that all sorts of evils had lighted? on you, and we now are thinking that it is high time for us to hear from you again. It was almost a month between your last and the previous one we think these must have been on lost.\nIt is a bright, beautiful day, though rather cold, I believe. People say we have had a very severe winter continued cold weather and an unusual number of severe storms. I can say very little about it from experience, as I have kept housed most of the time. Samuel came home a week ago, after a fortnight absence. went away again last Monday to be gone three weeks. This route is nearly the same as last winter, I believe. I am hoping to go to Milo while he is out next time if he can spare time. My health is improving fast I think. I have been steadily growing better, without having any pull backs, for several weeks.

April 21. 1852\nBangor March 22, 1852\nDear Brother Isaac\nYour last letter was received a few days since - we have been waiting, hoping to receive another letter from Eliab before writing. Perhaps you have heard from him, however, more and oftener than we have. About a week since we received a lot dated as North Hampton Water Cure. He has put himself under the care of Dr. Munde. He wrote himself, but wrote in bed . as usual he expressed himself very indefinitely- did not tell whether he was much worse or not. We feel very anxious about him - more so if possible than we should if we knew he was very sick, and he had told us all about it. We are confidently expecting a letter today from him. He does wrong - so does any one when away from home, and not well, not to tell exactly how he is. I feel very anxious about him. I fear he has been ambitious and studied to hard. I think if he had gone to school with no desire and consequently made no effort to distinguish himself, but merely to pass way the time, so as not to get uneasy as he would certainly very soon do without any employment, it might have been conducive to his health & happiness. That course, however, would probably be a difficult one for him perhaps for any of us.\nWe feel disappointed as your not coming\n$25. I have not mentioned it before.

The substance of the matter is, he wants to be an Engineer, but don't know how to begin. One Mr. Deane of Winthrop teaches Engineering, but asks eight dollars a year tuition and $2 per week board, which makes it rather expensive. William has a natural turn for Mathematics & has paid considerable attention to it. Understands the theory of Surveying well to. He is tall awkward, bashful, green- taught school successfully last winter. Is determined to settle in the western states somewhere. His father wishes to know if you would be willing to take him with you, and teach and help him along as you can. He will pay you what is right for your trouble- he will go right on any time you would wish.

How I wanted to go and\nhear it, but I solace myself instead by writing a bit to you - you are \nboth very good to write so please continue - to close\nmothers bookmark is a perfect beauty.  I never seen\none so handsome.  She will write soon.  Lizzie is spending\na few days here.  I must not write longer tonight.  With much love.\nSister Lucy.

of your domestic happiness, but you just wait about five years and you will then probably say that you were not wise in thinking yourselves as happy as any other people when you were enjoying your first years happiness. You and Nettie really seem to think you are throwing all this in the shade in in the matter of real solid enjoyment. Well I do not wish to quarrell with you about the matter.

July 19, 1853.\nDear Brother & Sister\nWhile the darling sleeps I will try to write a little of a letter to know why we do not have one from you - The last we rec'd was dated the 13th of June, more than a month since - we have been anxiously expecting one for many days. Are you sick Nettie, in the hot weather, and Isaac away, or are you both so glad and happy with your wee one that you cannot send your thoughts away so far as Maine? Hardly to blame if that be the case - \"A babe in a house is a well-spring of joy.\" Anna read all that good chapter two the next sabbath after our little one was given to us. Really we begin to feel anxious about you. I do hope to hear soon, and that you are all well. Am afraid if not actually sick, you are both suffering much from hot weather. I suppose we shall be obliged to do without letters more then we have done, for I know by experience that Nettie cannot find time now to do here part in that respect so well as formerly, and Isaac\nwritten up the left side:\nsee your baby and you could see mine - is Isaac a good hand to tend babies, Nettie?

Eliab seems very anxious about you. He says you ought to come immediately home to your Mother, and I think so too. Much as we should all want to have you here with us, I do not doubt that it would be better for you to be on those New Hampshire hills where you were born and bred, for a time until you had in part recovered your health & strength.\n  We are all worried about you.

What is money, what are railroads, what are townships of land, compared with health? It seems to me that you are all losing your health and vigor and strength of constitution, and I wish Isaac would arrange his business so that he can leave, and come away. I think he had better send his wife and boy by express, and follow on himself as soon as he settle up matters so as to leave. I am quite uneasy to have Charles out there, and want he should without fail start for home before the hot, debilitating summer weather approaches. I do sympathize with you in your sorrow and disappointment at being obliged to wean the baby. I know it was hard for your feelings, though perhaps easier for the little one, than it would be after getting older and more attached to his dinners! I am intending to wean Percie in April. I dread it, both on his account and my own. 'Tis a comfort to nurse him, and he takes so much comfort in it, it seems hard to deprive him of it. He is quite well now.

I have worried myself a good deal because it seemed to me that Nettie could not enjoy her visit here in the midst of so much confusion; Changing help, having no help etc. etc. I never had such a time of weariness and discouragement before - one day Samuel went after eleven different girls without being able to get one.

You see we are all of one mind in regard to it. Samuel thinks it would have been better, decidedly, if he had come home last spring. If, on account of health, you think best not to come till spring, it seems to me that Albina had better take Josie & Mary to her Father's and stay there, let Charlie come here, and let Walter and Sally, on some terms have the house, and take care of the things.

Such a month has hardly ever been known. Elia wrote you that we have had a few cases of cholera, but there is a difference of opinion about it. The papers contradict all such statements. It will be almost strange if we do not have something of it here, though now it is not sickly, except among children.

They have a very nice plump little babe- no name decided on yet.

Two or three cars from the back end of another train had broken away,  without the Engineer's knowledge, so he had gone on & left them standing on the track.

were being very, very good to write me such a nice little letter so soon.. It refreshed me in body and spirit. Isaac's authoritative preachment, too was duly appreciated, and will be faithfully obeyed. What a long, slim, lonesome day was Monday! It seemed as if there was nothing to do, and a great deal of time to do it! Percie missed Mayo, I think, very much, but hardly knew what the matter was, and so kept calling \"Papa\" every few minutes. I put him in bed alone Monday and last night: told him I was coming out to knit. He kissed me, snuggled down into bed as good as a kitten, called \"Mamma a a\" a few times (not complainingly at all) and in about ten minutes was sound asleep - did just so last night. I felt greatly releived for I expected an hour's cry the first\n\n[left-hand side and top]  - however, he is becoming very exemplary. Did not commit a single impropriety all day yesterday.

I hope she will have the good sense - not a feeling of inferiority - to step out when I have callers & company, for her own sake, as they and I should think so much more of her judgment if she should!","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95646,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/95646","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/717e3c233b8d607456f8b0bd23ee20ad.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/717e3c233b8d607456f8b0bd23ee20ad.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/717e3c233b8d607456f8b0bd23ee20ad.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/717e3c233b8d607456f8b0bd23ee20ad.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:31:40+00:00","modified":"2020-07-11T17:57:36+00:00","filename":"717e3c233b8d607456f8b0bd23ee20ad.jpg","authentication":"9145ce4eb1c83d8fe59a0275e27e295e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_02_fl_41_010_002_o2.jpg","size":1223351,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2356,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048078625102182},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["025451"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["025451"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180611"],"TimeCreated":["025451"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 2"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"717e3c233b8d607456f8b0bd23ee20ad.jpg","FileDateTime":1586654683,"FileSize":1223351,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2356\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2356,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"13mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:11 16:09:28","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:11 02:54:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:11 02:54:51","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2082,"ExifImageLength":3180,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1218,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1218","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"And what pleasure can it give her to be present with entire strangers, who care nothing for her, I cannot imagine.

Miss Pease is coming this week Wed. & Thurs. to make it. Mr. Charles Smith formerly of Milo, came in to tea with Samuel, & is to spend the night here. Sam'l Ely does not improve much if any. I wonder that his sisters are willing to have him about the store, as his conduct, or rather lack of conduct, is so noticable. He stands sometimes from one to two hours at a time with folded arms, looking at nothing, unless told to do something. Even strangers who come in sally him. What can be done for the poor fellow? Eliab went to Boston Thurs. Has not yet returned. Father Sawyer visited at Mr. Harlow's saturday. If I had felt smart, should have gone over, so as to say I had seen & spoken with a man one hundred years old. Percie had been more irritable & nervous for three weeks past than ever in his life before. He has had a very bad cold - almost influenza, since we came from Milo, which with his inflamed teeth, has been pretty hard for him. He is just getting over both now, I think. Don't fail to persuade Mother to send me her Alapine dress, unless she decides to come long enough before you do, to give time for some fixing.

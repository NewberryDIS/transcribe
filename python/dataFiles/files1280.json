There is no benefit of the breeze in the city--and that you know is the principal thing we live upon in the Prairie. The nights too seem still hotter than the days. Why I could hardly sleep at all the two nights I was in St Louis. And then the Misquitoes, are certainly worse there in the city of St Louis than I have seen them any where else at the west. No one can sleep without Misquito Bars? -- and those you know I dislike  At Carlyle, stopping there to look after Lumber, Casting and other freight coming in for the R.R.

Would it not be a good plan for both of us?\nOh My Dearest Wife Ettie, who will you not send me a really good Daguerrotype picture of your own nice little Self--about a V worth at least--perhaps a full length--in a light frame or case to send by mail. Do Ettie--Come, I would give more than that to please my Ettie--and you need not grudge just a V or X worth to send to me.\nCharles has hardly decided yet when to return East. Colling Dunham has left the Road & gone home East. Oh Ettie! How like a heathen I do live here--only to think of it here ever since the 2d week in June most three months--I believe I have heard but one single sermon preached--That is all the has been preached at Duquoin except by Methodists. To be sure I have been obliged to read some sermons myself Now - think of it--how I do need an Ettie to take care of me I am getting still more careless about going to Meeting keep me good--I do not know but I ought to have gone down to Meeting today.--but then I was tired & sleepy and did not feel a bit like Reading a long hard sermon to unclear.

You know it was supposed that R.B. Mason had lost very heavily by the failure & depletion? of Robert Schuyler. He supposed so himself--until he went east this Summer; When he found in Robert Schuyler's Safe a package marked \"Private Papers of R.B. Mason\"--sealed up which was found to contain fifty or sixty thousand dollars in R.R. Stocks & Bonds (Mr. Mason's property deposited with or loaned to Schuyler and which he supposed gone) and a note to Mr Mason saying that whatever he had been guilty of towards others, he would try to be just to Mr Mason. Now isn't that worth while? It really did me good. Just think how hard it would have been, if he had been as expected ruined by his best friend, his whole property lost, and at his age to begin the work as it were anew--with his large family--a very expensive family, and with their habits of expense formed--that is a great thing. For you & I now the loss or gain of property is a slight affair. We can do without it and not hurt us--But say 20 years hence if we should live with a family around us, living in luxury, and habits all formed and fixed--the loss of property then is a dreadful thing.

Perhaps though I can find One, Aspen? the German foreman is here, and he a French scholar--perhaps he has one. I guess though I shall go to the Camp Meeting this afternoon. I will write again when I get time. I fear this isn't a very good Sunday letter. Much love to Father & Mother, who I suppose have now returned and all. Write to me all about everything--Most truly\nIsaac S.M.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102517,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102517","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/4702cbbbd2f39fb3290c4ee31e183a9a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/4702cbbbd2f39fb3290c4ee31e183a9a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/4702cbbbd2f39fb3290c4ee31e183a9a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4702cbbbd2f39fb3290c4ee31e183a9a.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:55:38+00:00","modified":"2020-09-04T17:46:00+00:00","filename":"4702cbbbd2f39fb3290c4ee31e183a9a.jpg","authentication":"48a004907f80145936df4b1d1d229347","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_176_017_001_o2.jpg","size":1855684,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2817,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.060994885549376},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231641"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231641"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231641"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4702cbbbd2f39fb3290c4ee31e183a9a.jpg","FileDateTime":1595807715,"FileSize":1855684,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2817\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2817,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:32:57","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:16:41","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:16:41","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3293,"ExifImageLength":4208,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1280,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1280","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"[Isaac, Ducoign Sept;7.1854\nDunbarton Sept. 16, 1854}\nDucoign Perry Co.

One of them however I received before I wrote to you last but did not have it with me when I wrote I went to Centralia on Saturday last with Col. Mason and Presdt Burrall, and remaining there over Sunday wrote a lot of letters to you, & sent to St Louis Monday Morning. Sunday, after visiting that Cellar I went off to a Camp Meeting. Meth. Epis. on Fulton Creek, 3 or 4 miles from Centralia. It did not amount to much--had comparatively few present on account of the Drouth, etc etc. (They were hauling water to drink about two miles) No feed etc. I heard an ignorant fellow (old Sub Contractor on R.R. \"preach a funeral\" for a child which died last spring\". Very worthless afterwards some remarks by the Elder, which were better. Then the Communion--but somehow the receiving the sacrament kneeling, as the Methodists do. (East that is not essential, but here it is the rule) does not suit me. It has a savor of priesthood about it. I should think the officiating officer Bishop rather than Elder. The Camp Meeting--was a bit of pulpit of rough sticks boards under a tree with flatted logs ranged around and all about the Tent--some of the Big Wagons of the country with their cloth covers--Morey's? wagons some wooden camps like those you saw at Peter Hagler's meeting house--some tents made of Bed blankets, or only cotton cloth & sheets &c.&tc.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102518,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102518","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/e25061b45dff1b4083282be55bbb5881.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/e25061b45dff1b4083282be55bbb5881.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/e25061b45dff1b4083282be55bbb5881.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e25061b45dff1b4083282be55bbb5881.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:55:39+00:00","modified":"2020-09-04T17:49:03+00:00","filename":"e25061b45dff1b4083282be55bbb5881.jpg","authentication":"8da2394c507f0a149ee631491de3eed4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_176_017_002_o2.jpg","size":1667837,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2788,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.055390728784739},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231653"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231653"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231653"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e25061b45dff1b4083282be55bbb5881.jpg","FileDateTime":1595807715,"FileSize":1667837,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2788\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2788,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:32:59","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:16:53","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:16:53","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3286,"ExifImageLength":4243,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1280,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1280","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I staid at the Camp Meeting till about sunset (It was to be kept up that evening and two days longer) Then rode on to Little Muddy 25 or 30 miles.

The sun rises up into the sky blazing in Majesty, and the broad prairie is resplendent in its glare. Far on the western horizon are various bits of straggling irregular clouds, like the scattered squadrons of a vanquished army, and, even while watched, fast disappearing in their eager flight. The sun does certainly look like a mighty conqueror. (Maybe partly on account of our personal experience of his prowess) But this morning his rays are simply glorious, not destructive. Probably, his enemies being conquered & driven away, he is just now good natured--possibly magnanimous. Yesterday was full of clouds; with gusty wins and threatened rain. But Old Sol has fairly triumphed once more, and the only result is a cooler not a dryer atmosphere. This morning the Thermometer is down to 72 degree symbol F. and I presume many are complaining of cold. Yesterday it was 98 {degree symbol} F. in the shade The day before 100 {degree symbol} F. or more. and 97 [degree symbol} only just before sunset. It is astonishing how the hot dry weather does continue here. There has even yet been no rain to even begin to moisten the earth. I have been very busy for two or three weeks past, rather unusually so: There is quite a pile of unanswered letters lying before me; from Mother, Lucy, Eliab, Maria. Anne I have not got any letter from. To my dearest, my wife I have written since receiving any letter from her; though her last letters are really unanswered. I wrote last Sunday from Centralia. and again in the midst of the busy week, but I guess without replying to previous letters--and I am sure I cannot now tell what I wrote.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102521,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102521","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/599ab0b346060a2c20f860d96fab7053.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/599ab0b346060a2c20f860d96fab7053.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/599ab0b346060a2c20f860d96fab7053.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/599ab0b346060a2c20f860d96fab7053.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:55:43+00:00","modified":"2020-09-03T22:02:43+00:00","filename":"599ab0b346060a2c20f860d96fab7053.jpg","authentication":"449d9d3c1621a598ff398183cdea3bec","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_176_018_002_o2.jpg","size":1747672,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2802,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057752134718587},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231720"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231720"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["231720"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"599ab0b346060a2c20f860d96fab7053.jpg","FileDateTime":1595807715,"FileSize":1747672,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2802\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2802,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:33:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:17:20","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:17:20","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3292,"ExifImageLength":4229,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1280,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1280","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"You ask, Ettie, about Abby Wilson.

But, as I wrote before, think it all over, and decide understandingly that you want to come out this Fall; and I will surely find some way to get you out here, as soon as it is prudent to do so. It would not be strange after the long drouth & extreme heat of the summer if the Fall should be a very sickly one. In fact it is now already I expect in many places. There is very much more sickness than there was last year. At Little Muddy you know it was quite healthy last year. Now most of the men have got away from there--but very many of those who are left there are complaining. But we will see how it becomes, & I will try to find a good place for you at Centralia perhaps; when the sickness abates. I am sorry about your Mother's anxiety & nervousness. What about Jenny?

I ought to have sent you some more before now. However this is worth more than X or XX to me.\nIt seems the letters are not all regular exactly--if they all arrive at last. The sometimes get misplaced in their order. Yours I believe have never come to me so, the last first; but they are sometimes delayed and two come together. You wonder Saturday night whether Charles is with me. He always is. Always in this little office out of work hours--seated in one of the high stools at the big table just behind my back as I sit at my desk. He has his bed fixed up up stairs; and lives as well as work in this building; going out only to his meals. You wonder whether I read, write, or think. Well some considerable of both each. If I have but just come in on Saturday night I have various letters, statements & reports to read; and not a little to write in arranging & finishing up the week's work. Of course too there is some thinking about tit all. --and when it is through with--I am very apt to be tired--as business man ought to be--and go to bed straight away.

Your mailing letters on Tuesday instead\nof Thursday I think will make, an improvement.\nMy letters seem to reach you in \"batches\" - four in one\nweek!  Only half baked ones I guess mostly.\nI write regularly every Sunday you know:  and \nhave once or twice written something between times.\nOh Ettie, I am so glad of that Daguereotype - my own\nnice sweet Ettie:  It does me good every time I\nlook at it, which is - sometimes.  That face and the\nlittle me:  are my treasures.  I am rejoiced that you\nhave had rain.  I presume there has been rain most\nevery where through the country before this.  In this\nregion the rain has not been extended yet; or at\nleast, not every where.  It has seemed to come\nin strips & occasionally.  There was some good rains\ntwo weeks or more since in some places within 50\nmiles; but not a drop here really until last Tuesday\nThen it rained finely just here for five or six hours; but\nthere was hardly any only six or eight miles north.\nAlmost none at Mt Hawkins.\nYou say Mayo likes some people at first sight; while he will\nhave nothing to do with others.

So our work was very pressing for the one engine. However at 4 P.M. we were in order and started to commence our day's work. Mitchell & I both came up here to Ducoign on the Train. As it was a night Train great care requisi?te & absolutely necessary to be back to the River to load again before 7 the next Morning to bring up Mr Mason & his party. One or more of us would keep with the Train. I had intended to go up myself leaving Mitchell to sleep till the Train came along back: but I hardly know how it went differently, from some impulse of Mitchell's I believe, for I certainly wanted & intended to go up. But I did stay & Mitchell went on with the Train. It was then just dark.

It was doubtless within 10 minutes from the time it left this station. I was soon there with lights and help  Dr Ray who lives here & other Drs sent for. Mitchell and the Men on the Engine (who were not seriously hurt) had already removed the wounded. There were 15 men on the Train. All were more or less jarred & shocked. 5 picked themselves up and went off, these were laboring men. Two others were knocked senseless but removed to a house, and soon got over it, are really unhurt  There were three on the Engine. Our Engineer & fireman jumped off and were uninjured. The other Engineman & Machiner's from the 1st Div. staid on the Engine to the last, was jammed up against the Firebox & bruised a little. It is a wonder he was not killed. If he had jumped off on the side he was on he must have been killed, though that would have been called his chance for safety. By neglecting it he was saved.

Sent off for coroner & magistrates, and for the friends\nof one of the men who lived 15 miles north and for Thos Taylor's family got the wounded\ntaken care of.  Charles to stay in charge of the bodies on the cabin.  The\nCarpenters at work making Coffins; tried to get Mitchell to bed\nand then started for the River.  Had to walk several miles before\nI could get a hand car.  At De Soto found a Brother of one of the dead.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102555,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102555","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/98b92c4c5999068d4c707fae71687389.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/98b92c4c5999068d4c707fae71687389.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/98b92c4c5999068d4c707fae71687389.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/98b92c4c5999068d4c707fae71687389.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:56:26+00:00","modified":"2020-09-03T22:02:44+00:00","filename":"98b92c4c5999068d4c707fae71687389.jpg","authentication":"d8b6704382395a93d43df5d4657f909b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_176_025_004_o2.jpg","size":1937048,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2816,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.063691866582492},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["232104"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["232104"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["232104"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"98b92c4c5999068d4c707fae71687389.jpg","FileDateTime":1595807717,"FileSize":1937048,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2816\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2816,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:34:51","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:21:04","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:21:04","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":63,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3298,"ExifImageLength":4215,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1280,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1280","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"They were two Brothers Austin & Aeahel Root who came out here a month\nor two since from Vermont 18 & 21 years old, the younger went to work\nat the bridge but took sick & has been unable to work most of the time\nwith Dysentery.  The older worked at the tracklaying, very steady one of\nthe very best men.  Thursday his brother sent to him to come down\nand see him.  He went intending to stay a day or two but finding the\ntrain going up at dusk suddenly concluded to go up - and was\nkilled.  How I pitied that boy, left alone here so far from home - entirely\ndestitute and sick.  I feared he would really break his heart.  But\nI have got him up here & believe he is better, I will take care of him.\nI got to the river before Mr Mason arrived from below.  Met him\nthere with the dreadful news.  Took every measure to urge\nforward the completion of the bridge - so we can get Engines &\ncars over from the 1st Div.  Then came up with Misters Mason Olson\n& Griswold with much effort succeeded in getting them through\nto the end of track by 12PM so they could go on.  I got back to the\nwreck, where Mr Mitchell was already at work clearing away\nthe fragments with a large force of men.  The wreck is a complete\none.  Our great 10.000 engine as perfectly used up as I ever saw one,\nlaying lead downwards in the ditch; the machinery fairly raked and\nFour Cars entirely destroyed.  The dead were buried at DuQuoin \nOld burying ground on Friday afternoon.  Austin A. Root,\nHarding Keating, Jacob Randleman; all young stout\nmen, 20 to 25 years old, healthy & active; on the same car they\nwere on were four oldish men rather weak & aguish looking\nwho were all saved.  Friday night I got down here & by 9 slept.\nI had been on my feet from 5am Thursday.  In the night\nFriday, by great good fortune, Goodale got back from St Louis with\nthe repaired cylinder heads of the old Medford.  They went to work\non her & got her running before night Sat.  Mitchell & his men\nsucceeded in clearing the wreck & track.  I took all the force\nI could muster to the River, worked there all day & got back\ntired at 10 P.M to hear then of Taylor's death. got men at work\non coffin &c  But I finally got to sleep & slept till almost 10 this\nmorning.  Mitchell got the Medford started at 4 P.M up\nto End of Track, came back this morning & has gone up now\n3.30 P.M with another load.  I regret the Sabbath work but it seems\nunavoidable.  The whole country is waiting for us 1000.00 would\nnot pay for the delay of a day now unless the Medford worked today.\nThe whole line must stop tomorrow.  The Engine working today\nall can get to work tomorrow.  I never did order Sunday work.\nThat I could not prevent I did order not to work today at the bridge\nwhich was taking a great responsibility - if the rain had not taken the responsibility.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102556,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102556","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7010d0a5868f7a019edd0453aac52fe6.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7010d0a5868f7a019edd0453aac52fe6.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7010d0a5868f7a019edd0453aac52fe6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7010d0a5868f7a019edd0453aac52fe6.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:56:27+00:00","modified":"2020-09-03T22:02:44+00:00","filename":"7010d0a5868f7a019edd0453aac52fe6.jpg","authentication":"810e7388add26f45e6212f8daa227478","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_176_026_001_o2.jpg","size":1728414,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

Thursday morning\nI went up to Centralia, and only returned from there on last night\nMr Mason, with Mr Watson &c and Mr M Brayman Solicitor & money for ILL\nCentral R.R also, came down with me: but did not stop here.  All\ngoing down to Jonesboro to spend Sabbath.  Will probably be back here\non Monday sometimes.  Saturday it began to be cold again\nand this morning everything every thing is frozen up as hard\nas you please.  It was not very early when I got up & had my\nbreakfast this morning.  And then I found it so cold in office that I took\nmy writing materials and came over here to the boarding house,\nand sit here by the coal fire to write.  The room is not very large, but\ntolerably well filled.  There are 10 or 12 boarders who are pretty likely\nto be around the fire on a morning like this.  Then the family is not\ninconsiderable, and when the work is done up they are glad to come in\nto sit in this room.  Perhaps I had better introduce you to the family.\nI hardly know where to begin - Mrs Fulton is undeniably the head\nin the kitchen:  and a very good one too.  Mrs Caroline McCoy is\nprobably the head in the dining room.  General Assistants, Sarah\nand Josephine Fulton.  Plaything for every body Mrs McCoy's little baby,\nnow just beginning to go alone.  Usually on the way, Mrs Fultons\ntwo or three boys; though I believe the oldest John divides with \nthe Blacksmith Jos.

Did I not write to you the result of the Carlee B Reyes trial?\nThe verdict, although a mixed one, various points being\nconsidered, and variously decided, was in favor of Mr Reyes: avoiding\nto Curlee less than Mr Reyes had offered him a year before.  Besides\nthat the interest was not allowed, which was a loss to Curleee of some\n70 or 80 dolls.  You say you felt cross having a canker sore\nin your mouth.  I do not believe it, that is the crossest it\nwas all in your imagination.  I have plagued you, and dared you to\nit enough to know.  Being cross is an exploit of which you are entirely\nincapable.  You had better \"meekly\" give up all pretentions to it.\nYou would I know if you could hear me snub some of these luckeys,\noccasionally , so as to know by observation what Cross is.  I am\nvery sorry for the canker though.  Hope it is all well.  I am afraid\nyou and Mother do too much work, & get tired.  Why do you have\na cold?  Be careful - Hire some help in the house, if you need\nit in the least.  Getting home here last night, I found letters\nfrom Bangor, Samuel, Eliah & Lucy.

Eliah\n& Maria comfortably housekeeping & all well.  Eliah & Samuel wrote\nvery fully of their business.  They have got along much better than\ncould have been expected.

I suppose George came home with you, and you are now having a nice pleasant time together. I wish I were there too. Never mind, I expect to be by and by. Yes, and then will not some of us be glad! Will Little Mayo be afraid of me? He would, I expect if I should come home with the whiskers! By the way, I have not been to St Louis lately, [[Gisen?] (who you know was our Barber) has been sick, and all busy; and the beard & Moustache has all grown rather long.

Perhaps though he will send it in to Pittsburg to me. After this trifling 'Episode'  I took the cars and rode 55 miles among the Mountains & the Juniata River River - through some of the mountains in fact, to Tyrone among or under the Bald Eagle Mountains  The day before the Blue Ridge Mountains were all green of various shades. These today, nearer the Alleghanies, are only green partly; Much of the say being only Limestone, either  great perpendicular cliffs & edges, or immense piles & slopes of  the fragments thereof.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102579,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102579","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/57ce44fa7e09edee29f4860743f05d9f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/57ce44fa7e09edee29f4860743f05d9f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/57ce44fa7e09edee29f4860743f05d9f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/57ce44fa7e09edee29f4860743f05d9f.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:57:01+00:00","modified":"2020-09-03T22:02:44+00:00","filename":"57ce44fa7e09edee29f4860743f05d9f.jpg","authentication":"6f2f671fe90c1611e84c3bf6520369a8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_177_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1815693,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2825,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.059511406096362},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["233017"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["233017"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["233017"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"57ce44fa7e09edee29f4860743f05d9f.jpg","FileDateTime":1595807718,"FileSize":1815693,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2825\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2825,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:36:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:30:17","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:30:17","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3337,"ExifImageLength":4252,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1280,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1280","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"At Tyrone at 8 oclock I took Stage and about 12 or 13 hours pretty steady riding to reach this point 42 miles or perhaps only 40.

There is also a little Baptist\nMeeting house here, but no meeting in either.\nI should hardly know what to do, if i had not here\na little pocket Testament that Ettie gave me.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102581,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102581","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/baed572e428dbaf4162d1a922a718586.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/baed572e428dbaf4162d1a922a718586.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/baed572e428dbaf4162d1a922a718586.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/baed572e428dbaf4162d1a922a718586.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:57:04+00:00","modified":"2020-09-03T22:02:44+00:00","filename":"baed572e428dbaf4162d1a922a718586.jpg","authentication":"d56d1285f4da3c662613a86e944b364b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_177_002_004_o2.jpg","size":1506757,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2840,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049124836984872},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["233024"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["233024"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["233024"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"baed572e428dbaf4162d1a922a718586.jpg","FileDateTime":1595807718,"FileSize":1506757,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2840\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2840,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:36:41","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:30:24","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:30:24","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":68,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3330,"ExifImageLength":4221,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1280,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1280","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I may get tired of staying here, and the noise\nof the adjacent Bar room, where the Maine Liquor\nLaw does not seem to have reached; and\nconclude this afternoon to take to the mountains,\nand walk towards the next town.\nOh Ettie - how much I have wanted another\npair of eyes to see these mountains and everything\nwith for two days past.

But on the other hand, I want to hear from my Ettie & Mayo, and when I get to Pittsburgh tomorrow night or Saturday morning, the temptation may be too strong for me to go to Elyria to stay over Sunday, and find a letter or two there.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102588,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102588","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b4c03de36db6f373a341cffd5c42ad47.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b4c03de36db6f373a341cffd5c42ad47.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b4c03de36db6f373a341cffd5c42ad47.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b4c03de36db6f373a341cffd5c42ad47.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:57:14+00:00","modified":"2020-09-03T22:02:44+00:00","filename":"b4c03de36db6f373a341cffd5c42ad47.jpg","authentication":"e1e8f0cd9faa9dc543bbdd1f66dac763","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_177_004_003_o2.jpg","size":1671411,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2807,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.055133693543918},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["233114"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["233114"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["233114"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b4c03de36db6f373a341cffd5c42ad47.jpg","FileDateTime":1595807719,"FileSize":1671411,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2807\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2807,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:37:10","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:31:14","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:31:14","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3292,"ExifImageLength":4222,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1280,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1280","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Well I do not know what more I have to write.

It was really but little that we had when we were wed. --little but true hearts and skilful hands. And now I suppose we have what then we might perhaps have considered a competence. The prospects of this DuQuoin property are I think better & better. It is true, on account of the hard times, there has been little sold, and less realised of late. But I would not now dispose of my interest in it for $5000.00. This coal business must rapidly bring it forward. On one 40 acres of it we have sold about 2\/3 of the lots, for some $3000.00 of which I have received some and shall about $1000.00 more this fall. The other third will probably bring us $1000.00 each additional. Then there is 360 acres of land yet untouched. For the least valuable parts of this we are now getting $20.00 per acre. Some of it does not lack offers indeed at $50.00 per acre. So it cannot well net me less than $5000.00 or more and may perhaps $10.000.00. Besides all this you know I have out here 480 acres of land in other places, for some of which I could now get $10. per acre, and which may probably in a few years all bring that price. Then you know I have most $4000.00 at Bangor.

He is just leaving now & probably will accept the H.M. Soc. Agency, in which case he will not return in Sept. It was also Communion this afternoon.\nWhen I went down before I did not go near the old place. Today noon I did, and hardly knew whether to laugh or cry. Inside it is simply a deserted house, and does not look much more than when I returned there last Summer, and found no Ettie there. But around the house! The Gardens , why you could not crowd your way through it. Weeds & every thing else, as thick as a mat six feet high all over it. A perfect tangle, flowers, vegetables & weeds just as thick as they can stand, in that rich soil striving for preeminence. You remember a little row of peach sprouts across the bottom of the garden two or three feet high maybe. They were never transplanted and there they stand close together, but Trees, 15 or 20 ft. high & covered with peaches! That great pear tree south of the house is as tall & vigorous as ever, but is hardly to be seen; it is only one mighty pyramid of grape vine, & well covered with largest of clusters. The way to the 'Cape of Good Rope?' is entirely blocked up with weeds & boughs. All round the house it is the same. Every window is shut up by thickest curtain of leaves. The Rose bushes are most mighty & multitudinous, but a perfect snarl with every thing else. The Trumpet Honeysuckles cover the roofs in their gorgeous pride.

Arriving here I was rejoiced with your letter, that of Jan. 3d written & sent only the day after we started, and which arrived here I believe they say on Monday last. I suppose it made the journey before the great storms, and nothing has gotten through the mighty blockade since till now. I trust you have written several times, and that a number of letters are one the way: and I hope will reach here tonight. \nIt seemed good I assure you to get a letter from you written only even one day after I left there, to know that the little one's mouth were better, and how you all got along the first night; but I am still anxious enough to hear later new from you all. I know you have written, and I think letters will come to hand tonight. \nWe did have rather a long and somewhat tiresome delay at Buffalo, from Tuesday till Friday. However we were pretty comfortably situated at the Hotel. For three whole days there was no Train got through the snow drifts on the Lake Shore Road between Buffalo & Erie or Cleaveland. And at Cleaveland there was but very little snow. At Buffalo, there was not really a great deal of snow, but a constant storm and very much wind from Monday till Friday.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102605,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102605","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/008fd14c886e6e301cec4572c1602420.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/008fd14c886e6e301cec4572c1602420.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/008fd14c886e6e301cec4572c1602420.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/008fd14c886e6e301cec4572c1602420.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:57:37+00:00","modified":"2020-09-03T22:02:44+00:00","filename":"008fd14c886e6e301cec4572c1602420.jpg","authentication":"364a20abd962f5bdca1d56ef7a2fd3aa","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_178_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1558024,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2879,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050108190858451},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["233340"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["233340"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["233340"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"008fd14c886e6e301cec4572c1602420.jpg","FileDateTime":1595807720,"FileSize":1558024,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2879\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2879,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:38:15","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:33:40","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:33:40","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3116,"ExifImageLength":3896,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1280,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1280","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"At Chicago the Thermometer was one day 24 degree symbol below Zero, and another 19 degree symbol below.

I have really found something that almost suits me. The only lack appears to be that I have no business occupation here, or any proposed of it. If I had I think I might be pretty well suited here.  Now would it do to move here this spring, hire an office, and set up a shingle  Civ. Eng. & Land Surveyor.  I might possibly earn enough to starve? upon for half a dozen years to come. What do you think of it?   The property is 4 lots each 4 Rods x 8 Rods, well fenced, one or two cross fences. Most of it a beautiful & well cultivated garden, some forest and ornamental trees around? it, and throughout plenty of choice young fruit trees, Apple, Pear, Peach, Plum, Cherry, just beginning to bear. Claims to have had the nicest peaches in the State last year.   Currant & gooseberry? bushes. A good well. A first rate stable 17x21, two stories in good shape, new, built for a house. Then the House! I wish you could see it!  It would make a fine Martinhouse, after we could build a nice Ancelliry house.  Let me describe it - beginning at the front door. \n                                             That? is the house\n\nFront Entry 4 ft. square            Bedroom 6x8\nParlor       12x14                      Kitchen 8x12\nCloset & Chimney 4x4             Closet 4x5\nStairway   4x4                          Entry 4x5\nChamber in roof                         These in a leanto addition, and a shed back of that  \n\nThat is the house itself\n\nsketch of rooms: Cistern  Shed  Summer Store\nBedroom  Kitchen  Closet  Entry\nStair  Closet  Parlor  Entry     Well (outside)","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102621,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/102621","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d7b0d42268c0a0a5421799243720f097.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d7b0d42268c0a0a5421799243720f097.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d7b0d42268c0a0a5421799243720f097.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d7b0d42268c0a0a5421799243720f097.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-26T23:57:59+00:00","modified":"2020-09-03T22:02:44+00:00","filename":"d7b0d42268c0a0a5421799243720f097.jpg","authentication":"bb5b1f34afda1e87bed36bbaa0a99290","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_178_007_002_o2.jpg","size":1628242,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2923,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051578223793414},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["233520"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["233520"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180731"],"TimeCreated":["233520"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d7b0d42268c0a0a5421799243720f097.jpg","FileDateTime":1595807720,"FileSize":1628242,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2923\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2923,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 10:39:01","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:31 23:35:20","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:31 23:35:20","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":6,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2936,"ExifImageLength":3615,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1280,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1280","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The Situation is a beautiful one;

Perhaps it is just as well.  The Mail Train up yesterday ran off the track three or four miles north of here, and left the cars sticking in the mud there still.

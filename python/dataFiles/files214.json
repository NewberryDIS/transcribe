We approve of Tucker's idea, and have with pleasure signed the paper to fix beyond any possibility of doubt our entire satisfaction (and we should add our everlasting gratitude) for the most efficient and generous management of the legacy you so kindly accepted from the executor of Grace's will, consenting to administer it during all these years.

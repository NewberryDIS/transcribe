The bazar that was some times crowded with Negroes [?] and loitering about.  Next the Market street was the most important  There was every thing to be seen that the isle produced in the way of eatables but usually in such small quantities that it was difficult to obtain enough for more than one person without going to a dozen.  Then came the private streets dirty and crooked but not as bad as the public ones.  in every street that I went the Natives looked at me with curious expressions and all seemed as friendly as could be.  The little negroe children seemed amused at me and when two or three of us were together we were followed like a Militia Company is in the states in every street we went there we found the Natives as kind and as polite as curious and inquisitive as Yankees, many poor devils asked me to step in and look at their sick brothers or sisters or fathers.  Many asked me for charms and I followed the example of Mongo Park who gave them the lords prayer,  in many streets I saw black smiths and was induced to stop to look at their work.  The black smith does all his work sitting down.  he has a little shaver who blows the bellows, does it also sitting down.  he blows it with two bags of leather open at top and fitted with two pieces of wood air tight which he opens as he draws it out with thumb and hands.  And shuts as he pushes it from him to keep the air in better pieces of soft hide or skins are fastened on the inside all their work is done sitting  there are also silver smiths on a small scale near the out skirts of the town are a kind of mills to grind the palm oil out of coco & palm trees  the mill was moved by Camels.  The palm oil is sent to America & Europe.  The Town contains about 30,000 inhabitants, Mostly Negroes who are slaves to the Arabs, Banyans, Parsees &c.  the Mosques are very numerous and are well built neat buildings one that I entered was extremely well furnished and clean and was full of worshipers it is the law of the Coran or Koran that an unbeliever entering a Mosque must either turn Mohometan or be put to death;  This is the law every where but in Madagascar and in Mozambique the law has changed this much that you can get off by paying a sum of money.  but here it is different for they are Arab and the Sultan is sei-seid Ben Sultan a true believer and defender of the faith.  Not knowing the custom I mounted the steps leading to the Mosque and entered the door.   There was several fellows on all fours bowed to the ground.  At first I thought they were fastening down the mats but then I saw them get up all facing the same way, bow and down again.   I had hardly time to see these things before I was caught by the arm by one of the Consuls friends who pulled me down off and away in short order I had hardly time to see the half drawn knives and angry glances of the Arabs before I was out of danger.  Capt Wilson gave me a severe lecture about it saying that there were many fanatics who would think it right & proper and that to kill me would please god and the prophet.  After I was more careful and kept a proper distance from them.  The Mohometan confession of faith is this Allah el Allah.  Mahome Ras-ul or god is great and Mahome is his prophet.

There are some learned men amongst the Arabs that is they can read and write and understand the Motions of the planets.   They also have schools the teachers generally get about 10 cts per month from each child.   I saw one who was teaching two youngsters the Koran.  he appeared to know it by heart and read it off in a sort of song as fast as he could talk there is but few or in fact I believe none who can read the bible off the same way (from Memory) for page after page.   When I first saw the Koran I took it for a badly constructed music book.  the reason was the size and musick note like shape of the letters, and the tone and manner of sort o' half singing or chanting it out,  the Banyans or Hindoos are the next most numberous class they are the go ahead sort of people of asia and are great business men of the place.  being the Yankees of Asia.  they Worship a cow and have many strange and superstitious customs.  they believe in a great and universal being who is eternal.  that he made the World has three distinct shapes the above being has various passions and that he delights in assuming the shape of a Cow.  so they purify themselves with cow dung and urine and make gods of wood & copper which they offer sugar honey &c.  they think the the Brahems came from the head and that other mortals came from the more inferior parts of his body.  The Parsees are another sect.  They are also industrious people and are the Jews of Asia.   They have the same religion as the Christians and Jews.  in Their books with this difference.  that they have a Zooroaster as a prophet.  And they think that God is the sun and that his spirit is the flame of fire.  They have their feast of unleaven bread their confessions of sin &c.  but the common people worship fire and the sun without knowing their reference. and this religion once pretty and good is now a blind Idolatry or what is called.  A Parsee will not blow out a light with his breath on any account.  if his house catches on fire he lets it burn down.  Their books tell the same tale about the Creation of the World the fall of Man &c. besides these there are many who worship snakes, lizards, bits of wood, stone, smoke, bones &c.  there are no white men on the island except foreigners.

I saw the man myself he had been sent to England and was well educated and a smart intelligent fellow with a good deal of humor.  Now if the Arab woman who was a respectable one and of high birth was true to her lord does this not prove that the people of Africa have one day turned black.    Back of the town is the burying ground in fact part of the town is built over the burying ground,  it is very irregular and is full of bushes briars and young bamboo canes.  Wild dogs are as thick as hops in it and live and stay there to feed on the dead bodies of the slaves which are brought out but never buried.  I saw several dead Negroes during my stay one of them was on the sea beach.  They allways make it a custom never to bury slave but let dogs eat them or fish devour them.

Near the grave yard is a strait piece of road which the Natives use to run races on them near here also is the slave Market.   There are annually sold, in Zanzibar, upwards of 15,000 slaves.  They are all bought from Africa and are seldom or never fed till they find a master.  Many of them die with hunger and at most they never get more than a hand full of rice.   After they find a Master it is quite a different affair for then they are use by the laws of the Koran to eat when their Master does to eat what he does and the Master is obliged to furnish each slave with a new suit of clothes every time that he buys one himself.  in fact slavery amongst the Arabs is nothing more than serving amongst Christians.   A slave is allowed to speak his mind and works only when he feels like it.  this is the law but the law is not followed. Always and a slaves life then is truely miserable.  it also orders in the Koran that if a slave turn Mahometan he is free but this their master wont allow them to do.  there is a strong  bridge at the north end of the town over an arm of the sea it  is strong but rough.  On the sea Coast is a large square fort with high round towers at each corner.  it was built by the Portuguese in 1537. and no doubt was a strong fort. just in front of this fort is the water battery mounting 22 guns, some of them in good order.   This town and isle was first discovered by the Portuguese who found it inhabited by Negroes and Arabs.  The Portuguese took possession built the fort and flourished for a while but the cupidity averice cruelty and ignorance of human nature soon reduced the place to almost a place of desolation and they possessed authority no further than the range of their long guns.   In the city they established an inquisition which inspired dread they erected a cross and prostrated them selves before and the Mahometans and Savages took them for idolators, the wild negroes and arabs from Africa were afraid to come over for they were liable to be burned at the stake for being heathens.  so at length by the abuse of the laws of Heaven and earth and of all laws of nature humanity and justice and of even law written on in the heart of Man Zanzibar came but an empty possession thus it continued.  The Portuguese fed and fattened on the blood sweat and toil of the Arabs and Negroes till their name was a name of repoch [sic] and hatred as well as of fear and dread.  About 60 years ago the Sultan of Arabia at Mecca sent Ben Sultan the present sultan's father to Muscat to attend to some important business being ambitious and enterprising he soon amassed a large fortune.   The Sultan of Mecca after some time sent letters for him to return.  this he declined doing.  the Sultan of Mecca then sent troops to take him and put him to death but Ben Sultan knew a thing or two for he had by kind treatment presents &c gain the friendship of the Arabs of the desert who acknowledge no man but the prophet and their chiefs.  of these he raised an Army and defeated and took prisoners the greater part of those sent to take him.  The Sultan of Mecca then sent army after army but Ben Sultan defeated them all took all the sea port towns and declared himself Sultan of Arabia upon this the Sultan at Mecca sued for peace which was granted on his ceding all his territory from the mouth of Gulf of Persia to Mozambique inclusive and declairing Ben Sultan the sultan of Muscat  this was done  Ben Sultan then with his troops sailed for Zanzibar landed there","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103417,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103417","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/233f3c64fb91a4580bf53dfb5ac4a00d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/233f3c64fb91a4580bf53dfb5ac4a00d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/233f3c64fb91a4580bf53dfb5ac4a00d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/233f3c64fb91a4580bf53dfb5ac4a00d.jpg"},"added":"2020-09-21T21:17:32+00:00","modified":"2020-10-12T00:43:57+00:00","filename":"233f3c64fb91a4580bf53dfb5ac4a00d.jpg","authentication":"2a219dc0b68479d392356153db000825","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"NL_VAULT_Ayer_MS_119_0126_o2.jpg","size":3065326,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3286,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.08637446180203299517241788407773128710687160491943359375},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"233f3c64fb91a4580bf53dfb5ac4a00d.jpg","FileDateTime":1600722990,"FileSize":3065326,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3286\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3286,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0},"IFD0":{"Model":"Microbox GmbH - Book2Net","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5.7.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:03:02 08:04:24"},"EXIF":{"ExifVersion":230}}}},"item":{"id":1285,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1285","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"and ordered the Portuguese garrison to surrender this they refused upon which the sultan attacked the place on two sides at once. at first they were repelled for the Portuguese knew their fate if he succeeded the next day he again tried it on all sides.  it was a long well fought battle the Portuguese stood to their guns till the last.  the Musslemen had made scaling ladders of bamboo.  these they fixed on the walls but the Portuguese threw them down men and all, but the Arabs were soon up and at it again.  but now the Portuguese had began to grow weaker  Many of their guns could not be worked for want of Men and the Arabs growing more furious again attempted scaling.  this time tho gallantly opposed they succeeded the Portuguese were slaughtered like sheep, and few were spared to tell the tale.

An American ship came in from Boston.  she was out on a trading voyage  She met with a great deal of opposition here from the Yankee traders who fear interlopers:  I never saw such fierce opposition before in the way of trade.  there was a total eclipse of the Moon on the 24th.  I never saw a prettier sight in my life.   The Natives were all very much frightened and kept up an incessant drumming all night howling dancing and singing beating on drums tin pans and boards making a most infernal clatter to scare away the big devil that was going to swallow the Moon.   I had told several men a day or so previous about the eclipse they only laughed at me and asked me how I knowed.  when they saw me again they pulled off their head covers to me as a great man.

The next day we discovered a small isle 2 pts on the lee bow, ran down for it anchored near it and sent a boat ashore.  this is Lathams isle it is a barren isle and is surrounded with dangerous coral shoals.  We found it literaly [sic] covered with sea or aquatic fowls so numerous that we had to be careful to push them away.   They were so tame that they disputed the ground with us and pinched our legs as we passed.  We sent out boats to sound and about 12 M got underway.  for 8 or 10 days we had light airs gradually hauling from the N' & E' to the N' & W'  During the night watches we kept a bright look out and for a look out to be caught asleep here abouts was certain punishment.  The cause of this was that we were cruising in that part of the sea which abounds in coral reefs where many ships had been lost and where new shoals are discovered almost every day.  We passed in sight of Aldabra isle. passed the Seychelle isles.  The Seychelle isles are  small group of isles lying to the N' of Madagascar.   They are inhabited by Malagash and french men.  Tis on this isle that a singular tree grows which has never been found in any other part of the world.  The nuts are called Coco De Mer. and at one time were thought to have grown in the sea.  Some of them were picked up on the coast of Hindustan and they brought [?] their weight in gold.   On the 10th Decr found ourselves in the little Monsoon.   This is a west wind which blows along the line fair and fresh for vessels bound east.  It rained all the time sometimes in squalls sometimes in a steady pour.  it would have been but little trouble to have filled the ship up but it was neglected.  This weather was quite refreshing to us for the Channel wheather [sic] had universally been hot sultry and melting weather.   Now we found it quite pleasant for the rains cooled the atmosphere.  Decr 20th an old fore-mast man died suddenly.  he had only been sick 2 days.  This cast a general gloom over the ship for this was the 1st death.  the sick list had been increasing gradually since leaving Zanzibar and there was now 50 on the list:  This old fellow died without any one near him and was found next morning standing up against the bulk-head dead.  We buried him our 1st lieut lead prayers and the blue indian Ocean is his grave.  On the 23rd on [sic] the bandsmen died.  he had been sick a long time his son was near him all the time of his sickness.  we buried him as we had done the other with the usual ceremonies of half masting the flag and reading prayers.  Decr. 25th: today  is Christmas.  to day we crossed the line and to day we crossed the 180th Meridian of my Home. and to day appeared the comet and to day was a beautiful sunset.  how many things seem to happen this day.   I am sure it must be a good sign.  The Sultan had given us a goat which we had been saving all along for a Christmas dinner.   I had also bought a large lot of chickens in Zanzibar and intended to save them for Christmas but hard usage was too hard for them and we had to kill them to save their lives.  Decr 31st an old forecastle man died we buried him at sea.  New years day.  Made the high land of Sumatra.  Winds being light we anchored about 18 miles from the land.  The land of Sumatra is very high.  there is one active volcano on the isle whose \nsumit [sic] is 3000 feet higher than the peak of Teneriffe.  The Next day standing up along the land.  Jany 3 anchored off Qualla Battoo or Soo-soo.   Whilst in the offing we saw a small  [?prou?] standing along the land.  we gave chase. and soon brought her to with a round shot across her bows.  she was a well built boat her capt was very much frightened We found an American vessel laying here loading with pepper.  She reported to us that two pirates had been seen in the offing but seeing us had made sail for other parts.  Quallah Battoo was taken and burned some yars ago by the American Frigate Columbia for having taken an American Ship and Murdered the crew.  She at the same time burned Muckie.  Since then they have respected American ships.  There was an old  ugly devil on board yesterday who entertained the Mids with an Account of the Murder of the Crew of a French Man &  some of the Mids were very anxious to knock the old devil on the head for his crimes.  but it was not our business or policy. so we had to let the old devil alone and laugh at our selves for our anger.

The Natives along this coast are the most treacherous rascals known they are all robbers and pirates and fear neither god nor devil the only thing that keep them under is the fear of a white mans cutlass or guns.  When brought into action by white men they are the greatest cowards, and will never engage unless they have about two to one.  The Merchent [sic] Men go well armed and with men and officers are always prepared with bowie knikes [sic] and pistols.  Some years ago an American vessel touched in at Muckie the Natives prepared to attack her and as soon as her crew got ashore to weigh pepper the Malays put off attacked her and took her killing every one on board but the Mate with 6 Men were ashore well armed he saw and heared [sic] the firing so he shoved off boarded her drove the Malays over the bows killing about half of them whilst in the Water the sharks ate about half of the survivors.  since then they have kept shy of Americans and english vessels.  for we are so much stronger than the Malays that that [sic] an American is a match for two or three of them at least.  The Capt sent on shore for the head Rajahs to Come off this they did the Capt took them in the Cabin and had a long talk with them threatening that if ever they insulted an American ship that he would return and hang their Rajahs in the nearest tree.

An American Capt had a head Rajah as his friend and did a great deal of business with him.  Whilst weighing out pepper one day, the Capt was attacked and stabbed.  he ran to this Rajah for protection as his friend but his friend the Rajah stabed [sic] him to the heart after this the rest of the crew were massacred the ship robbed and burned.  There is a peculiar kind of knife these devils wear called the Kreese or Creese.  it is a crooked knife and is normally poisoned.   They never go without one.  in the interior of the isle tis said are lare [sic] forests of Camphor trees and besides, there many other kinds of curious and useful woods.  from here is got the Gum Benjamin which is burned in Catholic Churches.  Sandal and Ebony wood is also very common.  The Religion of these people is Mostly Mahometan tho there are many pagans and some who believe in No god but that all happened so their laws are founded on this principal viz Might is right.  The island is full of wild animals of which the hog is the Most Numerous.  Wild buffaloes of a peculiar kind called the mud buffaloes are very common.  They are a singular kind of cow or bull having no hair on them but almost black their horns lay back and are very long.  they are some what the nature of the hippopotamus for they lay in the mud with nothing but their nose sticking out.  Sometimes the Natives of one town sends a challenge to those of another [crossed out: and say that] to fight buffaloes.  after a great deal of talk and a great deal of betting they are at last brought together the commence by backing off about a hundred yards and running together - head on the rebound sometimes bings them over on their backs or breaks their necks.  they keep on this way until one or the other is whiped [sic] or killed then the Natives get to quarrelling on the strength of it and some refuse to pay bets until they get to fighting and there is a war between the two towns.  in the evening when the land breeze blows off shore the air is filled with pleasant perfumes of all kinds.  the Mountain sides are said to be entirely covered with Spicey woods &c.

On the West Coast the rivers are swift on the east Coast they have slow currents and frequently overflow their banks.  On these rivers are imense [sic] impenetrable jungles looking thick enough to cut slices out, aye almost solid.  These jungles are always green and the vines and bushes twine into each other, so that a man can not see into them.  There they are filled with all manner of wild animals, amongst them stands the tiger, as number one both on account of his strength and numbers.  There is also 2 or 3 lakes in the interior, one of which is about 60 miles long, and 40 wide.  The scenery around these lakes is beautifully grand and picturesque.  I dare say they equal if not surpass the scenery around the Scotish lakes which we read and hear so much of, and it may be that some day.  A Malay Walter Scott, will give them to the world, in words and letters, as Scott has done before them.  There are numerous villages on the banks fo these lakes and they are so thickly shaded with the spreading mangrove, that it difficult to discover the bamboo huts of the Natives.  Nor is this all.  fruit of all kinds common to the climate flourishes without cultivation.  Pea-cocks with their beautiful plumage strut thro the forests, wild, and others pick their food near the huts of the Natives tame,  Chickens (how strange it seems) are here wild and are hunted by the Natives for food.   It is not an uncommon thing to hear the Cock a doodle doo in these jungles, on the lakes which are said to be clear and so deep that they look blue and black, are numerous proas light and graceful looking boats.

The fabled tree which threw out its poisonous vapors for 20 miles around killing birds and beasts and trees or rather all animal and vegetable matter was said to exist in this island.  the story arose from a tradition of the Natives which had reference to a volcano instead of a tree but the dutch (who first settled this isle) from their ignorance of the Malay language thought it a tree and so spread the report and hence the {crossed out: fable} story.  Orang-o-tang which is a Malay word means Man of the Woods so orang-o-pulto means Men of the sea or sailors.  The orang-o-tang is very numerous.  The Malays say that they live together in towns built of leaves and sticks in the impenetrable jungles. and subsist on the animal and vegetable matter that the woods afford.  There are said to be two different species differing in the texture and color of the hair the one called the Cooboo is said to be very much like the human race. so much so that the Malays are said to take some of the most likely cooboo girls to wife  the offspring after the 2 or 3 generation loose all appearance of the orang o tang in their wild state they build huts and frequently attack tigers and elephants for food on the approach of a Man they always run off and are quite harmless unless wounded.   They can be taught almost any thing I have seen them sweep out a room and others have been learned to wait on the table.   Tigers which are very numerous and dangerous attacking the Malays almost every day.  never attack the orang-o-tang but on the contrary the orang o tangs attack them with clubs &c and either break their heads or strangle them with their long sinewy arms.  They are very strong for some times they when wounded will pick up a Malay and run up a tree the same as a Man would pick up a child and walk off.  in fighting with the Malays they with one blow will break an arm or leg.  some of them grow to the highth of 8 or 9 feet and after killing a buffaloe will pick it up and walk off.  Now all the above about the orang o tang May be a yarn but I give it as the Malays tell it, The Malays have a kind of superstitious dread concerning tigers thinking they are some way connected with God on that account they Never hunt them nor kill them except in cases of necessity.

The dutch have settled the south part of the island and have several large factories.  they are nearly always at war with the natives.  There is one man who is called king of the isle living at Acheen but his power does not extend further than gun shot from his fort.  when the Malays kill any animal for food they never use fire arms if they can help it but turn its head towards Mecca and kill it.  Most of them are Mohometans but there are Many who have no religion at all and others who are what the Christians call Idolaters tho not more so than the Christians for they all use emblems and the Christians being more refined makes a pretty one whilst the poor Malay paints or carves a hideous one.  tho with the same intention  one is said to worship god the other idols. and this is said by Christians who [?most?] the Malays call us idolators.  Some distinguished divine wrote a Christian hymn saying the indian in his blindness bows down to wood and stone, where as they pray to god as much as Christians.  And if a Hindu should come into a Catholic church would they not suppose we were Idolaters or in other churches would they not think we pray to nothing at all.  The Malays use the poisoned knife on almost every occasion.  The poison is the juice of a green pine apple.  a slight wound from one of these knives is nearly always fatal in 3 or 4 hours.

Their plays are said to have more of the comedie than of the tragic about them, their songs are always sung in an unnatural voice and it seems to be with great difficulty that they sing any thing  their music is of a very rude kind such as almost to shock one.  it appeared to me something like the sharpening of a saw and the rattleing of a cart.  The Malays here are a very piratical race and are remarkable for being a desperate set of fellows neither giving or receiving quarter.  they are mortal enemies to the chinese and kill them on every opportunity.  such is the dread  of the Chinese for the Malay that they have formed secret bands for the purpose of protection and should a Malay be killed by one of this band no other of the band or other chinese dare give evidence against him,  The Chinese here are two thirds of the population and no doubt will soon drive the Malays out of the country.  The Malays are very much like our indians in these respects, in their war dances in their marriages and in their scalping the dead.  another thing they resemble the Indians in is their inordinate desire for spirits and their fast disappearance before as well as their dislike to civilized life.

The City of Manilla is built on a level plain and at a short distance its numerous forts and domes and spires give it a beautiful and imposing appearance, besides this the City is divided into two parts one called the Spanish town and the other the Native town.  the Native town is nearly twice as large as the White but the White city is very strongly fortified and walled it is as strong a place as I have seen for a long time  a ditch surrounds the whole place about 30 feet wide and full of water.  on the most assailable point there are three walls and two ditches with drawbridges & the whole city of Manilla may be said to be built amongst churches for near every 10th house is a church.  and such churches as are seldom seen viz large Massive buildings with high towering steeples and deep toned bells and the whole interior is decorated with images & painting of our Saviour which pious fathers and sisters have from time to time presented to the church, some of these paintings I have heard were very old and so they looked and some of them were remarkably well executed.  The altars are usually nearby and in many instances are gorgeously decorated with gilt or gold ornaments, these set off by numerous lights which are kept continually burning, besides which as it was a feast day or rather a Collection of feasts and the alters were decorated with branches of orange and other trees, which gave the whole church an air of quietness and innocence that would [crossed out: have been] be difficult to describe.

She was a 24 gun sloop of war 32 pounders.

There was a cry of Terror thro the ship the Main [?] tree was shot away and the flapping of the sail with the confusion on deck and the fright of the man at the wheel put her up in the wind and flat aback.  in less time than I have taken to tell it the 25th of May luffed under our stern [?] sharp up and gave us he same broadside a raking fire but tho this did us a great deal of damage it killed fewer men than the first fire for all the [?cholows?] ran down into the hold & cockpit and no one was to be seen at their quarters but the officers and the few Americans French English and dutch who were on board.  many of the cholous were run thro by their officers or shot down by them for their base cowardice.  as we were so superior to the 25 of May in every thing they concluded best to haul off tho had they given us another broadside we would have been obliged to surrender, so she hauled close on a wind.

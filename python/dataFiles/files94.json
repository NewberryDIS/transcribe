He adhered to his regulation diet of fish and potatos cocoa and bread and applesauce but it seemed good to have him at the table once more. For the last two nights he has not taken any nourishment in the night. I fancy he is trying to return to the old time practices but he still has his supper about six o'clock consisting last night of mush and maple syrup only.

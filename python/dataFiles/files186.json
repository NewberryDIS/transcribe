I am quite anxious that you should come here and feel sure that it will profit you more than to go to Norwich. That as a Classical Institution is exceedingly defective. Mathematics can be pursued anywhere with almost equal success or alone even but the Classics are entirely of a different character and in my opinion of equal importance in making up a thorough education. The laws of this Institution require that the individual who enters to an advanced standing should pay half the tuition of the course -this fall. But this rule is not peculiar to this College alone & is the same at all colleges of my acquaintance. There is an advantage here the student can be out twelve weeks in the winter without subjecting himself to the necessity of making it up I think when you close your schools you had better come here and see how you like and what you can do for yourself. I hope you will conclude to enter here","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42763,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/42763","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/cd2f500aaf37473b2357cf0ccc4ebbb0.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/cd2f500aaf37473b2357cf0ccc4ebbb0.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/cd2f500aaf37473b2357cf0ccc4ebbb0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cd2f500aaf37473b2357cf0ccc4ebbb0.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:36:23+00:00","modified":"2020-04-27T04:10:00+00:00","filename":"cd2f500aaf37473b2357cf0ccc4ebbb0.jpg","authentication":"ced887a8ab758e88c32415fbd0450089","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_088_007_003_o2.jpg","size":1566137,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2845,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050971066848923},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["021607"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["021607"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["021607"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cd2f500aaf37473b2357cf0ccc4ebbb0.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460516,"FileSize":1566137,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2845\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2845,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:00:43","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:16:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:16:07","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":72,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3348,"ExifImageLength":4236,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Our next vacation occurs in a fortnight.

Jam 29th 1846\n\nMr. Kendall, Sir,\n\n                                   Last Sabbath morn, my heart was made glad by the sight of another token of your regard for me. It ever gives me pleasure to hear from friends & acquaintances, especially those who have rendered themselves dear to me by repeated acts of kindness. It is good to have friends, who who, we can in confidence to communicate our joys & our griefs; who will sympathize with us in our sorrows & rejoice with us in our happiness.\n              You mention the death of your brother. May God comfort you in your affliction. It seems hard to part with those we love, yet, thank God I have never been called to part (by death) with any of mine, except my Grandfather, since I was six years of age.\n         You seem to be not at all sparing of compliments but, I am fearful that I am not deserving of so much. With regard to climbing that \"hill,\" I must sat, that my progress   --if I make any, --- is very slow. If I look onward, \"the top of the hill, & the temple of Truth,\" appear as far distant as ever; - if I look back, I can see that I have advanced a little. I am determined, however, not to turn aside or go back. As to \"Pleasure,\" in what can it be had, if not in this, if \"Virtue accompany is? I may yet get lost, in the mazes of \"Ignorance,\" or bound in her \"chains\" or I may yet","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42770,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/42770","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/45a056dbbf9459967c91bf533e5e22a4.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/45a056dbbf9459967c91bf533e5e22a4.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/45a056dbbf9459967c91bf533e5e22a4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/45a056dbbf9459967c91bf533e5e22a4.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:36:47+00:00","modified":"2020-04-27T04:29:27+00:00","filename":"45a056dbbf9459967c91bf533e5e22a4.jpg","authentication":"66f5289adc2f63a98eed7727d94a1c69","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_088_009_002_o2.jpg","size":1751524,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2836,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05718552473489},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["021701"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["021701"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["021701"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"45a056dbbf9459967c91bf533e5e22a4.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460516,"FileSize":1751524,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2836\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2836,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:01:03","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:17:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:17:01","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3327,"ExifImageLength":4222,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"go down the stream of \"Insignificance\" and be buried in the gulf of Oblivion; but if I do, I promise you it shall not be in consequence of \"Indolence.\" Yet, let is always bear in mind that \"Science may raise one to eminence; but Virtue alone can ensure us felicity.\" May we, I say bear this in mind & let virtue be our constant companion.\n\n            Please - accept my thanks for the solution of that problem.  The moment I cast my eye on it, I saw at a glance the rock on which I hung, and when I saw your first supposition, I took my slate and worked it through, before tracing yours through. In my former trials I had x equal one term, then when I added them together there were two unknown quantities in the equation. I then tried to work it by substituting the value of X, for X. but on multiplying together it produced an equation, which in my present stage of Algebraic knowledge I could not reduce, (if it can be reduced), at all. It never occurred to me (yo will wonder at my dullness) that X could be anything else.

             I received yours with joy & thankfulness, as it not only informed me that you were well & doing well, but bu it I see that you are still regardful of me. I was glad to hear that you had got into a place where you will have some help, as it is hard for a teacher to drag the school along with him when the parents are hanging back.   You will conclude from the date of this. that I am not at home, --that is true, -- I feel that I am not at home.  I closed my school there Saturday, Jan. 9.  You know the circumstances which existed before I commenced, and what was apprehended, but on entering the school I found that such feelings did not extend to the scholars. Everything has gone off harmoniously & as far as  I know, to the perfect satisfaction of all concerned. The interest manifested by the scholars, their deportment and their progress were truly gratifying to me. Nothing better could have been required in any aspect. The parents, too, have done more than I expected. I believe I told you before, what had been done by getting of books, for the children, and in addition 20 visits from the parents, --more than all I ever knew before in this district.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42788,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/42788","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/cf06c261c2f9df2fe45744669304e8bb.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/cf06c261c2f9df2fe45744669304e8bb.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/cf06c261c2f9df2fe45744669304e8bb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cf06c261c2f9df2fe45744669304e8bb.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:37:48+00:00","modified":"2020-04-28T03:07:54+00:00","filename":"cf06c261c2f9df2fe45744669304e8bb.jpg","authentication":"a5f5db7075f12b145843dc83f680cec4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_088_014_002_o2.jpg","size":1484210,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2816,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048802149095118},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["021914"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["021914"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["021914"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cf06c261c2f9df2fe45744669304e8bb.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460517,"FileSize":1484210,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2816\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2816,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:01:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:19:14","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:19:14","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3361,"ExifImageLength":4296,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"This, you know encourages both teacher & scholars. and has an influence on the school which is not realized & appreciated by but few.\n\n  But, as I said before, I feel that I am not at home,- that I am not in that school.\n  The next day after I closed there, application was made to me to teach a school here, and in less than 2 hours I was on my way to W.

But, as that pleasure is forbidden me I will improve the only substitute for it, and I hope it will be as acceptable to you as it is agreeable to me. In the first place I will give you an inkling of my present situation. I am in my second school and have been here a little more than two weeks. Not exactly in the Mount Caeser School, but in the same district, and with some of the former pupils of Mt. C. Seminary.\nI have about 45 scholars, embracing, of course, a great variety of dispositions, habit, propensities, etc. We find, you know, some who have been indulged by mistaken parents in almost every childish whim, -- some, who have been debarred from even innocent amusement, --Some who have been taught that money is the root of all good and must procured at all events, -- Some in fact of every possible description (almost) and all our talent for government, all our knowledge of human nature must be exercised. And not only does the teacher have the numerous & conflicting dispositions of his pupils to encounter, but, what is often worse, those of nearly as many parents.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42796,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/42796","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c387fd077732cae56470e7d5e1b75505.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/c387fd077732cae56470e7d5e1b75505.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/c387fd077732cae56470e7d5e1b75505.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c387fd077732cae56470e7d5e1b75505.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:38:16+00:00","modified":"2020-04-28T03:34:10+00:00","filename":"c387fd077732cae56470e7d5e1b75505.jpg","authentication":"2f9b5032af64c6aae99c4ed538515d3d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_089_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1752035,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2852,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05688129837411},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022028"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022028"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022028"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c387fd077732cae56470e7d5e1b75505.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460517,"FileSize":1752035,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2852\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2852,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:02:17","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:20:28","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:20:28","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3287,"ExifImageLength":4148,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Too often is it the case that, when the child takes a little offence he is encouraged by his parents. to disobey again and this is a fruitful source of more mischief.\n    I would not have you to infer that such is the case here more than in many other places, I was speaking of a too common evil.

Yes all have this privilege literally without money & without price. But do all avail themselves of it? Do all enjoy it who might? No. Some there are, -- and such are to be pitied, -- who can pass their 'three score years & ten' without discovering anything beautiful in nature; -- Some there are who, if they cannot see the shining dollars, or what will produce them, cannot see anything worth seeing. When they see a beautiful tree they only think how many feet of boards it will make, and how much it will \"come to.\"\nWhen they see a waterfall they only think as did one on a visit to Niagara, \"What an almighty sight of mills that water would carry\" and he sorely lamented the loss of the water.

Washington.\nYou no doubt see the city papers every day, and \nhear great reports of Cholera - the reports in the papers\nmay be relied upon; and there has scarcely been a case\nwhere it could not be traced to imprudence or neglect on\nthe part of the victim.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42810,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/42810","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/6a498f08efd511e811dbf5d8cdc626dc.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/6a498f08efd511e811dbf5d8cdc626dc.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/6a498f08efd511e811dbf5d8cdc626dc.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6a498f08efd511e811dbf5d8cdc626dc.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:39:05+00:00","modified":"2020-04-28T21:31:01+00:00","filename":"6a498f08efd511e811dbf5d8cdc626dc.jpg","authentication":"9502e90bf881bcd83394d364144ef429","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_089_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1318271,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2959,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041251142152629},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022201"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022201"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022201"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6a498f08efd511e811dbf5d8cdc626dc.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460518,"FileSize":1318271,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2959\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2959,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:02:55","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:22:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:22:01","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":43,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3320,"ExifImageLength":4039,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"We are only tolerably well - Mr. Reaugh has been sick for two of three days, and Upton is not very well, but nothing serious in either case.\nHoping you are all well, and forgetting your old friends in Louisville.

The crop of corn\nis very promising and you may expect to see a great many fat\nhogs next fall.\nYour friend &c\nJames Wright.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42820,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/42820","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/25bd537cc43b5ee6e0d69e02b2d3db85.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/25bd537cc43b5ee6e0d69e02b2d3db85.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/25bd537cc43b5ee6e0d69e02b2d3db85.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/25bd537cc43b5ee6e0d69e02b2d3db85.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:39:40+00:00","modified":"2020-04-29T00:58:16+00:00","filename":"25bd537cc43b5ee6e0d69e02b2d3db85.jpg","authentication":"976502a132bcd332260d658460a743c1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_089_008_001_o2.jpg","size":1754594,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2819,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057631219371198},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022344"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022344"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022344"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"25bd537cc43b5ee6e0d69e02b2d3db85.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460518,"FileSize":1754594,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2819\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2819,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:03:23","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:23:44","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:23:44","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3307,"ExifImageLength":4222,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Meger\n                                                                                                  Spencer County Ky.

Since you left here my health has not been very good, You will remember that about the time school closed or a little before I took a bad cold which settled on my lungs. this I suppose caused me to have a spell of the Childs and fevers these kept me in bad health& for three or four weeks since that time my health has been improving and I can now say that I am be well. The Cholrea has not been very bad around here any how it has not got hold of me yet. While I was sick I received word from a Nighborhood in the upper & edge of Spenser Co that the people wanted me to teach a school I visited the people and they made up a very good school it is in a very good place for the business and I think I am likely to do well. My school was quite small at first it now numbers 18 or 20 and likely to be about 30 before long. The only dread that remains to me is the responsibility of my station and that I am not better prepared for discharging the duties","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42821,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/42821","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/69c905ae421e8c9d836495cdddea8419.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/69c905ae421e8c9d836495cdddea8419.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/69c905ae421e8c9d836495cdddea8419.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/69c905ae421e8c9d836495cdddea8419.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:39:42+00:00","modified":"2020-04-29T01:02:00+00:00","filename":"69c905ae421e8c9d836495cdddea8419.jpg","authentication":"e97c171d2dea3622d60dbbec7cd4e804","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_089_008_002_o2.jpg","size":1479484,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2815,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048664035260838},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022353"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022353"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022353"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"69c905ae421e8c9d836495cdddea8419.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460518,"FileSize":1479484,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2815\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2815,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:03:26","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:23:53","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:23:53","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3254,"ExifImageLength":4160,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"devolving upon me as a teacher.

Washington, Ky\nJuly 21,th 1849\nMr. Kenall\nDear Sir\nAfter having waited anxiously, and almost abandoned the idea of receiving a letter from you, I have the pleasure of acknowledging the receipt of one to day.

I should not write at this time except under the peculiar circumstances existing. Mrs. Hikes (Mr. Edward Hikes' mother) is dangerously ill  --her recovery is somewhat doubtful and my wife thinks I ought to inform you of the fact as your sister and Miss W. knowing it would be much pleasanter for them and at the same time more convenient for Mr. Hikes' family, would prefer coming some other time than the present.  You cannot think how disappointed we are. Ever since we came from Mt.

James H. Hobbs to N.K.\nHuntsville Arkansas April 18, 1850\nMr. Kendall\nDear Sir:-\nPerhaps you have looked for a letter from me and wondered why I did not write, and have thought for a moment that I had forgotten my promise, or that that respect and love that I now have and ever have had since our first acquaintance, for you had waxed cold. The reason that I have not written, because I have forgotten you! Forget the many pleasant moments that we have spent together in the capacity of teacher and student and also socially? Forget the rambles we have taken near the pleasant village of Mt. Washington seeking some of those pure streams of water whose meandering course finds their way over those high rocks! All these things forgotten: No,Sir,ungrateful indeed would I be to let such moments of pleasure pass by unnoticed and unappreciated. Those b books which you taught me to peruse by being absent from me may be forgotten. Mythology, Aesops Fables and other parts of Latin may slip the memory but those lessons that I received at your room when the flickering taper supplied the great luminary of day I would be thrice happy could I call it the same way that I have in by gone days: Miss Kendall no less natural sounds her name and memory wanders back and tells me that I was a student also of hers, that lesson after lesson, and instruction after instruction I have heard fall from her lips. \nWhile these things are flickering across my mind the thought arises\"Where am I\". Am I in such a country as you are;where prosperity, happiness and pleasure may attend all, or am I in a country where these things are not known. Really I know not how to answer the question for I never have been at any place where the people enjoyed themselves better than here. I am n near the Red Man's home and now and then we can see the squaws carrying such packs as they do. The smoke of their wigwarms may be seen assending which seems to tell the doleful tale that the tribe will soon be extinct.\nIn my imagination I see you going up to the Academy and after you have got there I see you figuring around as though your whole soul was ingaged, imparting instruction and building a foundation for many pupils that may lead them to future happiness, prosperity and renown. God bless the Teacher, Though he's bothered, perplexed and harrassed by his bad pupils there is a pleasure arising from a consciousness of doing good. I have the honor to be the principal of the Huntsville School and think that I am getting along very well. I know not how much longer I will teach school as I expect to comment the practice of law before a great while.\nTell my brother and his family , howdy. Present my kindest love to all friends and reserve the same\nyours truly, \nJames H.Hobbs.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42858,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/42858","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/13891069c6e9f74606f2b0b712a0e269.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/13891069c6e9f74606f2b0b712a0e269.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/13891069c6e9f74606f2b0b712a0e269.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/13891069c6e9f74606f2b0b712a0e269.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:41:42+00:00","modified":"2020-04-30T03:33:09+00:00","filename":"13891069c6e9f74606f2b0b712a0e269.jpg","authentication":"528ffa0e6bab4f3337598ba9a027dd9d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_090_006_001_o2.jpg","size":1631757,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2812,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053729947052315},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022956"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022956"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022956"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"13891069c6e9f74606f2b0b712a0e269.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460520,"FileSize":1631757,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2812\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2812,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:05:10","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:29:56","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:29:56","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3388,"ExifImageLength":4337,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Georgetown Kentucky   Sept. 28th  50\n\nMost worthy Tutor---\n\n                                                              It is with gratification that I embrace this oportunity of addressing you in Compliance with my feelings and promise.

I told them I new nothing about Greek, but I could learn faster in college than in the Kitchens (as it termed) so I reviewed my grammar and came in college last Monday.

At the time the city of Orleans was beseiged by the duke of Bedford. Joan pretended to have received a divine communication to expel the invaders. She was introduced to Charles VII, she offered to raise the seige of Orleans and conduct the prince to Reims to be crowned, at the same time demanding for herself a consecrated sword that had for a long time hung in the Church of St. Catherine. Her request was granted and she at the head of her army entered triumphant the city of Orleans, and appeared in a splendid armour at the coronation of Charles which took place in the Cathedral of Reims. She then though her mission done and sought to retire to private life, but  but finally yielded to the public wish and and remained in public life.  She was finally taken by the English I think, and was condemned to death and actually was burned at the stake in the Market place of Rouen in the early part of the year 1431.

I think he is somewhat inclined to fewer. Miss Weed wrote me that she would sell it for $150 Eve less, for the sake of selling & receiving the money promptly. I was disappointed that you could not come up last week for I wanted to see you - but I was glad that you was not present, at the Examination. It was not such an Examination as would have suited you or me.\n\n[top] I shall be released one of these days. I have several times about concluded to leave here at the close of this Session & rest during the Summer. I am completely worn out: & I think it almost sinful in me to attempt to teach.-when I find my duties so irksome but I think I will try and give myself for one more session. (I shall only teach four months) then I will rest awhile. I shall Expect you up here as soon as you return from Indiana.

I think the prospect is very good for getting good teachers, at least they are well recommended; however, it is impossible to form anything like a correct idea of them until we see them.  Ocular & avuncular demonstrate all are required to form an opinion in such cases. I hope however they may have the rare luck to please all hands. We are all interested in having good teachers, & I am certain that I will do all I can to help them on.\n\n                                                     I wold like to know how the world goes on with you or more properly how you get along in it. I hope you are comfortably ensconced where you may live easy and have a full share of enjoyment, for I tell you that both of those items in the bill of human experience are not common property. I presume you are engaged in furthering the deep and unrivaled mysteries of the human organization, I feel that you will be greatly interested --for I believe there is nothing else, in which there is as great an exemplification of ingenuity and design. There is always something new and interesting to me, some thing to arouse my wonder, or to excite my admiration.

But a sad requiem has sounded, as the March of Time has wafted two times and almost three years to my notice, and duty calls me to the alarm of a change of vocation. But, Miss K., I had rather be a student than anything Else. To be a student I would freely undergo the difficulty of pronunciation in French - Latin verbs and nouns, and almost anything in the shape of Study. My Schooldays have Ended with an unfinished Education--much regretted. There is a great deal of ignorance in this country, and So I cannot Enjoy myself here like I could at Marietta. I have done nothing yet in the way of Speaking, but Expect to soon. Miss Kendall, who were your French Scholars? How did they get along? I wish I could finish French for I liked the study. I wish you to tell me if the French Colloquy was spoken, and how it went off. How do you get along in Music? What Scholars played at the Examination? What kind of music and who else played at the Exercises. I'd almost  give a $1000 could I have been there Now, does the baby grow much? I would like to see it very much. How do the Weavers do, and what their progress in Study and Music? Give them my regards. You have lost a splendid scholar---Miss Pollock alias Mrs. Peters.

I know of no others that I would be happier to corespond with, with the hope of improvement than yourself and sister, if the burden will not be to heavy it will afford me much happiness to keep up a regular corespondence with you until we should meet again, if that should ever be\n\nyou will think by this time that what I told you last summer is true about my thoughts being entirely unconnected, if you do not I shall think you are an unbeliever. I shall look for an answer to this before many weeks roll by and I beg you will not disappoint me, give my best love to Sarah and I will bid good night   from thy cincere friend and well wishes   Adieu,, Betty C Bennett","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42916,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/42916","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/09f5d94edf50cc01c603a3c5c6fca694.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/09f5d94edf50cc01c603a3c5c6fca694.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/09f5d94edf50cc01c603a3c5c6fca694.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/09f5d94edf50cc01c603a3c5c6fca694.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:44:50+00:00","modified":"2020-05-01T15:48:50+00:00","filename":"09f5d94edf50cc01c603a3c5c6fca694.jpg","authentication":"446d538338e962fc8c290535527c329f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_092_004_004_o2.jpg","size":1176354,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2942,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.037023000226603},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["024355"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["024355"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["024355"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"09f5d94edf50cc01c603a3c5c6fca694.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460522,"FileSize":1176354,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2942\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2942,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:07:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:43:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:43:55","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":33,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3340,"ExifImageLength":4087,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"[postmark] MCCONNELL O.

the left as many pains, aches, blues and dumps as commonly fall to the lot of a mortal of no more note than myself. \n                             But in the first place how is your health at present?  You wrote that it was no better than when you was in Kentucky. I was sorry to hear it. How does the cold weather affect you? Do you feel better or worse on account of it? It completely freezes me up. I wish I was in the Bermudas or the West Indies, and if I had the means or any way provided, I'd go. My health at the time of my writing last, was improving and I was quite Sanguine in regard to it; but latterly it has been quite poor. I engaged a school for the winter but have been obliged to abandon the idea of teaching at present. The doctors think my disease to be upon the liver, and I am now taking medicine for it.

They will have studied the gospel of Matthew critically, and Seilen on the Principles of Interpretation an Porter's Principles of Textual Criticism, Also the Hebrew Grammar, and perhaps a dozen Chapters in the Hebrew bible. Probably Mr. Kendall will find it difficult to purchase a copy of Porter and Seilen. But I presume he can have one from Divinity Hall.

Since reading that I have read Scotts Heart of the Mid Lothian and Goldsmiths Vicar of Wakefield which the Critics place at the head of ficticous writing -and I must say that I decidedly prefer David Copperfield to Either of these. It is now nearly a year since I have read the latter and yet almost every day I find the scenes and Characters which the artist has so vividly portrayed rising up in my mind with all the distinctness of real life. For a combination of all that is pure beautiful and lovely --for the very beau ideal of female loveliness, I think Agnes surpasses anything I have Ever met with in fiction.

Often times have I thought at the close of school, that I never could enjoy myself so well another term but never have I left a school with such feelings as I did that last. I know not how it is, but a new impulse seemed to be given, and my thoughts were turned in a different direction.

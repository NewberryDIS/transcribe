Beeson, Cashier,\nOsawatomie, Kansas.\nMy dear Sir: --\nOur next installment of rent from the farm will not be paid until early in November, and I wish to have the privilege of deferring payment of the note until after this rent money is received. I had intended doing what little business I have at Osawatomie at your bank, but I rented the farm this year through an agent, who had the notes payable at the F. and M. Bank. I will attend to the note as soon as I learn of this money being paid.\nI may say that my mistake in overdrawing my account was one of the results of renting the farm through an agent and not directly. The terms were somewhat different from those of preceding years, the first payment being in November instead of earlier in the year. I had no paid especial attention to that provision and had forgotten it and so presumed there was plenty of money in the bank. However, I think I am getting a better rent than if I had done the business myself.\nSincerely yours,\nJ..Ed. Everett.\nP.S. Let me know, please, whether it will be all right for me to defer payment till the rent money is paid in November 3. J.E.E.\nAll right. Hope you can have the business transferred to us again. \nYours truly\nO.T.

She will go to school in Maryland next year.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":28142,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/28142","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/65eb1889bd64bca9b471f84236e0c980.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/65eb1889bd64bca9b471f84236e0c980.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/65eb1889bd64bca9b471f84236e0c980.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/65eb1889bd64bca9b471f84236e0c980.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-07T15:12:12+00:00","modified":"2020-01-17T22:44:38+00:00","filename":"65eb1889bd64bca9b471f84236e0c980.jpg","authentication":"ecc613f6735f0cac3d8b96cfe15f2e19","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_13_fl_462_003_01_o2.jpg","size":1230124,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2309,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049328874131819},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["022132"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["022132"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160728"],"TimeCreated":["022132"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"65eb1889bd64bca9b471f84236e0c980.jpg","FileDateTime":1507389015,"FileSize":1230124,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2309\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2309,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:08:02 12:04:28","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:07:28 02:21:32","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:07:28 02:21:32","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1850,"ExifImageLength":2884,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":115,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/115","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Sadan Ks.

The Country ticket seems to have gone for the Alliance candidates, and as they have not yet heard from other parts of the State, they are somewhat depressed. I think, however, that they have no idea that the Alliance ticket is so strong in other localities. But they are in fear that Robinson is elected. They have had a hot fight down here.\nI have a wedding ceremony to perform a week from today. It will be my first. It is to be in the Church.

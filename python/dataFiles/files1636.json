I have read it through and marked quite a few places for corrections.  Also I want to reread the \"Disinherited\" and compare both books as it seems to me that the German translation is shortened in parts.   From a very quick judgement the translation by Klaus Schultz is the better one.   Though he had to continue the style of Gerhard Zottcher who put his translation into Zerliner jargon that is not spoken all over the Eastern parts of the country.  \n   I definately [sic] will write my friends and relatives about the book because it has many parallels to the 20 in Germany -\n  With only those few words today may I thank you for thinking of me.

I haven't written anything lately except a 20 page paper on Flannery O'Connor which I whipped up in one day for Dr. Creed.  Needless to say, it got the C it deserved.  But I was already in my 4th month of full time work with Sears and studying was far from my mind.  I did manage to pull out that diploma, though.\n      I'm moving in a couple of weeks to another apartment here in Birmingham. How long I will be here only Atlanta knows.

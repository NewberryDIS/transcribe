Governor Evans said that the matter was now in the hands of the military authorities, and he could make no peace with them. He advised their submission to military authority, and that they should bring in their people near the fort, and await the determination of their case at Head Quarters. On being asked by one of the Chiefs how they were to subsist if they left the Buffalo grounds? the Governor told them that it was a question for them to determine. He advised them to rely on Major Wynkoop who would protect them. Colonel Chivington said very little at the Council. He told one of the Chiefs that he was the \"War Chief\" who had military command of that region, that his business was to fight - not to make peace. He recommended to them submission, and said they must help to fight such Indians as remained hostile.

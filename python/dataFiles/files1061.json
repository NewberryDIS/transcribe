sketch of the Creek Country in the years 1798 and 1799. By Col: Benj: Hawkins. The origin of the name Creek is uncertain. The tradition is, that it was given by white people, from the number of creeks & water courses in the country. The Indian name is Muscogee.* The Creeks come from the west. They have a tradition among them that there are in the fork of Red River west of the MiSsiSsippi, two mounds of earth; that at this place the CuSsetuhs, Cowetuhs, and Chickasaws, found themselves; that being distreSsed by wars with red people, they croSsed the MiSsiSsippi; directing their course eastwardly they croSsed the falls of Tal,lapoo,sa above Took,au,bat,che, settled below the falls of Chatto,ho,che and spread out from theire to Ocmulgee, O,co,nee, Savannah and down on the Sea-coast towards Charlestown. There they first saw white people & from hence they have been compelled to retire back again to their present settlements.

Throughout the whole of this country there is but little fruit of any kind; - in some of the rich flats there are fox grapes & muscadines; the small cluster grapes of the hills are destroyed by fire and the persimmon, haw & chestnut by the hatchet; - a few blackberries in the old fields; red haws in the poor? sand? hills, & strawberries thinly scattered, but not a gooseberry nor currant in the land. The traveller in passing through a country as extensive and wild as this and so much in a state of nature, expects to see game in abundance. The whole of the Creek claims (the Simenolies? inclusive) cover three hundred miles square; & it is difficult for a good hunter, in passing through it in any direction, to obtain enough for his support.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71775,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/71775","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/f0bed184046066703fcb569d598c6ec2.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/f0bed184046066703fcb569d598c6ec2.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/f0bed184046066703fcb569d598c6ec2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f0bed184046066703fcb569d598c6ec2.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T14:54:04+00:00","modified":"2020-03-31T17:28:15+00:00","filename":"f0bed184046066703fcb569d598c6ec2.jpg","authentication":"6843cdfa68dfee152260b8a47b1b3482","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL10_FL001_00008_o2.jpg","size":507017,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2203,"compression_ratio":0.042620080361796},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["`"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["075519+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["`"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["075519+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[" `"],"DateCreated":["20120621"],"TimeCreated":["075519+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f0bed184046066703fcb569d598c6ec2.jpg","FileDateTime":1522680831,"FileSize":507017,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2203\"","Height":2203,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2203,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:21:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3890},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:21 07:55:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:21 07:55:19","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":69,"SubSecTimeOriginal":69,"SubSecTimeDigitized":69,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2203,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1061,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1061","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The Towns - with a description of their position & the lands of their neighborhood.

In the season for melons the Indians of this town & Foosee hat,che, show, in a particular manner, their hospitality to all travellers, by calling to them, inviting them to their huts or shades of their trees and giving them excellent melons & the best fare they possess. Opposite the town house in the fields is a Conic? Mound of earth 30 feet diameter, 10 feet high; & large peachtrees at several places. At the lower end of the fields on the left bank of a fine little Creek, Se,cau,suh, is a pretty little village of Coo,le,me? people finely situated on a rising ground. The land up this creek is waving pine forest.  7. E,cun,hut,ke, from e,cun,nau, earth, & hut,ke, white, called by the traders white ground. This little town is just below Coa,loo,me?, on the same side of the river, and five or six miles above Sam bel,loh?, a large fine creek which has its source in the pine hills to the N: and its whole course through broken pine hills. It appears to be a never failing stream & fine for mills.

The fields are below the town.  The river is 120 yards wide, with a deep steady current from the falls.  These are over a rough coarse rock, forming some islands of rock, which force the water into two narrow channels in time of low water - one on each side of the river - in the whole about 90 feet wide - that on the right is 60 feet wide, with a perpendicular fall of 12 feet.

It has been used with effect & much to the approbation of a numerous family, who have more than doubled their crop of corn & potatoes; and who begin to know how to turn their corn to account by giving it to their hogs.  This Micco & his family have hogs cattle & horses, and begin to be very attentive to them.

and manners of the Sioux Indians, obtained through the Reverend Samuel W. Pond, Missionary of the A.B.C.F.M. near the mouth of the St Peter's - By I.P. Evans, M.D\nTheir Worship\nThey ascribe the creation of all things to a great Spirit; but know nothing of God as he is revealed in the Bible. - They believe the soul of man exists after the death of the body; but are ignorant of a future state of rewards & punishments.  The worship many objects, both animate and inanimate; - among those objects are the following - The Sun, Moon and Stars; Trees, Grass and Stones; Snakes, Spiders & the river Tortoise; also Thunder, which they suppose to be a large bird.  Imaginary objects also enter into the list of their deities.  To all of these they offer sacrifice.

But it would be hard to seperate the principle from necessity.  To bestow food & shelter on those who do not stand in need, would hardly be hospitality - rather it would be prodigality, - a quality quite foreign to nobleness.  The deductions to be drawn from this method or argument above, seem to differ from the conclusion of the reverend gentleman to who I am indebted for these sketches; \"but\", says my informant, \"Should one attempt to support himself independently of the rest, they would all be, from time to time, exposed to starvation: - The precarious supply afforded by the chase, - not infrequently unsuccessful in hunting - various accidents which deprive them of, or prevent them from procuring, food, serve to perpetuate the exercise of hospitality.

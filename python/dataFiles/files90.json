Sister Matty I mean Martha Scott) is making up an exhibition for the benefit of the organ of Centenary M. E. Church; our Sunday school is in about the same order as when you left.  My school lessons are harder now than it ever was before.  The first I say is Rhetoric, from half past nine till half past ten, next I review with the second class section which recites from twenty minutes of eleven till half past; when we come up from recess the first class section recites till twenty minutes past one; then Algebra till two o-clock; seven minutes after one we are dismissed.  Sometimes I feel very much discouraged having the same routine from week to week, but the best way to do is to do the best you can today, and let tomorrow take care of itself.  All of our class are well.  I suppose you have heard that Miss Wood has left us on account of the death of her father; it was a sore misfortune to us to have both teachers leave us at one time, but we had to do the best we could.  Our exercise for tomorrow is, to write a description of what we saw today, in the form of a letter and give it to Mrs Warren to be corrected.  All the family are well and send their \"well wishes\" to you.  We have a holiday today, it being Washingtons birthday.  Please excuse this short letter as I haven't prepared my lesson for tomorrow.\n  Please write to me as soon as possible.  I haven't forgotten your New Years present, the cushion is very useful to me, and I hope the advice is useful to me now and will be more so in the future.  I suppose Mrs. Warren has told you that she is teaching our Rhetoric class.\n\nYour affectionate exscholar Cornelius\nP.S.

If northern man cannot go there and take a farm because they are averse to holding slaves and if he works his farm himself he is looked upon with scorn by his neighbor who works his farm by slaves he is constantly taunted with being from white trash and it annoys him so that he leaves in disgust and moves to some country where honest labor is not looked upon as a disgrace by the nabobs of the South. This is the only reason why this beautiful and fertile state is only settled along the river shores slavery is not a paying institution there consequently there is no danger of its spreading north as many of our northern people are afraid of, nature has erected barriers against slavery more potent than any that could be enacted by Congress, as soon as slavery is abolished in Missouri then will she take her stand along with her sister states the richest and proudest of all.

We went down to the Missouri river, and took passage on board of a ferry boat for Belmont, a village on the Kansas side about five miles from St Joe. The Missouri river here is about four hundred yards wide, the water is very yellow being a mixture of about one half part of sand and water, it has a very rapid current running at the rate of about ten miles an hour. In some places it is very deep but the sand bars are all movable which makes it very dangerous to navigation.

This night we enjoyed ourselves hugely, had a good meal of stewed rabbits and prairie chickens which we killed during the day, and as the evening was cold we built a rousing fire got out our buffalo skins spread them on the grass all round the fire, and stretched ourselves at full length to rest our weary limbs.

occurrance the inflicting of immediate punishment which is the invariable rule of our society on the plains the offender being caught is instantly tried by a jury picked up on the road the witnesses both for and against are heard and if not proved he is discharged forthwith, if guilty he will be punished according to the enormity of the offense, if for horse or mule stealing or murder, he is hung to the nearest tree, if a less grevious crime he is tied to a tree or wagon wheel and receives from ten to one hundred lashes on the bare back the amount to be fixed by the jury.

This afternoon we also met the Pony Express returning from San Francisco he passed us like the wind and we could not get a single word of news we camped tonight on the Blue River again. The following day at noon we parted from this beautiful little stream having traveled fifty miles along its banks we now struck out on the broad open prairie on  the old military road to California this road has been well worn by travel it is about one hundred feet broad and cut down from the constant rise about one foot its whole width. The whole immigration to and from California in 1848 and 1850 was over this highway it is now a splendid road the peculiar nature of the soil rendering it when exposed to the sun as hard as brick without any assistance from man. It is far ahead of the smoothest Mac Adanized roads in the States a wagon loaded with six to making no impression whatever on its flinty surface tonight we had to camp on the open prairie without wood or water the prospect was not all all encouraging and we could not help contrasting it with our abundance of the night previous of the Little Blue. We pitched our tent and camped on the side of the road picketed our horses and downharted and unhappy we threw ourselves on our blankets to find some rest. This was the first time I began to think of home with many regrets for leaving it all the hardships and difficulties of our undertaking then rose before my mind vividly and I could not help thinking

curious is it that no sooner did we realize a small share of hard life than we commence to complain of what we brought [unclear] ourselves knowingly and expecting even worse than what we then experienced. The next morning we commenced our journey again about noon we came to a pool of dirty water we camped here for dinner refreshed ourselves and started again on our journey that night we camped within ten miles of the Platt River but had to spend another night without wood or water we however felt more cheereful tonight at the near prospect of relief. In the morning we rose very early and were again on the road in about three hours we struck the great Plat River at grand island ten miles below Fort Karney we were so starved out for want of cooked victals that we determined to spend the remainder of the day and night here.

We feasted gloriously today on baked bread stewed rabbit and plenty of tea and coffee we made up for the privations of the three previous days.

The Fort consists of about twenty houses occupied as barracks officers quarters and a Post Office enclosing a square about one acre with twelve six pounder guns mounted three on each side of the square what they were placed there for I could not imagine as they could not fire them off without knocking down the buildings. It is very curious why they selected such a position for a fort it has no natural advantages whatever there isnot any shlter from an enemy no elevation to the ground and it is a mile away from the river and they have not even got a mud enclosure around it and I should think in case of assault the insiders would have no advantage over the besiegers. We were not allowed to stop in the immediate neighborhood of the \"Fort\" the rules being strict that no one should camp within two miles. I staid behind to get letters I found some from home tho first I received since leaving we were as eager to get news from home as if we had been away years instead of only two weeks. I read my letters found all well at home and then went out to the square to see the drill there was two companys United States Regulars find appearing men but sadly deficient of clothing almost every man was out at the knees or elbows even the offices looked shabby I saw them trying to get gloves on which required a great deal of skill they were full of holes and the fingers would not go out in the right place.

After our supper we looked up good quarters for our poor starved horses we found a place where the grass was splendid and tied them there for the night leaving a watch to look out for their safety we then lay down and had a comfortable nights sleep.

It might with justness be called an orchard in the centre was an open space of about ten acres all around it were rows of wild apple tree commonly called \"Crab\" growing as regularly and even distances apart as if planted by the hand of man indeed I never saw straighter rows of trees in the best kept gardens of our city it was a most singular freak of nature.

directions it seemed as if the very hills sprang suddenly to life, on the came rushing at a gallop up to our very wagons we then presented our rifles and they suddenly wheeled and turned away out of

We felt that something must be done and done soon or we should be hemmed in without hope of escape it would be the hight of madness to remain in our present position so we resolved to leave it or provoke the Indians to immediate attack, so ten of our members brought in our horses harnessed them up to the wagons and made all ready for a start the other forty still kept the rifles on the cock and presented at the foe.

Indians appeared to be very friendly and well disposed towards us eager to trade skins and moccasins for anything we might offer them.  We camped this night on a prairie dog city about ten miles square they are a queer looking little animal about the size of a cat fat and plump looking, they are very numerous, all that great extent of ground is full of holes about one yard apart, it is very hard to kill one of those little creatures they are very shy and at first appearance of an enemy in their vicinity their heels twinkle in the air, and they disappear in their holes in an instant, then commences a defeaning chorous of voices all barking furiously.  It is very hard to get a shot at one of them and if you succeed in killing it the others will pull it into the hole before you can lay hold of it we used to count it a great feat to capture one of them it was only for the sport as the flesh is unfit to eat.  The most remarkable thing about these little things is the mixture of races in their family, the dog, the owl and the rattlesnake all living peacefully in the same hole I have seen them all go down together many hundred times I think it is a very strange freak of nature.  In this part of the country were a great many rabbits called here Jackass Rabbits but I am told by people that are well informed on the matter that they are the regular old country hare they are very large we succeeded in killing some and the flesh was excellent, there is a knack in hunting them which if you do not know you could not kill one in a month when one starts up before you you must stand still and then he will stand still also ang sit on his hind legs and face right towards you if he is too far off for a shot advance slowly towards him in a straight line if you go zigzag he will know it at once and start off in this way you can come close enough to shoot him if he does take the alarm and start stop still

Mr. Collyer formed one of the court he was prosecuting Attorney elected by the people.  I must say that the court there with the exception of having the sanction of the government is legitemate the officers being regularly elected by the people they are sworn to do justice to all men.  We strolled some further round the city went down and called upon the editor of the Rocky Mountain News one of the daily papers published here and had him register our names under the head of late arrivals from the States.  We purchased six copies of his paper at ten cents a copy to send home to our friend we chatted pleasantly with him for an hour or so giving him all the latest news from the States.  We then strolled round and visited some of their hotels they looked very fine for such a remote place some of them were well furnished and spread good tables at the Pacific Hotel we had supper, after that we went out again on the street to pass the time till the trial was to come off.

their pockets till it was all gone and then they cheerfully go to work for more. The next day our friend William Clancy? arrived in town he was just from the gold regions of Gregory and gave us a very gloomy picture indeed of gold mining and our prospects he advised us to sell our goods (we could then get an eneromous price for them) realize all the money we could, and start back to the States. We would not consider such a proposition for a moment he then said if we were bound to go to the mountains that the best place for us was to go the Arkansas Diggings, about one hundred and eighty miles from Denver. He said it was a new discovery reported very rich and the immigration towards that place was not very numerous as yet so that day we made up our minds to start on the next morning for the Arkansas. We made all necessary preparations and started at daylight for the mountains about fifteen miles distant. the gigantic mass of earth seemed to be raising out of the earth every step we took towards it by noon we had made only eight miles and when we camped it seemed as far off as it was in the morning its tremendous peaks covered with eternal snow hung threathiningly over our heads and were in sight hundreds of miles north and south. We stopped only a short time for dinner and took another start the country here was slighting undulating but not enough to be called hilly and preserved the same aspect to the very base of the mountains. I think that this is very remarkable for in the neighborhood of most mountains the country for fifty miles from their base is very rough and hilly but here it was nice meadow land to the very mountain

laughing by us. It was a most magnificent sight, the setting sun tinged those gloomy hights with his golden yellow the white snow seemingly about to fall upon our heads, the slopes of the mountains rising ther above thir covered with the green pine and fir tree and on the other hand lay stretched the boundless prairie that we had just traversed. Denver City was plainly in sight although fifteen miles distant, the Plat river could be seen like a silver thread winding its course along the boosom? of the prairie. We pitched our camp staked out our horses got ready some supper, and then had leisure to view the stupendous wonders, around us. It was a glorious moonlight night the air soft and warm as summer, and the mountains looked grand and wierd? looking, the scene would almost inspire one with superstition and dread. We built a large fire sat around it we did not need it as the air was warm enough but we always considered it more sociable? the prairie traveler considers it lonly not to have a fire even the hottest days in summer. We sat and talked till late the night each one related all that he had heard or read unclear that huge frowning pile before us. some told of dangers hardships and privations, of parties starting to cross them and they were never heard of afterwards. stores of wild animals and hostile Indians, till we got our imagination worked up to that pitch that we could almost imagine that those gloomy piles were peopled by evil and malignant spirits. Still if it was so it would not deter people from going there in search of the shining ore which scarcely ever brings happiness to its possessor. At a late hour in the night we lay down by our camp fire to sleep but it did not visit my eyelids for some hours after I could not close my eyes on the beautiful appearance of those mountains.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64637,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64637","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:16+00:00","modified":"2020-04-11T18:57:40+00:00","filename":"334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg","authentication":"aa86594de0feef8c39d6d615c702fc91","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00020_o2.jpg","size":849460,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2832,"compression_ratio":0.055546400920695},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102538+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102538+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102538+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg","FileDateTime":1521817599,"FileSize":849460,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2832\"","Height":2832,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2832,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:23 09:59:44","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":312},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":966,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3634},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:10:04 10:25:38","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:10:04 10:25:38","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":22,"SubSecTimeDigitized":22,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2832,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":995,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/995","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"39 I had a refreshing nights sleep and awoke in the morning about daybreak the rest of the boys were already up and busy preparing to make a start in to the mountains, but we remarked?

By this time we had all things prepared and commenced to climb the old Rockys?. we entered through a defile or mountain gulley the dried up bed of a stream there was still a small rivulet running in its lowest parts on either hand rose towering precipices that would make the eyes ache to look to their summits. The ascent was very gradual for the first two miles but a steady incline upward, at this point the mountains presented a most sublime view huge rocked piled ther above their? thousands of feet above our heads threathening at the slightest jar or puff of wind to rush resistlessly down to our destruction. Along by our feet rushed a small mountain torrent its water cold and clear as crystal refreshed our lips many times during that weary ascent, we continued on till about noon and made probably six miles on our journey. As soon as we entered the mountains we lost altogether our view of the plains our compass was the only means of knowing in what direction we were going our main course so far was southwest. At the spot where we camped for dinner there was scarcely room for our wagons unclear stand the mountains rose on both sides of us almost perpindicular the road made in the bottom was only just wide enough for one wagon. After a rest of a couple of hours we commenced to climb again the road commenced to get very rough and stony and some places very steep hills to climb so very steep that we would have to get four teams of horses to pull us up.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64638,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64638","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7283590fba7362371ba1ae152f52ecdc.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7283590fba7362371ba1ae152f52ecdc.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7283590fba7362371ba1ae152f52ecdc.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7283590fba7362371ba1ae152f52ecdc.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:17+00:00","modified":"2020-04-11T19:09:19+00:00","filename":"7283590fba7362371ba1ae152f52ecdc.jpg","authentication":"6026a020448cbc57778848aa7ce53c4c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00021_o2

It was very slow going now and shortly before sunset finding a level spot of ground we camped for the night we made only three miles this afternoon making seven crossed out nine in all and the hardest days journey we had yet performed. I was so fitugued? and wearied out that I threw myself full length upon the grass and fell asleep before supper. If this was to be a sample of a mountain road we were led to believe it was a good mountain road if so Lord help us when we got where there was no road, it was enough to make a man despair to think of having to travel one hundred and eighty miles of road worse than that, for we were informed that the first part of the road was the best. We got our supplies and then gathered some dry pine logs which were here in abundance to keep up a good fire for the night although only an hour after dark and nine miles into the mountains the indications were that we would have some frost before morning. So we started a huge fire brought out our buffalo skins and blankets and fixed our sleeping places for the night, we were obliged to sleep in the open air for we could not find level space enough to spread our tent. we pickitted our horses set the watch and things being all right lay down and took our first snooze on the Rocky Mountain. No one who has no experienced it can imagine the delicious feeling that comes over the weary traveller who has unclear up steep mountainsides all day when he throws himself down to repose at night on his harce? bed with nothing but the sky for a covering. I have lain on my back for hours watching those numberless stars ever changing their positions, the moon sailing brightly through milk white clouds, the beautiful \"milky way\" showing like a belt of silver across the sky, in this place it shows clearer and brighter than in any other part of the world, tall spires and peaks raising their snow capped peaks heavenward in all directions and on every side it is here in such a place as this that the heart turns to admiration at the skill of the wonderful creator of all these wonders.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64639,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64639","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/037ee6e7a62b215d542ea783a1be2c1a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/037ee6e7a62b215d542ea783a1be2c1a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/037ee6e7a62b215d542ea783a1be2c1a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/037ee6e7a62b215d542ea783a1be2c1a.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:18+00:00","modified":"2020-04-14T19:43:46+00:00","filename":"037ee6e7a62b215d542ea783a1be2c1a.jpg","authentication":"d9446ba275057404cbd4e16b2a91243f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00021_o2.jpg","size":869607,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

journeying about four days more the country became so mountanious that we were forced to make two parts of our loads, we built a small hut in the woods by the roadside put in about half our provisions and leaving two of our party in charge we started once more on our journey. We were now on the most elevated range of the mountains all around us was clouds and snow the air was very opprefsive after climbing a small hill you would pant like a sheep on a hot day the hight of this dividing range is about eighteen thousand feet. In the afternoon after leaving our companions we commenced to decend very rapidly we continued going down all the afternoon in the evening we reached the Platt River which we found to be the last of our decending. The river here is thirty miles in a straight line from the outside of the mountains and about a mile higher it is a huge mountain torrent at this time roaring and tumbling tearing trees and rocks along in its headlong course yet we camped on its banks having the cheerlefs prospect of having to ford it early in the morning. I never camped yet during the whole trip with more complete lownefs of spirit we had left part of our company behind probably we would never see them again we met parties returning from the mountains who gave unfavorable accounts of the mines they also reported that the Indians were showing signs of hostility and gave it as their opinion that they would mafsacre all the white men on the mountains add to all these the knowledge that dangers and difficulties were increasing every day on the road we began to think that we would have to abandon our tea? wagons and pack our provisions through. On a cold mountain side cold and shivering no covering from the night air it was as cheerlefs a prospect as any one can imagine. At that time if I was at home with the same experience acquired I think nothing could induce me to leave the comforts of home for the dangers and difficulties of gold hunting.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64640,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64640","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:19+00:00","modified":"2020-04-16T21:16:37+00:00","filename":"b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg","authentication":"bfe6635ce7efa0758627dde0ed8d0b13","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00022_o2 copy.jpg","size":853269,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2829,"compression_ratio":0.055854640430462},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102630+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102630+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102630+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg","FileDateTime":1521817599,"FileSize":853269,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2829\"","Height":2829,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2829,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:23 09:59:45","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":312},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":966,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3541},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:10:04 10:26:30","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:10:04 10:26:30","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":65,"SubSecTimeDigitized":65,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2829,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":995,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/995","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"42\nIn the morning we got up very early to prepare for crofsing the river we had breakfast before daylight sometimes the sun would raise over the hills before ten O clock.

We got the first wagon acrofs in glorious style and the steep hill on the other side before the horses could be stopped we had to then go back again with the teams for the other three wagons they were all brought over in the same manner.

We crossed the same river no lefs than five times on that day and twice on the next day making nine times in all the sufferings and hardships we endured on each occasion of crossing cannot be

now commenced to decend for we stood on a mountain unclear about one thousand feet higher than the plane the decent was very abrupt and we had to tie three of our wheels to keep the wagon from pitching over upon the horses in about two hours we reached the park and found that it was even lovlier looking than we had imagined while looking upon it from the mountain top. The grafs was soft and green as a meadow in our own prairie state nice little brooks clear as crystal filled with brook trout sporting gayly before our eyes crofsed and recrofsed each other all over the surface of the plain everything looking so invitingly comfortable we made up our minds to camp there for the night We picketed out our horses and for the first time in four weeks they had good grafs we made a spear and caught some fine brook trout for supper that evening we had such a supper as might make an epicure envious of our enjoyment fish flesh and fowl the kinds being the trout venison and buffalo meat with some bacon to supply the grease for cooking and then we had some ducks for the dessert we made some warm biscuit and tea and it was really the most comfortable meal we had on the journey. This night we did not suffer any from cold we were sheltered from the winds by the mountains in the morning we started once more on a smooth level road in continued very good until noon when we came to a swamp or morafs similar to those in Illinois it was about a fourth of a mile acrofs and dreadful hard pulling sometimes I thought we must sink and go under the mud we held on bravely and at last got acrofs safe we then journeyed on and arrived at Tarryall an hour before sunset this is one hundred miles from Denver and eighty miles from the place we entered them it took us just ten days to come that distance. We were now at the mining ground the goal of all our hopes and expectations and when we came to look at the prospects it seemed as if we were as far as ever from realizing the acquiring of gold which had brought us so long a journey.

It was a pretty lively town there was a large tent big enough for to contain Dan Roe? \"Big Show\" with all kinds of gambling apparatus there and a large crowd always present pursuing the delusive phantom Another place you could see a Mexican leading fifteen or twenty jacks and bawling out at the top of his voice for some freight to carry over to the different gulches. Miners were to be met here in crowds rough looking as if they had lived in those mountains for twenty years some were coming to town to spend their pile of dust and others were you could tell it from their looks disapointed and were going in search of new diggings the latter were by far the greater number and their personal appearance was in most cases wretched in the extreme. I think gold seeking is the most uncertain and precarious businefs in the world a man is tempted and risks so much that he would not do in following other pursuits. If he has a claim in a remote place far away from any place where he could purchase provisions he will be tempted to stay working on that claim from day to day until his last mouthfull of provisions is exhausted then without anything to eat he will undertake a journey of twenty or thirty miles over mountains covered with snow and sometimes by paths unknown to him depending on luck only to keep him from starvation.

was now growing dark so I had to leave farther observation for tomorrow and go back to camp, our camp was on the banks of the Tarryall river the waters of which was very yellow caused by the miners washing their dirt in the stream about two miles above. This night pafsed away pleasantly like the one before it not cold in the least, in the morning I took an early start up Tarryall Gulch to see the mining operations we pafsed through the town climbed some very rugged hills and then found ourselves at the mines the first time any of our party had ever seen gold washed. The procefs is very simple all that is necefsary is to turn the bed of the river which is done by making a tail ditch and running the water in a new channel then you remove the boulder stones from the bed of the stream sometimes a work of great labor some of them being so large that you must break them with a sledge hammer and remove them in pieces after getting them clean you then have to strip the earth off down to the bed rock sometimes it is only two feet and sometimes it may be twelve or fourteen . The dirt laying close to the rock is what is called the pay dirt  you will have to shovel that into your sluice a long box about from fifty to five hundred feet long with a small stream of water running through it and riffles placed near the end charged with quicksilver to catch the gold. The earth is shoveled in from the gulch runs down the whole lenght of the sluice carried along by the force of the water when it gets to the rifles the lighter particles will roll over the riffles but the gold being the heaviest will drop down and amalgamate with the quicksilver which is placed at the bottom of the riffles to receive it. You may keep shoveling all day then you take out your riffles squezze your quicksilver in a rag and the gold will seperate from it you then take your quicksilver and put it into a bottle it only loses twenty per cent by using what remains then is gold having only a small alloy of black sand.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64646,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64646","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:25+00:00","modified":"2020-06-15T21:26:33+00:00","filename":"0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg","authentication":"34ae770a123d47ba18bf1392218e567b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00026_o2

The gulch was about two miles long extending almost to the summit of the Blue Range of mountains near the upper end they had no water and had to carry the dirt about one fourth of a mile to wash it evidently it was richer than that at the lower part out of two tons of dirt as much as two men could carry in a day they generally washed about twenty dollars.

In the morning we were up early and got our teams ready and dispatched them along with two drivers for our comrades and provisions which we had left behind.

This night we had a shelter to get under some miners seeing us about camping out for the night very kindly asked us to sleep in their shanty an offer which we very gladly accepted as the night was very cold we had comparatively a comfortable sleep and arose in the morning fresh as if we had not climbed the highest range of the Rocky Mountains on the previous day. Mining was going on extensively in this place on the Blue River alone there was about one thousand claims taken, none of them any good remained unoccupied. The way the mining was carried on was by sluicing, there was first a tail ditch dug into which the river was turned then they removed the boulders and stripped the earth in the bed of the stream down to the bed rock. Then they made a sluice a box having three sides made of pine boards bought in this place at a cost of two hundred dollars per thousand feet. the top of the sluice was then inserted into the stream and about one inch deep of water allowed to run through it, all being now ready they shovel the pay dirt into the sluice all worthless matter is carried off the gold remains at the bottom of the sluice I described minutely in a previous page of this the process of collecting and saving gold. There was a log fort built on this gulch for the protection of the whites in case the Indians should commence hostilities they were assuming a very threatening attitude being collected about five

We had a jolly night of it some eight or ten merry fellows all as merry light hearted and free from care as if they were pursuing a fireside occupation at home instead of incountering all the dangers sufferings and hardships of a miners life. They had not provisions for more then two days and if a heavy snow storm set in the meantime it might be some week before they could get over to the Blue for a supply I thought it recklesness of the grossest kind they did not feel very uneasy but said that if it did snow they would get out of it in some way.

In the morning we started on a prospecting tour carrying a shovel pick axe and gold pan we started up the gulch towards the snowy range taking provisions for two days. We traveled about two hours and then coming to what we considered a promising looking place we cleared off a space and dug a small hole down as far as the bed rock which was here about five feet deep. we then took up the \"pay dirt\" the earth next the bed rock and washed a pan full or about a pick of clay.  The process of washing is to carry it to a stream of running water sink your pan holding it in your hands all the time and gently tilting it from side to side the current carries off all the sand and clay and light particles leaving the heavier ones or the black and a composition of iron and the gold if there is any by using a magnet you can then seperate the sand from the gold. You may think that the gold can escape as well as the other particles but it is not so take an experienced gold washer and grain of dust weighing only one cent into a bushel of earth mix it up thouroughly and he can wash that heap of dirt and find that small piece of gold, it may seem incredible but you must understand that gold is so heavy that water cannot carry it along. I have seen a nugget weighing two penny weights put into a mountain torrent running ten miles an hour and although it was placed upon a flat board the water could not carry it along or overturn it. In our prospect this time we found a pretty good color but not rich enough to pay us five dollars a day you must wash from a claim with a gold pan about three cents to the pan earth that will yield

We camped out that night about ten miles from where we started we built a shanty of pine limbs built a good fire in front and just at dark we were as snug and comfortable a party of gold hunters as could be found on the mountains. One of our party had killed two jack ass rabbits during the day we dressed and stewed them with some beacon had some slap jacks as we called them and made a first rate supper at that time I thought if I had all the wealth and luxuries the world could bestow that I never would wish for a better meal it was all that any poor hungry miner could wish for. We sat a long time at our meal the laugh and song went round we were as merry and light hearted a party of miners as could be found that night on the mountains. About midnight we rolled in our blankets the bright fire shining all around us we slept soundly the remainder of the night and roused early in the morning had some breakfast and commenced again prospecting we had no better success than on the previous day so we concluded to give it up and take the back trail to camp again.

At about ten A.M. we came to the summit of the range after that it was a descent for about ten miles we encountered no difficulties worth speaking of and arrived at our camp at Tarryall about an hour before sunset. The remainder of our party had got back safe bringing all the provisions with them we were now relieved of that cause of anxiety and could devote all our energies to the finding of a profitable claim. I staid at camp a day to recruit after the fatigues of the journey we held a  council of war concerning future movements of our journey we concluded that on the next morning we would start off prospecting in all directions two together and leave one to mind the camp and horses. it was safe enough to leave them in charge of one because there was plenty of friends in our neighborhood who would lend him assistance if needed This afternoon was a very busy time preparing our packs for the journey we were not going to take mules with us any more we found from experience that they were very   inconvienient the best way is to take only what you absolutely need and carry that on your shoulder The equipment of a prospecting party is rather novel and when in full dress resembles a

We were bewildered that way for a long time finally we concluded that we would no longer follow their devious windings but pursue a straight course west by the compass I knew that the Arkensas lay west and I would leave it to fate to bring us out in the right place. We now struck out boldly facing the steep hills and going as fast as we could it was an awful wild looking place the pine trees were growing to thick and so many of them were laying down blown by the hurricanes which frequently sweep over the mountains we had the greatest difficulty in getting forward to make matters worse we were now getting into the snow regions and in climbing a hill we would sometimes slip back again.

accident and undoubtedably had died from starvation his leg being broken and not having any food the paper stated that his gun lay near him also some cooking utensils pick axe shovel and a gold pan there was a few dollars in money in his pockets with some papers telling his name all of which his friends could have by applying to a certain house in Denver City. It was a most horrible fate the poor fellow met living there probably some days suffering all the pangs of hunger cold and pain he must have died a hundred deaths in anticipation before he was released from suffering it was a more cruel death than the greatest tyrant of old ever prepared for his enimies. That spot was no resting place for us that night I could not stop there if I was forced to sleep in the snow all night we recrossed the torrent but it was growing so very dark we dared not travel any farther there was some tremendous precipices all around us so we camped about one hundred yards from the grave camped on the cold bare ground. We gathered some pine logs made a rousing fire cooked some supper but it was done in silence.

his head the enerormous bunch of bone or horns protects him from all injuries I have seen one of their horns at Tarryall that weighed eighty pounds. they are very shy and it is a rare thing to kill one of them, the flesh is good tasting like wild mutton. about the middle of the afternoon we got terribly hungry if a prairie wolf could be captured we would not have stood on ceremony about feasting on his carcass. but then it we were driven to extremity the mule would have to be sacrificed to preserve life but we had neither of us spoken of such an alternative but I know it was for that purpose we dragged the poor animal after us he was so famished that if we would let him he would lay down never to raise again I found that by tightening the belt which I wore around my body that it eased the pangs of hunger all prairie travelers will admit the fact by pulling up the strap another hole every time that hunger pinches you will husband your strength and not so soon have to surrender to the knawing pangs of hunger. Shortly after this time we had climbed an unusual high hill and just as we got to the top we beheld a sight that drove terror into our hearts away down in the valley beneath us was a large  encampment of Indians. before we left the camp we had rumers of hostilities between the Utes and the whites. any how in the most peaceable time it would be dangerous to get into their camp away off in those wild regions where they were perfectly well aware they could commit any outrage they pleased on white men without any fears of retaliation, if we fell into their hands they would surely rob and perhaps murder us.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64663,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64663","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/ca5afeaecdefb5ff48123be4a40e474c.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/ca5afeaecdefb5ff48123be4a40e474c.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/ca5afeaecdefb5ff48123be4a40e474c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ca5afeaecdefb5ff48123be4a40e474c.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:41+00:00","modified":"2020-06-24T16:10:35+00:00","filename":"ca5afeaecdefb5ff48123be4a40e474c.jpg","authentication":"462d73ecec7f9ff34d3bbfe449a89d8b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00035_o2.jpg","size":925297,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

two hours after starting as we were walking slowly and sorrowfully along a plain of about a mile in extent we suddenly came across the trail without any indication of being in its neighborhood untill we stood on it  Although we were glad to find it it was not what we expected by my calculation I thought we must come out some where on the Arkensas River and though we were on the trail it could not relieve our hunger, however we marched along and felt a good deal more courage anyhow. We kept on till about noon when suddenly a party of men hove in sight just as soon as I became convinced that they were white men I suddenly grew weak and had to lay down by the road side untill they came up. When they came up they knew without asking what was the matter they could see by one look that we were almost famished they spoke to us kindly and without asking any unneccessary questions at once commenced preparing something for us to eat.

alarmed and thought that the Indians had commenced an attack we hurried quickly towards the shouting when we soon found out that the cause of the excitement was the reported discovery of new and rich diggings about five miles distant and across the snowy range. A party had just formed and were starting immediately for the gold field we joined them instantly packed our mule and set out in company with about fifty others at twelve at night to cross one of the highest and most dangerous peaks of the mountains. And without any available information as to the value of the discovery. We kept on over rocks through tangled forests and over slippery heaps of ice and snow the night was intensly dark and every few moments a fearful scream announced that some of the adventurers had fallen over rocks or stones and were hurt several of them got severe bruises on that night. The excitement grew wilder as we proceeded a calm looker on would have pronounced it a party of mad men as we neared the place their eagerness rose to a frenzy every man shouted and yelled at the top of his voice. Just as the gray light of morning was coming on we reached the gulch and each one proceeded immediately to stake off his claim of one hundred feet.

This time we did not feel the least alarmed we had a good rousing fire and I always heard that wolves were afraid of fire. we prepared our rifles and revolvers to have a crack at them if they came near enough.

At this the whole pack set up a tremendous howling and immediately commenced devouring the dead wolves we reloaded as quick as possible fired another volley and brought down two more of the dirty pack as fast as they were shot the others set upon and devoured them. We now felt in a very unpleasant position the pack attracting reinforcements every minute, and if they got very numerous they would get emboldened and probably might attack us.

After breakfast we started again on our road. we knew the camp was not more than eight or ten miles distant. we had to cross the Platt once more but made sure this time of securing the mule before he got near the river. About noon we came in sight of the camp when we came near all the boys were standing around but they did not recognize us untill we spoke to them. we made a most woful appearance when we started out we had a gay suit of miners dress only two weeks passed and we came back our cloths hanging in shreds from our backs, our hats in ribbons and scarcely affording us any protection from the sun. our boots were left behind more than twenty miles back and our feet intirely bare and all cut from the sharp jagged rocks. They had a thousand  questions to ask us but before we would answer any of them we made them get us something to eat and a change of clothing we did not have one for two weeks. It was almost as good as renewing life when we got new cloths on I felt as if it was worth going through all those hardships for the real enjoyment of that hour. We told them our story and they gave us a history of their adventures since they had been to all the diggings within fifty miles of the place and spent a great deal of time prospecting with no better

The place was situated on a small stream at Tarryall that run through the park and into the Platt River.

Some of us went to work making sluices and the rest commenced opening the claim we had first to make a tail ditch and turn the bed of the stream and it being a large stream it was a very laborious job. we got it turned in three days and then commenced digging in the centre of the original bed of the stream.

We journeyed only four or five miles and then halted for the night on the banks of a clear pleasant stream. our whole party consisted of six persons and three wagons they were all friends and acquantances of ours, and we had agreed to travel together. we had a very lonesome night of it could not help feeling lonesome for our friends that we had left behind. The next day we got out of the park and I felt as though we were going to encounter hardships as soon as we lost sight of its fair level surface.

night we camped with some immigrants that were going to the mountains. they gave us some news from the states, and also the more fearful tidings of an Indian massacre a large party of Cheyanne had killed a party of twenty immigrants just on the borders of the mountains. Whether true or false the information alarmed us greatly as we should have to take the same pass in getting down from the mountains. but they also told us that there was a new route found out by a place called Bradford and that by taking that road we would have a better road and perhaps encounter no Indians. There was no other alternative but going ahead now so we  plucked up all our courage and again started. the teams travelled so slow now that we had a good opportunity for hunting I took some pretty long rambles from the road sometimes I would strike into a valley walk up it three or four miles and then on returning to the road would have  to cross three or four mountain peaks. The game I usually got was the large species of rabbit called the jackass rabbit those who seen the hare in the old country pronounce it to be identical with the jackass rabbit on one occasion I got a good turkey he was very fat and made a capital meal. Although we had no loads we did not seem to get over the road any faster than at our coming in. our horses were so weak that after  climbing a hill we had to let them rest for a long time our average traveling was about ten miles a day. The Platt crossing was somewhat improved so that we experienced no difficulty in crossing. I think if there was such obstacles there as when we first crossed that our teams would have never accomplished it and would have been swept away and drowned in the attempt,","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64686,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64686","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/481015d30dd79aba1c2988f47c17b17e.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/481015d30dd79aba1c2988f47c17b17e.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/481015d30dd79aba1c2988f47c17b17e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/481015d30dd79aba1c2988f47c17b17e.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:08:02+00:00","modified":"2020-05-18T18:54:10+00:00","filename":"481015d30dd79aba1c2988f47c17b17e.jpg","authentication":"ffcf4db1ca660116067fabe78d3e5f4c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00047_o2

Fill them full of stories about wonderful discoveries and they will believe it all because it agrees with their inclinations but tell them about the dangers and difficulties all the privations hunger cold and fatigue they will have to undergo, of working up to their knees in cold ice water, they will only laugh at you and will not give credit to it. After crossing the Platt the last time we struck in to the new road called the Bradford road. it was an improvement on any road that I had yet traveled on in the mountains they had a large gang of men to work grading it. they charged us two dollars toll for travelling it.

There being pretty good grass near by in a valley we camped for dinner and to rest our horses before commencing the desent for going down such a steep hill is very distressing on horses. We chained three wheels on the wagon before starting down hill and then the wagon kept pushing hard on the horses the road was made on the top of a sharp hill by taking off a few shovelfulls of of the top and so making it flat for about six feet. If you got over the sides you would fall down a steep precipice hundreds of feet and of course dashed to pieces it was a dangerous business to sit in the wagon and guide the horses we all tried it in turns but grew frightened and gave it up at last we had to take hold and lead the horses by the heads. We could see far down below us a  crowd of teams waiting get past about half way down there was a place for turning out and we having the road first they had to wait till we got past. It was hard work enough to get down but I pity the poor animals that had to drag up there, the hill was about five miles long and a steady raise all the time without any breathing places.

The valley in which we were camped was covered with a luxurient growth of grass we camped in the shade of a mighty pair of monuments two immense columns of stone about the shape of a hens egg and about one hundred feet high and all that tremendous weight sustained and balanced on a slender neck about six feet in diameter. It appeared as if the slightest push would send it rolling from its rocky foundation, yet they have stood there and defied the storms for hundreds of years. The chief curiosity about them is I think in their being exactly similar you could not find the slightest difference. they stand about one hundred yards asunder they look like two mighty sentinals guarding the entrance to those gloomy regions. It is said that the Indians regarded them with fear and that before the coming of white men that they never entered the Rocky Mountains by this pass. viewed at the distance of a few miles they very much resemble the forms of men and I think it a matter of course that the poor ignorant Indian should view them with superstition and awe. We camped in this delightful valley for the night we were still at considerable of an elevation and the lights in the city of Denver twinkled far bellow us.

They had already organised a company of militia for its protection on the day after our a arrival they had invited the chiefs to a consultation in the town hall. six chiefs attended and the result of the conference was that the Indians agreed to go five miles down the river and encamp. the citizens agreed that if the Sioux were attacked by the Utes with whom they were then at war to send a company of militia to their assistance. The chiefs left apparently well satisfied we were also very glad to get rid of such dangerous neighbors for there was no denying the fact that they could have taken the city for there was not more than seven or eight hundred men opposed to their five hundred warriors.

One old Indian took us round and with pride showed is the bloody trophies of the fight gory looking scalps were stuck on long poles and each carried by a young boy while we were looking at the horrid specticle they gathered in a circle round the scalps and commenced a lamentation for the fallen b raves.

asked the old chap by signs what they intended doing with them he gave me a most diabolical grin looked savagely at the prissoners and said \"burn, burn, I did not think he was in earnest nor that they would dare attempt so barbarous an outrage so near a civilised city. The prissoners were a fine looking young brave seemingly as bold and defient as if he was free on his own mountain side again. the other was a young squaw about sixteen years of age she was very interesting looking and seemed to bear her imprissonment with the indifference and calm stoicism of her race. After showing us all over the incampment we gave our friendly old guide a few pieces of money and returned to our camp. It was now dark yet the everlasting \"tom, tom, and the accompanying howling was kept up as vigerously as ever and at short intervals we could hear a savage whoop given that would make your blood run cold. I felt the greatest sorrow for the poor young captives how they must tremble at heart although they show no outward signs of fear, as they hear those demons exciting their wild and ungovernable passions untill at last they get to such a pitch of fury that nothing but the blood of their  captive inemy can soothe them. After getting to our tents we had some supper and then lay downs to have some sleep. but we were disapointed in that the uproar made by the savages drove all thought of sleep out of our heads and they kept it up without ceasing for a  moment all the night. coming on the morning they howled yelled and shrieked like mad devils it was the most horrid din that I ever heard. Just at sunrise their fury reached a climax and they brought out the poor brave tied him to a stake made a great pile of brush round him and then setting it on fire burned the poor wretch to death.

place I saw a legal notice posted on a corner it was to the following effect, that the undersigned had built a bridge some two months since on Lariner st over Cherry Creek connecting the town of Auraria and Denver, that certain parties having failed to make the payments on said bridge as agreed upon, that after three days they forbid any one to cross said bridge at their peril that they should have a sufficient force there and shoot down any who would attempt to disobey this order of the court. Before we left the city I heard that they raised the money and paid for the bridge. This summary way of doing business works to a charm there is no resisting the court no such thing heard of as fining any one for contempt because no one would dare to show it he would be punished on the spot and in a most unpleasant manner. Since we arrived in the city there had been two executions and by making inquiries I found out that there is somebody hung every week. You must not think from this that was a hard place to live in I never saw a more quiet and law observing city I believe the severe and instantanous punishment of crime  ?  preventive, all the murders committed here spring from the gambling table the termination of a dispute was always left to the pistol or Bowie knife if one of the gamblers was killed the surviver was sure to have his neck stretched before two days and thus the community would be well rid of two ruffians. What was considered a crime deserving of death when committed by gamblers was passed off quietly as justifiable when done by other parties, if two men got into a dispute on the street they could settle it in any manner they thought proper and if one killed the other it was all done in fair fight and there was no hint of punishment but if it was a gambler he deserved no mercy and was hung up without any mercy.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64696,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64696","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/ec8dc2c77a7141988f93fb1b35687b58.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/ec8dc2c77a7141988f93fb1b35687b58.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/ec8dc2c77a7141988f93fb1b35687b58.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ec8dc2c77a7141988f93fb1b35687b58.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:08:11+00:00","modified":"2020-05-15T16:57:40+00:00","filename":"ec8dc2c77a7141988f93fb1b35687b58.jpg","authentication":"73f5d3acc7c4e9e2cfdc176d503f3c90","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00052_o2

our preparations being now completed on Friday the first day of July we determined to make a start for home. About noon we went to the \"Ranche\" to take out our animals our horses were easily found they were very poor and there was no danger of any one stealing them. A friend of ours who came with us did not have such good fortune he put a valuable team of mules into the Ranche now they could not be found the poor fellow grew frantic when he discovered his loss. The Ranche keeper could give no account of them but he supposed they were stolen during the night by the laws of the place he was responsible and could be made liable for the worth of any property left in his possession. But the owner of the mules would rather have them at that time than twice their nominal value at Denver. So he hired horses and scoured the country in all directions but it was a vain pursuit he never seen or heard aught of them. I am firmly convinced that the rascally \"Rancher\" connived at stealing them it was said that many valuable teams were taken from his place. Any how he got a judgement against the Ranche keeper for two hundred and fifty dollars. The Ranche was levied on and was to be sold in thirty days but the poor fellow could not remain there that long under expenses so he intrusted its collection to a lawyer of good standing in the city, and getting some friends to aid him he purchased another team and started for home. His lawyer was to send the price of his mules in a month but he never got a cent of it nor never received a bit of information from his lawyer there is no doubt but what the latter got the money and appropriated it to his own use. An honest man is a a rare thing to be found in any place but I think it is impossible to find one at all in a gold producing country, the very fact of  being where got easy brings around a lot of

On our journey hither we were full of high hope. we considered our fortunes was ready for us as soon as we should reach the mountains we had plenty of merry company all as sanguine as ourselves and with high health and rugged strength we enjoyed ourselves hugely and had nothing to ask for we traveled about five miles that afternoon and camped at night with the tribe of Sioux Indians that left Denver a few days before.

They were just as anxious to hear accounts of gold mining so we told them our experiences and what we considered their prospects in the country. I think the crusher is the only way that gold can ever be got in paying quantities from the rocky mountains. the quartz is rich in every part and if they can only get machinery that can pulverize it there is no doubt but that they can make money in that way. We chatted with them till very late of home and friends they left Chicago just seven weeks before that time and considering their heavy load they made first rate time. We all camped together that night father than some howling and yelling had no annoyance from the Indians just as soon as it gets dark they will not come near a white mans camp they know that we keep a watch and they are afraid of getting shot. At sunrise the next morning we parted from the train each one going in opposite direction. our road to day was through the finest land I had yet seen in this country the grass was nice and green and about four feet high I think it would be first rate lands to cultivate.

day we passed a beautiful island on the Platt River it was intirely different from any islands that I had yet seen the banks were bold and high and covered to the edge of the water with willow trees. There is a  bridge across the river here many of the immigrants cross it as it is the shortest route to Gregory there is a very fine house on the island but so covered in by thick foliage that you can not get a glimpse of it untill you are standing bedside it. It was built about fifteen years ago by a fur company for the purpose of a trading post with the Indians of the Rocky Mountains. We were now passing through a most delightful country the land rich, the grass luxurious, the blue river running clear and ripling by. it is the most charming place between the Missouri river and the Rocky Mountains. This day we met five crusher trains and great crowds of emmigrants pushing their way westward we would scan the faces eagerly while passing them to see if we could discover among them any one with whom we were acquanted. The Indians were very numerous in this vecinity we had left the Sioux country behind and were now among the Arrapahoes. they are a little superior to the Sioux in habits and appearance. it seems that wherever the white and the Indian live close together that the Indian will become filthy and depraved. It is accounted for by the white man selling him whisky. the Indian is passionately fond of it and would sell himself body and soul family and friends and children for to gratify his fiery appetite. The Indians used us very friendly seemed to be very eager to trade with us they brought out heaps of buck skins moccasins and buffalo roves we got some of the latter from them for about one pound of sugar for each hide. Money they would not take at all but sugar coffee and meat hams or bacon they could not resist exchanging for the most valuable commodity in their possession.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64700,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64700","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/5bf4d5ffcdb79131546339c1b56b4b52.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/5bf4d5ffcdb79131546339c1b56b4b52.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/5bf4d5ffcdb79131546339c1b56b4b52.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5bf4d5ffcdb79131546339c1b56b4b52.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:08:15+00:00","modified":"2020-05-04T16:17:14+00:00","filename":"5bf4d5ffcdb79131546339c1b56b4b52.jpg","authentication":"35126ac5d3ec23790239119ca22e7197","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00054_o2

Its mud walls were still standing about ten feet high six feet thick and an area of about a square achre it stood on slightly elevated ground and a first rate position for defense. We camped near its walls for the night, somehow although it was ruined and deserted we considered it far pleasanter to camp by its walls than to lay down on the open prairie. It was a fine moonlight night and as I sat there on the banks of the murmuring river listening to its monatonous rippling and seeing around me the vast prairie its undulating surface looking like the heaving sea, I could imagine that those ruined walls beside me were repaired I thought that crowds of martial men passed to and fro I imagined the sentry pacing to and fro on the wall and that I could hear his joyous ringing shoot of alls well.

The appearance of the country did not change much till we got to the Beaver Creek \"cut off,\" the road that we took on our journey out the grass now had a red schorched appearance and the horses did not much relish it after having such splendid grass the previous week. The road now presented an animated appearance crowds pushing on towards the mountains it looked like one continuous string uniting civilization with the wilderness We were greatly annoyed by their stopping us and making inquries it grew to be so great a neusance that we would not stop at all but answer all the questions we could while moving. we were compelled to do this or not make any progress on our journey. Our horses showed signs of giving out so we could not drive them more than from ten to fifteen miles a day, and sunday if we could find a good spot of grass we gave them all day to rest. In two weeks we came to O Fallons Bluffs the only spot on the whole route where the Bluffs extended to the river edge. they are some two or three hundred feet high standing perpindicular from the water it is very laborious work for teams to get over them. The distance is ten miles we crossed them in one day but it was an awful hard job we were now getting into the country where wood was scarce and got very uneasy thinking of how we could carry a supply along with us","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64702,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64702","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/6f4403f7141c88a00fbc82fc97f082a0.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/6f4403f7141c88a00fbc82fc97f082a0.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/6f4403f7141c88a00fbc82fc97f082a0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6f4403f7141c88a00fbc82fc97f082a0.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:08:16+00:00","modified":"2020-05-04T19:07:13+00:00","filename":"6f4403f7141c88a00fbc82fc97f082a0.jpg","authentication":"fbae039196845698bb80aade9ab757e5","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00055_o2 copy.jpg","size":1074856,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2843,"compression_ratio":0.070013157723323},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["105452+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["105452+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["105452+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6f4403f7141c88a00fbc82fc97f082a0.jpg","FileDateTime":1521817601,"FileSize":1074856,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2843\"","Height":2843,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2843,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:23 10:00:11","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":312},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":966,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4772},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:10:04 10:54:52","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:10:04 10:54:52","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":99,"SubSecTimeDigitized":99,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2843,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":995,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/995","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"From the weak condition of our horses we concluded it was impossible to carry any fuel and that we would trust to chance for a supply on the road.

Since we passed O Fallons Bluffs we have been traveling in the Cheyannes country, they are a fine warlike tribe of Indians the \"Camanchi\" of this part of the country they are above begging and other low lived employments of the most part of the tribes of the west. They are said to be great fighters have immense herds of ponies and almost live on horseback, in trading they are quick at making a bargain if they do not like your price they will not try to get more out of you but they will turn away instantly try a trade with some one else and have no more to do with you. It took us a week to get through their country and I really thought more of them than any I had yet seen on the plains. One evening about an hour before sunset we were camped only a short distance from a Cheyanne village, and a hunter drove up to our camp, he was riding a small pony and had the carcasses of two antelopes and a young deer also slung across his back. After saluting us in the usual friendly manner, \"how, how,\" we understood from him that he had been on the hunt all day and had nothing to eat, we gave him some tea and crackers which he eat with a relish, he then went to his pony and cut off the livers of the antelopes and gave them to us we considered it a great compliment for the Indians scarcely ever make a present of anything.

now suffered a great deal from heat and thirst the burning mid summer sun poured down on us all the long day with his fiercest beams water was very scarce and although our road lay mainly along the bank of the river sometimes the road would not come near the river for eight or ten miles. Every thing was parched and withered from the fierce heat of the sun the grass looked as if fire passed over it large fissures opened in the earth and night and day we suffered dreadfully from the intense heat. To add to our torments just as the sun went down the misquitoes assailled us furiously. they came around in myriads almost driving us mad by their incessent singing and their tantalizing sting. Of all the torments that ever was inflicted on poor humanity I think this is the most dreadful. there is not a moments relief no matter how tired you may be it is impossible to sleep you may lay down cover yourself all over with your blanket but you will not be safe. Some prying adventurous fellow will find a corner unprotected and will quickly intrude his proboseis and almost before you can roll out of your blanket he will have a measure of your blood. There I used to lay for hours fighting desperately with my small enimies with blankets rolled all around me and the prespiration streaming from every pore at last towards morning when the air grew cool we might get relief from our tormenters and snatch a few hours sleep. Oftentimes I thought they would kill some of us the torture was most horrible and not to be compared to anything I ever experienced how I would long for some quiet cool spot where free from any annoyance I could have a few hours undisturbed slumber. The worst infested of misquito swamps in the States is nothing in comparison to this place the critters are remorseless and stick to you with a perseverence and energy worthy of a better cause.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64706,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64706","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/00e085ee57dc590dc54bb36ab38d0f2f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/00e085ee57dc590dc54bb36ab38d0f2f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/00e085ee57dc590dc54bb36ab38d0f2f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/00e085ee57dc590dc54bb36ab38d0f2f.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:08:21+00:00","modified":"2020-05-08T20:26:34+00:00","filename":"00e085ee57dc590dc54bb36ab38d0f2f.jpg","authentication":"a7ce184736a58d6d154068493fa5b0c2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00058_o2.jpg","size":1773624,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3095,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053061209836654},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["105547+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["105547+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["105547+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"00e085ee57dc590dc54bb36ab38d0f2f.jpg","FileDateTime":1521817601,"FileSize":1773624,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3095\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3095,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Windows","DateTime":"2013:01:07 06:14:50","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":178},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:10:04 10:55:47","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:10:04 10:55:47","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":83,"SubSecTimeDigitized":83,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3267,"ExifImageLength":3800,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":995,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/995","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Our supply of wood was now run out and the scanty supply of buffalo chips that we picked up on the road was not sufficient to make fire enough to warm our water for tea or coffee and often times we had to eat half raw corn dodger.

Our mode of traveling left plenty of idle time on our hands at mid-day the sun poured down with intense heat so that it was as impossible for animals of any description to travel beneath its sweltering rays. We rose an hour before daybreak hitched up and immediately started. we traveled about four hours untill the sun grew pretty hot, when we looked for a shady place and camped then we had breakfast and then for six or seven long tedious hours we had to lay still in the shade I had Walter Scots works in pamphlet form and that was a first rate of opportunity for reading them I believe I should have died of the blues but for them. About three hours before sunset we started again on the road and traveled somtimes till an hour after dark or untill we found a desirable camping place. we made about fifteen miles a day just as much as our horses were able to accomplish. One night we camped after dark  in fixing the horses I stumbled several times over a little mound of earth. in the morning I was shocked to find out that we had been sleeping on a grave. we slept quiet and undisturbed during the night but if we knew of the lonly sleeper beneath us we would have left that place in a hurry.

As I saw those innumerable resting places of the California immigrants I shudderingly thought what if I should yet be laid down on this long dreary endless road to take my last long sleep to make one of those lowly mounds of earth of which we passed hundreds every day. I confess the thoughts were exceedingly unpleasant and I longed more than ever for to reach the borders of civilization. About seventy miles from Fort Karney we came to a new established trading post and purchased there some nescessaries we paid thirty cents a pound for flour forty cents for sugar and forty cents for bacon. The house was what is called a \"adobe\" house being made intirely of mud the roof having a few timbers on it and then sodded at a distance you would think it a small natural hill. The travelers we met told us that we would find plenty of buffalo in a few days the news raised us to the highest state of excitement we longed to encounter the huge unwieldy native of the prairies. The following night we were aroused by a bellowing noise we supposed it to be a herd of buffalos as the noise gradually died away. In the morning we eagerly scanned the prairie in every direction but could see no signs of buffalo we harnassed up our horses and traveled about eight miles. We heard a low rumbling noise like distant thunder then a great cloud of dust arose increasing every moment in extent and reaching up to the clouds we were in the highest state of excitement the cloud of dust suddenly cleared away and we saw an immense hered of buffalo only about a quarter of mile distant. It was a most grand and imposing sight from the slight elevation on which we were standing this great living mass could be seen stretching miles and miles away as far as the eye could reach was one compact solid body moving in one direction and making the earth shake beneath them.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64709,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64709","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/cfacd7f5e37e111f731218b37ffc0bb7.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/cfacd7f5e37e111f731218b37ffc0bb7.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/cfacd7f5e37e111f731218b37ffc0bb7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cfacd7f5e37e111f731218b37ffc0bb7.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:08:25+00:00","modified":"2020-05-08T20:21:23+00:00","filename":"cfacd7f5e37e111f731218b37ffc0bb7.jpg","authentication":"c9a42dc2e96882e701c14faef8ba325d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00061_o2.jpg","size":1372354,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2308,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.055056245587008},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["105718+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["105718+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["105718+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cfacd7f5e37e111f731218b37ffc0bb7.jpg","FileDateTime":1521817601,"FileSize":1372354,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2308\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2308,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Windows","DateTime":"2013:01:07 06:17:21","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":178},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:10:04 10:57:18","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:10:04 10:57:18","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":78,"SubSecTimeDigitized":78,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2441,"ExifImageLength":3807,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":995,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/995","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"They were traveling parallel with the road and soon we were within one hundred yards of the nearest we got out our rifles fired a volley and dropped two of them. one died instantly the other received five or six shots before he stretched himself out this was a glorious commencement of buffalo hunting and we felt highly elated at our success. We then proceeded to dress our game one was a young bull about four years old the other an old chap about sixteen the young one was about the size of a large ox five of us had all we could do to roll him over. we first cut off the hump considered by hunters as the choicest part then we skinned him the skin is valueless in this season and we trew it away then we cut him up into quarters in the same way they dress beeves at home. We kept some for cooking fresh and jerked the balance this is rather a curious process and worth describing we tear off the meat with the grain in thin slices then throw on some salt if you wish but it is not necessary for saving it then hang it in the sun or suspend it before a hot fire untill thoroughly dry it is then jerked meat and perfectly cured you may throw it in the bottom of your wagon or in any out of the way place and it will keep sweet and  good for a year or more Jerked buffalo meat salt I liked the flavor of very well but could not indure it in any other shape I tried it boiled and fried but could not bear the taste, even the hump what is called sweh a delicious morsel is as tough a sole leather and the liver as tough as ordinary  beef. The buffalo is only vulnerable in one small place under the fore shoulder if you drive a bullet in there he will drop on the instant but if you strike him in any other place it only irritates but cannot seriously hurt him.

We were now again on the borders of civilization there was a few farms on the banks of the streams, we eagerly purchased some vegatables butter eggs and bread we had none of these things for five months and you cannot imagine how good they tasted. We were a pretty hard looking set, sun burned as brown as Indians our hair and beard of five months growth and our cloths all torn into rags. our boots and shoes gave out more than a month since. Still we lived well we had an abundance of game, prairie chickens and quails they were so numerous that we could kill them with sticks, living so well we now took things quite leisuarly and was in no hurry together to the end of our journey. Plums and grapes grew in profusion in the forests the weather was beautiful and only for the great drouth we might have prolonged our journey a week more It was near seven weeks since we left Denver City and there had not been a drop of rain in that time farmers were greatly alarmed for their crops. their  ?  was dying in great numbers. We suffered great inconvenience from a scarcity of water we always had to carry a supply in a ten gallon keg and when that supply ran out we suffered very severely, only for that we would have probably have prolonged our journey another week. About fifty miles from St Joe we came into the bluffs of the Missouri River which was probably ten miles from us in a straight line, the whole country through which we now traveled was covered with enermos large cottonwood trees.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64717,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64717","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/aefa1fb0929c651610046c10d8aeb28a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/aefa1fb0929c651610046c10d8aeb28a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/aefa1fb0929c651610046c10d8aeb28a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/aefa1fb0929c651610046c10d8aeb28a.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:08:33+00:00","modified":"2020-05-08T15:04:33+00:00","filename":"aefa1fb0929c651610046c10d8aeb28a.jpg","authentication":"f916b2dadb97abd881e5310c9a43d551","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00068_o2.jpg","size":798945,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

arrived at the Missouri River without any other accident or adventure drove onboard the St Joe and Belmont ferry and soon landed on the levee of St Joseph. We felt very strange and odd suddenly transformed into a large city after wandering five months in the wilderness. Our returning journey from the mountains took just fifty two days including all delays from fatigue or other causes. Crowds of people gathered round us eagerly making inquiris about the land of gold we were some of the first returned pilgrims as they styled us we passed through the town to the lower end and then camped in the usual style some of our party felt big and wanted to go to a hotel they could not endure camp life another hour. There was still a few immegrants in St Joe about setting out for the west and there was ten crushers starting on the same day the whole number of crushers we met on the road was fifty three each one represented about ten thousand dollars. The first thing we done after hitching up was to go down town and into the a first class eating house we felt so very odd at first that we could hardly use a knife or fork it would be more natural to go with the victuals in the old style. We stopped in St Joe four days and then took the cors for Chicago arriving there two days after having made the whole trip to Pikes Peak and back in five months and two days.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}]

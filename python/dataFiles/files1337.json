Kept my trail as long as possible on return (not that it was the best or nearest route, tho it subsequently turned out to be best) but because the mules travelled easier & better over the broken road.  the snow is yet very deep in places.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":112431,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/112431","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/231daf6fae860ee0871c6f41973bb319.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/231daf6fae860ee0871c6f41973bb319.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/231daf6fae860ee0871c6f41973bb319.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/231daf6fae860ee0871c6f41973bb319.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-15T17:13:16+00:00","modified":"2021-01-02T16:19:17+00:00","filename":"231daf6fae860ee0871c6f41973bb319.jpg","authentication":"c5576c774787fa5b3a1b3cb48d9d1b3b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"GR_1110-7_0022_o2.jpg","size":1279983,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2385,"resolution_y":3021,"compression_ratio":0.059216650462833},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"By-line":["K"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"By-line":["K"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0002"],"By-line":["K"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1337,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1337","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"13.\nInstead of following our tortuous route back across Terrapin, I stuck to the divide.

The Black Jack Timber [unclear] just on the divide.  Avoiding the passage of any ravine however slight.  We came by a very crooked route - but in a generally very direct course to the very head of the ravines.  Then struck due south. We had some cutting to do in the timber, but got through very nicely. Once on the open I struck direct for Naked Bend where I camped.  Distance 25 miles. Made a sketch at night, which I showed to Chapman who pronounced it as good as if I has compass & chain.

Indians, I have the honor to mail herewith a number of sheets giving outlines of body and arms and of typical positions of hand and fingers, which can be used as bases for alteration and reference and will be furnished in larger supplies if desired.  A sheet of examples of the proposed mode of using those forms is also enclosed, and a revised List of Signs prepared to suggest inquiry or refresh memory.  It is desirable that both the figured illustrations and a clear written description shall be employed, each tending to supplement and explain the other, and when striking facial changes or emotional postures seem to individualize or accentuate the gesture, notice of them in the written description would be important.  The sheets can also be used for successive signs forming a speech or story, being cut and pasted in the proper order to show native syntax.\n    In continued hope that this Bureau will have the benefit of your assistance and that its publication may be mailed to you enriched by your contribution,   \n\nI Remain \nVery Respectfully Yours,\n\nGarrick Mallery\n\nBvt.

I am sorry they cannot reach you by \nthe time you wish, but the delay has not been with me.\n\n I am sorry you cannot see your way clear to waive your interest in the copyright of the book.\n\nI am not given to pessimism - at least I didn't know I was - & I have not painted the prospects of future sales\nin an unfavorable light to induce you to accede to the request I made.  I merely stated the facts just as they\nwere.  The book has been out one year, & I have devoted my very best efforts, all my time, & spent no end of\nmoney, to make a good sale.  The result is that something less than 20.000 copies have been sold.  This has not\npaid me by any means.  The book was a very expensive one to bring out.  I put altogether too much money into\nthe Enterprise, and fixed the price of the Vol too low.  The book has certainly had Everything in its favor, but the \nbig sale has not been made.  I do not know what\nmore I can now do to increase the sale.  Practically the sale is over - the cream was clean gone some\nmonths ago.

It appears however that she has immediate & most pressing need of $1000, & on Oct 14 she sent me for signature a deed & mortgage (which I enclose you) asking me to sign - for her benefit.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":112507,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/112507","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/db932680631f946219327eb80f601e72.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/db932680631f946219327eb80f601e72.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/db932680631f946219327eb80f601e72.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/db932680631f946219327eb80f601e72.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-15T17:14:31+00:00","modified":"2021-01-05T04:27:23+00:00","filename":"db932680631f946219327eb80f601e72.jpg","authentication":"10bd78a2bd74ce624f494337c0301ac3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"GR_1110-7_0103_o2.jpg","size":929395,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1659,"resolution_y":2488,"compression_ratio":0.075055464138251},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"By-line":["K"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"By-line":["K"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0002"],"By-line":["K"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1337,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1337","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"This I then declined to do as I had no certainty as to how the estate stands - On yr statement that you have $3000 in mortgages I have concluded to sign these papers & send them to you for use or not as the condition of the estate shall warrant.

The sale has dropped off greatly in the past three months; indeed, for the past month I have scarcely sold 154 copies.  Practically the sale of the book is now over, and it is not likely that the returns next July will exceed 500 copies, as things look now.  I find I have sold or disposed of nearly 37,000 copies of this book. I think you ought to be pleased with the result. Mighty few books ever reach those figures. I have pushed it and done my level best with it.\nI inclose circular of \"Our Famous Women\", my new book - a decided contrast to \"Our Wild Indians\", in subject. I brought it out last fall, and it is now selling fairly well, though business of all kinds is completely stagnant. \n\n   When you kill a real good big buffalo please have him carefully skinned and send me the robe for my sleigh.

In asking you to send me a robe I did not mean to be understood as asking you to give it to me, much less of robbing you of a skin you had procured for your own use, and which I am sure you prized.  I was willing and expected to pay for it.  I thought that by sending to you I should be sure of getting a real good one; and, of course, like the majority of Eastern people, I supposed choice robes might be very easily obtained almost anywhere among the Indians.\n\n  I have shown the robe to several of my friends, all of whom pronounce it a most excellent one, and they are without exception surprised at the softness of the skin.  I am delighted with it myself, and shall always prize it for its giver and for the pleasant associations it will always recall.\n   I will have a copy of the book bound in the best manner I can possibly get it done in at our bindery here.

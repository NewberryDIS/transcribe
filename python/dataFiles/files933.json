He has expressed the wish to make the acquaintance of your family, and so fresh in my memory is your kindness to me while a sojourner in your beautiful city that it is a privilege I should wish every friend of mine to enjoy.  Enroute here I fell in with Genl Terry, and had the pleasure of his company on the Boat from St. Joseph to Omaha.  I cannot begin to tell you how much I was pleased with him, a more elegant gentleman I have never met.

People's ideas differ so on matters of clothing for infants that it is somewhat difficult to decide certain points. The one that I am considering just now is whether or not to make any white nainsook or muslin petticoats. An article in the Tribune says a baby should have 6 of them and 4 flannel ones. An article in Physical Culture says one ought to provide plenty of flannel petticoats but that the other kind is quite unnecessary.

It seems to be a flourishing business, and he would have an excellent opportunity to establish a good private practice in connection with it. This appears to me to be a wise move, considering the fact that the Blair Remedy Co. is not doing well and probably will go to pieces in another year. Since those are his plans, Max and I have talked the matter over with him and about decided to take a small flat on the south side for a year or so, anyway. Max will continue with the Krueger, of course, and has really fine prospects of making a big thing of his printing business. We would all like better than anything to take the house in Glen Ellyn, but when Doc gets the drugstore on his hands he will have to live right on the premises, for a time, at least, and the G.

She asked about you, Grandma, and sent her love. I arranged to meet Max at the station in time for the 10:20 train, but found when I got there that the guests were conspicuous by their absence and most of them arrived at about 9:00 when they had planned to come at 7:30. I told Ruth that I was planning to take the 10:20 but she said I couldn't get it and that seemed to dispose of the matter, in her mind at least. So, aside from worrying about Max, I spent a very delightful evening.

The napkins were \"storkish\", too. The favors were little stork images with boxes of little colored candies under them. Lettuce sandwiches, fruit salad with whipped cream, nuts, ice cream, cake, and coffee, were served. The cake was white frosted, with little candy corns on top forming the letters Greek letters Tau, Delta, Phi.\nAs soon as the supper was over with we adjourned to the parlor and the \"shower\" commenced. I sat in a chair at the table and opened the gifts, one by one, while the girls looked on. And Oh! they are all splendiferous! I'm so anxious for you to see them. There is a wonderful carriage robe, presented by Ella, and made by her. It is white, with beautiful embroidery, and a large bow of blue ribbon surmounts it. Then Norine gave me a nice soft blue and white blanket with rabbits outlined on it. Ethel presented a lovely pillow case, embroidered, made by herself. Elsie gave a dear little cap embroidered in blue silk, also hand made. Ruth Doescher and Ruth Nelson (the new member) each gave a lovely little sacque trimmed with blue ribbon and embroidered in blue silk. Mary gave me a pair of blue ribbon elastic bands with rosettes to keep up the baby's sleeves.

They were very nice and I got a little over two quarts. It takes a good many apples to make just a little jelly, I find. I was obliged to use two kettles besides the dish pan to cook them in and they got burned a little, which didn't impart a very good flavor to the jelly.

Printing, education, pioneer life, and religion are all discussed within the letters. Included are the papers of Robert Everett, the pastor of Welsh Congregationalist churches in Oneida County, New York, and publisher of Y Cenhadwr Americanaidd (The American Missionary), a Welsh religious reform magazine that was pro-abolition. Also included are letters and materials of Mary Everett, a graduate of New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, who was also involved in the suffrage movement, John Roberts and Sarah Colgrove Everett, pioneers who moved to Kansas Territory in 1854 and were active in abolitionist activities, and Cynthia Everett, a member of the American Missionary Association who taught freedmen in Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina, following the Civil War. <a href=\"https:\/\/mms.newberry.org\/xml\/xml_files\/Everett.xml#sum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide\u00a0<\/a><br \/><br \/> Elizabeth Everett Butler (1818-1877) was the eldest daughter of Robert &amp; Elizabeth Everett. Educated at the Young Ladies' Domestic Seminary in Clinton, NY, she remained there as a teacher and also principal. She married Reverend J.J. Butler and had a son, John H., and two daughters, Elizabeth (Lizzie) and Hattie. The family lived in New Hampton, New Hampshire, for many years, later settling in Hillsdale, Michigan, where Butler was a professor of theology at Hillsdale College. Their son J.H. Butler was professor of Latin there as well. To improve his poor health, J.J. Butler traveled to Europe in 1867, and his letters home include his observations of Italy and the religious climate there. Hattie married a preacher, Holden Putnam, and settled in Ludington, Michigan where Putnam was pastor of the Congregational Church.","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":41,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/41","name":"Description","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Elizabeth Everett Butler and J.J.

unclear with the Father. Permit me just briefly to review a few of the points you referred? to in your letter. I perfectly agree with you in believing that Christ is the Son of God. Still that does not prevent his being equal to God. Nay unclear fact that he is the Son would go to show that he was equal. As Christ himself says that men may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. You I presume will admit that there is in a sense an equality subsisting between Father & Son. --\nOf course I do not suppose that Paul intends to teach that himself & Apollos are one person, neither does Christ when he says \"I & my Father are one\" mean to say that he & his Father are identically the same person, but he does teach it seems to me unclear as language can teach that while he & his Father are distinct persons they are equal, equal in power & glory. So to unclear reference for Christ's followers being one, he prays that they may be united in that intimate bond of fellowship. One in feeling. In perfect equality as himself and his father are one. In reference to the trinity I will say but little. I consider in one of the most glorious truths in the whole Bible I do not see how many pages in the Bible can be explained without it. It seems as though we had some indication of it in Genesis when God says let us make man. unclear & may appear to you to be nothing more than a unclear, unclear In Christ's baptism do we not have three divine manifestations the voice from Heaven? the Father, Jesus the Son & the dove the Holy Ghost & then what means this solemn language baptising them in the name of the Father * Son & H.G. three persons in the Godhead equal in power & glory. I believe that Christ was while on earth both God & man, that there was in him unclear union of the human & divine & it is something that is not at all unclear the union of sould & body in man. He was the God-man. The unclear, unclear just what I mean. That Christ was unclear, unclear near no proof of count, couse? That he was God I think you ought to admit if I can show that he had the following attributes - eternal existence unclear omniscience, omnipotence & omnipresence. If Christ had these qualities must he not be divine. unclear his eternity. Before Abraham was I am. With his glory unclear with thee before the world was & c. 2nd immutability. Jesus is the same yesterday today & forever. Heb 13? & 3rd unclear for he knew what was in man Jov 2 2b? Lord thou knowest all things than knowest that I love thee Jov 21 17.4? omnipotence.

When two or three are gathered together than am I in the midst. Mat 18, 20, the unclear of thim that believeth unclear, unclear, unclear Eph 1.2 unclear I might add on other passages but must we not from this admit that Christ is divine.

They have heard nothing from Mr. Eatan, direct, of late; but are under the impression that he is doing well for the Institution. There is nothing in the power of the Trustees and friends of the Institute that they are not willing to do for its success.

July 7, 1852,\nDear Sir - \nSome time since your brother agreed to mention my name to you as an assistant in the Institute. If you intend to do without, I have nothing more to say. If an assistant is necessary, please consider me for a moment with a few negative underlined advantages.  I am not a young man. I am by no means an inexperienced teacher. Among the students who know me, I believe there is no one who would give satisfaction so general as should I, except perhaps brother Elisha. For a bare pittance paid regularly underlined I would be willing to relieve you of many onerous burdens. Be kind enough to write me. \nThere is much disappointment, and regret that you are not to be here at commencement.

Next to your safe arrival we want to hear how you are situated as regards board and cold water.  We have no fears for you in any thing else, only get the right kind of food with regular bathing, your school will prosper, one other thing I would not have you neglect - plenty of sleep is highly important, we have just read a piece in the Water Cure Journal on nervous diseases, and thought you would come under that head.

The new liquor law works well throughout the State. Dr. Taylor has been very angry with Lewis Sanderson for saying what every body else says that he loves brandy to well. The Doct. has threatened to sue for defamation. I had thought of speaking to you about it in my last but supposed nothing more would be done - I would let it rest. It seems to have broken out anew, and a suit seems more certain. Lewis is Chairman of the Temperance Committee and quite decided in having the law enforced. The same day we called on Mr. Brown the Taverner, I saw him at Mr. Andrews shop when Brown said Doct. Taylor sends patients to me for spirituous liquor, L. told him not to mind Doct. T. for he liked Brandy himself and it was reported that he sometimes had to take a nap before administering medicine, a few such like things he spoke as report. Brown spoke of it to Wetherell who set the Doct. all on fire, he has raved and tore been to Fitchburg twice to see lawyer Wood, what it will all amount to time alone will develop. Brown was excited because he could not sell rum Wetherell no less so and has been urging Taylor on. There are various reports of damages the higher $10,000 the lower $1,000.

I wrote to Dr. Regimir when I was on my way past that I was almost entirely discouraged and asked for for directions from the directors, but received none, and on my arrival home found none but I had received a promise from Mr. Waggoner of Tiffin, Seneca Co. that if I would make a visit the he would use his influence in raising funds for the school, and with high anticipations I started a journey of 150 miles expressly to see what I could do. But you can imagine my disappointment when I arrived and found him all carried away with \"Spiritual Manifestations\" and so completely soured with Gurley and others who had written against it, was he, that I could not get a dollar from him nor anyone else in all that region. He is immensely rich and so are others whom he mentioned, but they all turned immortal Rappers and the sprits have told them, as they allege, that they must keep all their funds to build a Spiritual Temple, and brother Geo.

Ohio\nJan. 21st , 1853\nDear Sir:\n\n                         Having ascertained that there was a School of the Universalist faith conducted by efficient men at Marietta, I thought I would write to ascertain whether the Hebrew language was taught, and the Theology of the faith given to young men wishing to become proclaimers of the truth. I am not very well acquainted with the history of  Universalism, but it seem to me there ought to be more Schools to prepare young men for the ministry- to prepare them aright- giving them a thorough Classical and Theological education, thus enabling them to meet and effectually refute Partialism whenver they Come in contact.

The Universalists more especially have need of education in order that they may wholly eradicate every vestige of the traditionary teachings of Partialism, and inculcate into them the glorious truths of the Bible.

I waited some time, hoping I could get a favorable answer in reference to the boarding of my daughter when you Boarded, but receiving no intelligence I wrote to Mrs. Mixer to See if She would take her. (I had heard that Mrs. Boothe was full of Boarders) and felt verry sorry that She could not accommodate us.  I thought if any body was Entitled to any favor of that kind We certainly were.  It is not my nature to complain, but really it cast a more dense Cloud over my Spirits that had already Seemed low down, because of misfortune through which I had passed and hundreds of disappts.  I had met with while trying to keep up the Institute and promoted its best interests. But let that pass.\nIn answer to your inquiry about the propriety of Being Ordained before you receive letters of fellowship. I consider it would be perfectly proper to do so if there is nothing Expressly to prohibit it in the constitution of the Washington Association. And I do not know as there is. Or if you wished to go out under Unitarian colors it might be proper even if there was a prohibition in that Association. (I suppose that is the Job!!) I do not know certainly as I will be there, because if you are ordained and Mr. W. from Wheeling can be present - there will be Enough to form a Quorum and transact the duties of the occasion. And if you are ordained (if you are careful to get your License)  you can do the interesting Job.

For I intend preaching three times: or if the people think best, I will deliver my Daniel Webster sermon in the body of A day. I have such a sermon. This prepared with much care & toil. I preached it to my own people. It is published in pamphlet & I should have sent my Marietta friends some complimentary copies, had it not been that I meditated an exchange with Bro Bartlett & was just about writing him when I rec'd your first note. I have prepared it with reference to some calumnies upon which I was questioned by your people when B. was with them in the summer. He has many warm? admirers in your town as he has indeed every where, & I thought I could repreach it there bringing down some copies of the primitive? pamphlet & exposing them to sale & have notice given thereof in your papers & in such other ways as us usual with you. I will preach it as one of the regular services or on Sabbath evening, or on any other evening of mystery as you or Brother Bartlett shall deem best. but preach it sometime in Marietta I must because it in part belongs to them; o.e. rec'd from some of its Citizens a part of the impulse with which it was undertaken.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43080,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/43080","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/8ee8c8d636e4bf37f91bb45c40f2dc7e.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/8ee8c8d636e4bf37f91bb45c40f2dc7e.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/8ee8c8d636e4bf37f91bb45c40f2dc7e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8ee8c8d636e4bf37f91bb45c40f2dc7e.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T16:15:57+00:00","modified":"2020-04-26T03:47:56+00:00","filename":"8ee8c8d636e4bf37f91bb45c40f2dc7e.jpg","authentication":"13c65dfc5228e5f0815df7b1e837e100","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_095_011_002_o2.jpg","size":1278164,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2855,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041453071284945},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["051122"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["051122"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["051122"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8ee8c8d636e4bf37f91bb45c40f2dc7e.jpg","FileDateTime":1509466156,"FileSize":1278164,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2855\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2855,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:09 13:54:24","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 05:11:22","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 05:11:22","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":86,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2996,"ExifImageLength":3777,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":187,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/187","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I send you enclosed the notice which I wish read from the desk on the Sabbath before from any other asks that will read notices of what occurs in your church, & also inserted in your papers at a suitable day or days previous.

Dr. Cutter writes me that he expects to be present & it will be a fine opportunity for you to see him.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43116,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/43116","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/bc7c92ea8ddb415ddba5d979b798ef1c.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/bc7c92ea8ddb415ddba5d979b798ef1c.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/bc7c92ea8ddb415ddba5d979b798ef1c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/bc7c92ea8ddb415ddba5d979b798ef1c.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T16:17:43+00:00","modified":"2020-04-22T03:15:48+00:00","filename":"bc7c92ea8ddb415ddba5d979b798ef1c.jpg","authentication":"bfc528aa7631bc2dd2f5ecce8248b769","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_096_005_005_o2.jpg","size":1578591,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2754,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05307401355604},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["051543"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["051543"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["051543"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"bc7c92ea8ddb415ddba5d979b798ef1c.jpg","FileDateTime":1509466158,"FileSize":1578591,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2754\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2754,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:09 13:55:51","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 05:15:43","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 05:15:43","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":83,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2793,"ExifImageLength":3650,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":187,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/187","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I expect to be there myself & I shall be pleased to see you.

I have come to this conclusion, that duty to my family demands that I place my children in a situation where they can avail themselves of the advantages of a good School. I think this object would be served by a residence on your town. Several of the brethren with whom I have conversed have also expressed the opinion, that I could render myself highly useful in that field of labor.\n Under these circumstances, I am induced to say, if my services are desired, I will go to Marietta on the conditions mentioned, VIZ seven hundred dollars salary.

My first select school, was the pleasantest school I have ever taught. Perhaps one great reason for this was, that I found myself much relieved by a division of labor. After the close of my winter school, I found myself more inclined than ever, to make teaching a profession; and, in order to fit myself, the more ably to perform the duties of this office, I decided to pursue my studies during the summer at the N.E. Normal Institute. This school is one which was established last spring, in the beautiful town of Lancaster, under the direction of Professor Mr. Russell, and the patronage of the town. Differing from other normal schools of the commonwealth, it has no assistance from the state. It has for its chief object the fitting of teachers for High and Grammar schools, although none are restricted to a particular course of study. It is arranged as a school of departments each under the care of a separate principal instructor and assistants Proff. Russell, Principal of the Rhetorical and Elocutionary departments, Dana P. Colburn, Prin. of Math. Department; William I. Whitaker, Prin.

All well on board, and fair prospects for a general time of health, previous to our arrival the City was visited with 3 or 4 days of quite cool weather, which checked the fever very much, it is now quite warm again, but the health of the City is still improving. Our present trip down is the best we have made this season, after writing you from Cairo, we took more stock on board which together with our great number of Deck Passengers made us out a good trip for the times. The \"Goddess\" is advertised for St. Louis which place we will depart for within 2 or 3 days.

The letter instead of being left at Cairo as directed, was taken on to Memphis, I presume by the boat it was put on at Cinti, and no doubt was there as I passed down. I accidentally found it at last, on landing at Memphis yesterday, I enquired if they had seen any letter to my address, and was informed by the keeper of the wharf Boat that he had not, but being not altogether satisfied I commenced looking over the files of old letters which were sticking up in the Office and behold in the last file which was my last hope at that point, I found a letter from my dear Wife, which I do assure you was thankfully recd.

As we have several ministers on board, I expect to be favored with a sermon tomorrow. --","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":50491,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/50491","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/85240734a5f7681819bd024b7a23949e.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/85240734a5f7681819bd024b7a23949e.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/85240734a5f7681819bd024b7a23949e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/85240734a5f7681819bd024b7a23949e.jpg"},"added":"2017-12-08T17:42:20+00:00","modified":"2020-05-08T16:14:48+00:00","filename":"85240734a5f7681819bd024b7a23949e.jpg","authentication":"a79c53f7dd9d0d0262a761773d543bc5","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_pearce_box_01_fl_016_003_02_o2.jpg","size":1606944,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2778,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053560515158787},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20161024"],"TimeCreated":["223923+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20161024"],"TimeCreated":["223923+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20161024"],"TimeCreated":["223923+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"85240734a5f7681819bd024b7a23949e.jpg","FileDateTime":1512754299,"FileSize":1606944,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2778\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2778,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:10:26 11:36:50","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:10:24 22:39:23","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:10:24 22:39:23","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTime":0,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"SubSecTimeDigitized":0,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3202,"ExifImageLength":4148,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":226,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/226","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The \"Champion\" left Cairo a few days before we passed down, she was destined for St. Louis, and will find water sufficient to let her up and out again. --\nMy health remains good, and I fondly hope this may find you, and all the family participating an equal blessing. --\nI desire that you, and all the family may be prepared to take a trip South when you think most convenient and expedient.

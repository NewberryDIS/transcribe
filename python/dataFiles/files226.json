Although I am almost constantly thinking of you, and our little daughter and the balance of the family, and would give almost anything to see you, yet I feel satisfied and thankful when I here that you are in the enjoyment of health, and blessed with the necessaries of life, during this inclement season, whilst in the course of my travels, I see so many perishing both for the want of food, and raiment. \nI will probably send you some papers, if I have time to get them, and will write you again from Cairo or some other convenient point. My self & Charley are in good health, and fondly hope this may soon reach you & find you all enjoying an equal blessing, I hope to receive a letter from you, on my return to Cairo, you will please write on recpt of this and direct to that point.\nMy best love to you & our little darling & all the family, \nFrom you Sincere and Affectionate Husband,\nC.

All well on board, and fair prospects for a general time of health, previous to our arrival the City was visited with 3 or 4 days of quite cool weather, which checked the fever very much, it is now quite warm again, but the health of the City is still improving. Our present trip down is the best we have made this season, after writing you from Cairo, we took more stock on board which together with our great number of Deck Passengers made us out a good trip for the times. The \"Goddess\" is advertised for St. Louis which place we will depart for within 2 or 3 days. I think we will be able to get a load, or the balance of what we want as there was money enough sent by us, to purchase about 100 tons T. I. Salt. I am anxious to return with dispatch, in order to get another good passenger trip down from St. Louis, they will leave there with a rush, after learning the improvement of the health of this City.

The letter instead of being left at Cairo as directed, was taken on to Memphis, I presume by the boat it was put on at Cinti, and no doubt was there as I passed down. I accidentally found it at last, on landing at Memphis yesterday, I enquired if they had seen any letter to my address, and was informed by the keeper of the wharf Boat that he had not, but being not altogether satisfied I commenced looking over the files of old letters which were sticking up in the Office and behold in the last file which was my last hope at that point, I found a letter from my dear Wife, which I do assure you was thankfully recd. I am happy to learn by it that your health had improved, and that Ann Maria was some better, and the balance of the family enjoying a usual degree of health. I am anxious to hear from you on my arrival at St. Louis, and hope to hear that our darling babe has fully recovered.\nI can with great pleasure inform you that we are all well on board, and have been during the trip.

Cincinnati Feb 21st 1846\nMy Dear Wife,\nWe are at this time nearing Vicksburg, on our downward passage, and feel some better than when I last addressed you, as regads my trip, in consequence of getting upwards of 100 head of cattle at Helena, (Ark.) which will bring our receipts up to our last trip, say $3,000.\nWe expect to reach N. Orleans on Monday evening, and depart from thence in time to arrive at Louisville about 2 or 3d proximo, as previously advised. --\nMy health remains good, and truly hope this may find you all participating in the same inestimable blessing. -- I have written you twice before this, since I left you, one of which was left at Cairo, and the other at Memphis, this I will leave at Vicksburg, all of which I hope will reach you by due course of mail, or otherwise.\nRemember me to all the family, and please accept my best love for yourself, our little darlings with lots of kisses. --\nYour Sincere & Affectionate Husband\nC.

I had a very pleasant passage around, only it seemed to me that I was leaving home, which attachment I have never so fully experienced for Cincinnati before. I find my friends all well here and they highly congratulate my return, and proceedings during my absence in Cincinnati.

of doing better, and let the present crowd get out of the way. We have been talking about forming a regular line between St Louis and Cincinnati to leave every other day. but nothing finally concluded.  This arrangement would take five boats and each to make a trip every 10 days, we shall still leave this place under consideration.  I was calculating to write you from Louisville, but as we left that city at about 9 o'clk in the morning I had not time to do so, I send this by the \"West Wind\" which is now ringing her bell to depart, so I must be in haste and come to a close.

Oct. 30th 1842  My Dear Wife, After leaving Cincinnati I did not arrive here until Thursday evening, being detained on the way by fog, and getting aground, On my arrival at the Boat the water was within 2 or 3 inches of being enough to put us afloat, I watched it very anxiously for a day or two, and discovered it was falling again.  But we soon heard that the rise from above was winding its way down, which finally reached us to day, and set us afloat.  We are  now laying at anchor in the Middle of the river, waiting for the water to come down, I have not decided whether we will go to St. Louis or New Orleans, but at all events shall endeavor to get out of the Ohio should the water rise enough here to justify us in starting out. Charley arrived here the next day after I did, I should like to come to ?, but think it doubtful, as I am very anxious to get out of the river, and have to watch the movements of the waters. My love to you and or little daughter, all the family  From your Affectionate Husband C.

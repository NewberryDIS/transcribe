March 20th 1933\nDarling Lafern:\n\n  We have had a gale all day and the wind is still blowing. I went out several times and picked up the King oranges that have blown off - got nearly a bushel, many weighing close to a pound. Wish you had them. I eat all I can, but there are many to give away.  They crack as they fall, then the ants and flies get into them in a short time and they are ruined. There is no sale for them. Those on the trees might as well be taken off - Do you want some?      My ankle is very sore this evening as I've pottered around such a lot today. Had a letter from Mrs Griffeth written from Glendale - a suburb of Los Angeles - four days after the quake. She was unhurt, but badly frightened. Friends of hers in Long Beach wrapped themselves in blankets and staid in autos on the mountainsides and haven't yet had their clothes off! These people couldn't go back to their apts until they had been inspected and pronounced safe, as the walls were cracked. I think I prefer to risk the hurricanes to the earthquakes! \n So glad to get your letter yesterday. Thanks for the stamps. I laughed and laughed over the camel being urged uppty-up with the cheerful executioner waiting for him up at the top.

I have just finished reading Andr\u00e9 Siegfried's America Comes of Age, and it is one of the most enlightening books I've ever read.  He starts in with the pioneering period, traces the streams of migration across the continent, the settlements of the different nationalities with their religious views, and shows how today the different parts of the U.S. still keep the religious and political as well as moral views that they have inherited from their old puritanical, Calvinistic forbears.   In the first part - the Ethnic [?Situati\u00f3ne?]  he tries to answer his own question Will America remain Protestant and Anglo Saxon, by discussing the melting pot, the religious aspect, puritan resistance to freedom of thought, the color problem, prohibition, race consciousness and eugenics, Ku Klux Klan, etc. Then he takes up the economic situation; the political situation and analyses the different parties, international relations, our antagonism to the yellow races, and our viewpoint as contrasted with that of Europe. I feel as tho I had spent some time in college, I've learned so much. I'd like now to read his analysis of the Depression, the failure of the financial system, etc if he ever writes one.

There is going to be a big movement to have that done, and people won't be satisfied until it is done for everybody has lost confidence in the old banking system.\n   It has begun to rain, and I'm glad that I'm going to celebrate by going to bed. \n\nStacks of love, \nMother.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118251,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118251","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/0cfd187a982714b1b21b7e88ea1a0b04.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/0cfd187a982714b1b21b7e88ea1a0b04.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/0cfd187a982714b1b21b7e88ea1a0b04.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0cfd187a982714b1b21b7e88ea1a0b04.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:25:33+00:00","modified":"2021-03-13T01:03:00+00:00","filename":"0cfd187a982714b1b21b7e88ea1a0b04.jpg","authentication":"677e420253ca6ecb6f8106eafe89846e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_134_002_001_o2.jpg","size":748731,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3600,"resolution_y":1667,"compression_ratio":0.0415878490968473},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["225151-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["225151-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["225151-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0cfd187a982714b1b21b7e88ea1a0b04.jpg","FileDateTime":1612459518,"FileSize":748731,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3600\" height=\"1667\"","Height":1667,"Width":3600,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:24:38","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.011111111111111112,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 22:51:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 22:51:51","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.491853,"ApertureValue":4.33985,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":4233,"ExifImageLength":1961,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1382,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1382","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"My mother May Walden wrote the enclosed parts of a letter when in Avon Park, Fla, apparently in 1935, to a former schoolmate whose name I do not recall.

I think Woodford didn't join in, as we had good grounds and buildings for many years. The clock has struck eight. The paper has just come. I wanted to begin a chapter on my early political opinions, but it must wait. \nJan.19.  So you attended a Townsend club meeting? I went to their district meeting Thursday afternoon out of curiosity, and took notes for Dr. Brewster.   He couldn't go. They say they have no intention of advocating a third party. They have the same tactic that Upton Sinclair employs - use old party candidates but get them to endorse their platform. Such things never work. An old time politician has too many Capitalist ideas firmly embedded in his brain cells to be able to keep his promises, even if he knows how to use his vote. I encourage the idea of pensions, not only for old people, but for everybody. I [unclear] the mere fact of getting together on an economic idea is a step ahead for many people, so I favor it, but I have not joined the club. \n\n  You have done much more writing for the public than I. I have written letters and diaries voluminously, but very little otherwise, and some of it is out of print.

I have a very dear friend who lives now, and has for years in Normal. Had a letter this past week from her. She taught me music for several years. Yes, I recall the Overland Monthly and the Woman's Magazine and the Daily. I was in St. L. at the time of the Fair there and took my little daughter. We went to the development and heard the publisher - wasn't his name Lewis? - give an address. He was a clever schemer, but little more, and was on the decline at the time. Your thrill over the Lahore, India paper reminds me of one I had - an article which was syndicated in a Chicago paper was translated into Spanish for an educational monthly there, then re-translated into English and printed in some school paper here in the U.S. My father-in-law Prof. Alexander Kerr, who was professor emeritus at Wisconsin U. after teaching Greek there 39 years, found the article and gave me the copy. It has been lost in all these years of moving about, but the subject of the paper was teaching children by suggestion, and founded upon the experiences and successes I had with my own Katherine.

I sent Marvin a card, and he replied promptly with one that is very pretty, a trail through the pines.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118277,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118277","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/20ccc17b28ac02321eb9f6d555b08de5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/20ccc17b28ac02321eb9f6d555b08de5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/20ccc17b28ac02321eb9f6d555b08de5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/20ccc17b28ac02321eb9f6d555b08de5.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:26:03+00:00","modified":"2021-02-12T21:49:27+00:00","filename":"20ccc17b28ac02321eb9f6d555b08de5.jpg","authentication":"696d6925a0a4c8b85b345fc47d1b94df","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_134_008_006_o2.jpg","size":1625051,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3198,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0470505582192574},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["230247-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["230247-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["230247-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"20ccc17b28ac02321eb9f6d555b08de5.jpg","FileDateTime":1612459519,"FileSize":1625051,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3198\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3198,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:25:43","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.011111111111111112,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 23:02:47","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 23:02:47","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.491853,"ApertureValue":4.33985,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2771,"ExifImageLength":3119,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1382,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1382","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"6\/So glad he can have this outing.

I spend Sund. aft and all day Monday out there getting her ready. Poor Byrum has had an awful time doing his part. He bought the pink slip, shirt and panties she wore, and the clerk gave him a 38 slip when she should have had a 32. I had to hem it up and take up seams. Then he forgot to wash out here stockings until rather late, and after they were dried I mended a hole in the foot. I ironed two hours, and I guess she did as much, using a gasoline iron that I expected \nThought you might like the scarf to wear at a dance, or use it as an adornment in some play. Mrs. McCord, Mrs. Harry Woodruff's sister, gave it to me.

Hope the weather was good so you could get pictures. I had forgotten all about the little pearl pen until you mentioned it. He had it the last I knew, and presume still has.

We had roast rabbit, dressing, mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce, string beans, baked apples & pumpkin pie. Mildred had to work from 12 to 5, so we didn't eat the turkey until after she came. The dressing was terribly salty, the beans not salty enough. The pumpkin custard was good, but the crust was tough. I ate a big dinner notwithstanding. I hemmed up a brown velvet dress for Mildred and did a little darning for myself. A near neighbor, Mrs Weisheyer and her married daughter, Dorothy, came in this afternoon and we had a pleasant visit. This was before our dinner. I called on my renter in the garage apt. last evening and he promised to help me out in the picking. I telephoned the express office and find the cost of shipping is 10 cents more a bushel than last year and the express to Milwaukee is $1.70 I telephoned Byrum this aft. and he said the price of fruit to be 25 cents more a bushel than last year.

What color? \n Again, I'm so happy over the return of your bill fold! \n Did I forget to tell you that Cousin Myrtle sent me the announcement of Cousin Elsie's youngest Eleanor's marriage? I didn't send any present, or acknowledge it to anyone but Myrtle, for I'm not acquainted with Kenneth and Elsie, never saw them. When I was \"down East\", visiting Cora and Libbie, I wrote Kenneth & Elsie asking if I might see them, Kenneth wrote that Elsie was expecting to be confined any time, and it wouldn't be convenient. I was chagrinned to have intruded as much as a letter even at such a time, so naturally I didn't see them. But I'm glad you know them and that you sent the luncheon set. And I'm glad Brouner isn't flying. \n  Yes, you and Maxine must have had a lovely trip to Lincoln Park and the Art Institute. It reminded me of the trips I was lucky enough to have with my grandsons to the Art Institute and Field","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118316,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118316","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/0e8b9912acf1e14d7afc8d9839b5f78d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/0e8b9912acf1e14d7afc8d9839b5f78d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/0e8b9912acf1e14d7afc8d9839b5f78d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0e8b9912acf1e14d7afc8d9839b5f78d.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:27:12+00:00","modified":"2021-03-13T00:34:49+00:00","filename":"0e8b9912acf1e14d7afc8d9839b5f78d.jpg","authentication":"cc49130d81dc7db24c23f8a8076370d2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_135_010_003_o2.jpg","size":1653918,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3198,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047886352581474535},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["230850-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["230850-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["230850-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0e8b9912acf1e14d7afc8d9839b5f78d.jpg","FileDateTime":1612459521,"FileSize":1653918,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3198\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3198,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:27:17","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.011111111111111112,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 23:08:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 23:08:50","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.491853,"ApertureValue":4.33985,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2771,"ExifImageLength":3119,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1382,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1382","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"3\nMrs. May Walden\n420 West Bell Street, Box 853\nAvon Park, Fla.\nMuseum when they were small. \n\n  I have forgotten - blame Old Age and General flightiness - to say thank you for the copies of the Tribune you sent.

She gets $18.00 per month, blind pension, and gives him $3.00 per week to buy groceries and tobacco, laundry, etc. He is very deaf and very British in his Lord-of-all-Creation attitude (they are both England born) as he irritates her in all manner","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118322,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118322","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5a481187ce14883db0e0006675bbaee3.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5a481187ce14883db0e0006675bbaee3.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5a481187ce14883db0e0006675bbaee3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5a481187ce14883db0e0006675bbaee3.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:27:26+00:00","modified":"2021-03-13T15:49:05+00:00","filename":"5a481187ce14883db0e0006675bbaee3.jpg","authentication":"a66366293b7997eb44c2c2d9ea2b486e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_135_012_003_o2.jpg","size":1636314,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3178,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04767481295014335},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["230949-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["230949-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["230949-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5a481187ce14883db0e0006675bbaee3.jpg","FileDateTime":1612459521,"FileSize":1636314,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3178\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3178,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:27:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.011111111111111112,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 23:09:49","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 23:09:49","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.491853,"ApertureValue":4.33985,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"SubSecTimeOriginal":61,"SubSecTimeDigitized":61,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2754,"ExifImageLength":3119,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1382,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1382","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"3\nMrs. May Walden\n420 West Bell Street, Box 853\nAvon Park, Fla.\nof ways, and she has a thin little voice that can't penetrate his stubbornness.

We've had very little rain and I've had to water my plants every night but two since you left. I had Mr. Putney here for her birthday on the 6th, and Mrs. Weatherly came in to eat with us, and I used the new yellow table linen. It is very attractive and everyone praises it. Mrs. Putney could feel of it and decided it was of very superior quality. She used to be employed in a London textile house when she was a young woman. She asked me to tell you how much she appreciated your lovely letter (she brought it with her for me to read, and expected to have me answer it for her, but her brother insisted upon answering it before she could come in) and how much she enjoyed your visit. She is sure you are a very fine woman, and I told her you certainly are. I had chicken, lots of gravy, b&b, peas, tomato salad, and tapioca cream.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118333,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118333","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f8f2737797b140b7a22d1f4ac34c9c01.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f8f2737797b140b7a22d1f4ac34c9c01.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f8f2737797b140b7a22d1f4ac34c9c01.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f8f2737797b140b7a22d1f4ac34c9c01.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:27:44+00:00","modified":"2021-03-14T03:52:38+00:00","filename":"f8f2737797b140b7a22d1f4ac34c9c01.jpg","authentication":"9954f3eeeceab0a6b818c11629b9cbba","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_135_015_004_o2.jpg","size":1582646,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3143,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046624656791694655},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231102-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231102-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231102-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f8f2737797b140b7a22d1f4ac34c9c01.jpg","FileDateTime":1612459522,"FileSize":1582646,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3143\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3143,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:27:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.011111111111111112,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 23:11:02","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 23:11:02","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.491853,"ApertureValue":4.33985,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"SubSecTimeOriginal":47,"SubSecTimeDigitized":47,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2738,"ExifImageLength":3136,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1382,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1382","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"2\nThen after she had a nap, she wanted to walk over to Mrs. Swearengens to see Miss Brown, who is bed fast, and who had said she wanted to see Mrs. Putney - Mrs. Weatherby gave her a nice pair of step ins and a hankie, and Mrs. Darcy, who works at the Public Utilities office, and lives next to Mrs. Weatherby, and brought her in and took her home, gave Mrs. Putney a lovely box of milk chocolates and a dollar.

I seem to have anticipated your wish in my last letter, but I didn't write anything of your father's early life. Perhaps you may not recall that his parents were both teachers who zealously favored education for the Negroes, so after their marriage they came to Georgia and were teaching when the Civil War broke out. I forget the name of the town where he was born, but he was very young when his parents had to escape to the North and were the last people to get through the lines before communications ceased. They then taught in different towns near Rockford, in Ill and Wisc. finally settling in Madison - I can't recall where Jamie was born, nor do I know the year he died. Maybe you do. I think your father graduated at 19, but I believe there was some hitch about it, and he didn't get his degree \nWasn't there some stock, so you won't  have to bear the expense of the $150? I'd be sorry to not have helped you out. I do not question your judgement, Dearie, but I hate to think that came out of your earnings.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118338,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118338","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/de0ac01fb6ac5bd422b38d21e5e0406b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/de0ac01fb6ac5bd422b38d21e5e0406b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/de0ac01fb6ac5bd422b38d21e5e0406b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/de0ac01fb6ac5bd422b38d21e5e0406b.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:27:50+00:00","modified":"2021-03-14T04:25:20+00:00","filename":"de0ac01fb6ac5bd422b38d21e5e0406b.jpg","authentication":"71a7968ad28e56a7d6a90a95c38f5c6d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_135_016_004_o2.jpg","size":1636099,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3109,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048726487020954695},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231155-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231155-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231155-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"de0ac01fb6ac5bd422b38d21e5e0406b.jpg","FileDateTime":1612459522,"FileSize":1636099,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3109\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3109,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:28:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.011111111111111112,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 23:11:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 23:11:55","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.491853,"ApertureValue":4.33985,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2737,"ExifImageLength":3169,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1382,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1382","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"2\nuntil a year or two later. But I'm not sure. Some faculty quarrel, I believe, and jealousy on the part of other professors. He was always a brilliant student, especially in literature and languages. Greek, Latin and especially French. Not at all given to athletics as an incident that happened when he was 13 or 14 proved. He dragged a heavy post for a long distance to make a baseball bat and it gave him an attack of pleurisy that almost cost him his life. (Papa said he was 10 yrs. old at that time) I'm afraid there is very little of this that you can use in an obituary, but it may interest you. I don't know that he even told you his story that shows his whimsical humor. It happened in the grade school when all pupils were obliged to sing in unison. He had absolutely no singing voice, and knew it, so didn't sing. He was reprimanded, but he remained, apparently, obstinate. For explanation, he quoted \"I'm saddest when I sing\", and it brought down the house. I forget what his punishment was, but that was the only time he was ever punished. Time paid no attention to the item. They belittle all items that have anything to do with socialism, Marxism, Communism, etc. so I wasn't surprised. So glad you have a considerate boss. Don't work too hard! Glad you like Strange Fruit. The next book is \"The Firing Squad\" which I'll pay for, for you. The membership requires purchase of 4 books a year, and I've had my 4.

The $50 came Sat. but couldn't get it until this aft. The bank was closed so I couldn't do what I mean to with the money - invest in war bonds. There is no use dreaming and speculating about going anywhere. I thought of going to Green Cove Springs - near Jax - for a little trip after I had cancelled my reservations for a room and board in Highlands. But I find the same difficulty. I can buy a ticket, but I may have to stand part way. I'd have to leave here a midnight and get here at 7 a.m. and wait from 1 1\/2 to 2 1\/2 hours in Haines City. When I contrast that discomfort with the quiet & conveniences of my own home, I gladly stay here. So I hope you will not be impatient with me \nyet back. Look for them Wednesday. Had no ice over Sunday. I was bathing when the ice man came and didn't hear their call - Today I showed him the buzzer and told him to ring that when he couldn't rouse me otherwise. So glad you had so many holidays and a good visit with the kids. Can almost tasted that cherry pie! Mr. Wells just finished painting the garage Sat. aft. It looks nice.

If I go to Lakeland or Lake Placid, or some little trip this summer, that will be all I care to risk. In fact, since I've given up the idea of going, I am quite happy to think I'm enjoying myself so much at home. Of course there is always the cleaning and sweeping and weeding, but none of it is unbearable. So why worry. Brought home from p.o. a new book to read. That Man in the White House - an attack against the conspirators who are trying to discredit the New Deal. That's another thing - if I went, I'd have to have the address changed of all the stuff I take, and have the annoyance of missing some of it, or not getting it until time to come home again, etc. etc. We'll hope I can go before I'm too blind & deaf and lame to enjoy myself - and if I can't, why I'll be too old enjoy it then anyway, so what's the difference?

As you've probably heard thirty thousand soldiers were evacuated from Fort Riley, Kansas, to escape the flood waters. Donald was one of them. They worked in water and mud above their knees in a vain attempt to build the dykes higher. Pillow cases and mattrass covers from their cots were used as sandbags. Now they are camping in pup tents in the hills where it's cold and foggy. Technically  we're not \"at war\" so the Government gives only one complete uniform. The boys must buy all replacements and extras (socks, belts, shirts, ties, shaving equipment, shine kits, towels, laundry and bath soap) themselves, pay own laundry, pressing and cleaning bills, fresh white towels for daily inspection, etc. They don't have passes to the theatres, etc., and they must buy their stationery, stamps, ink, etc. Mail comes through seven to ten days late. One mess truck feeds each three thousand soldiers: two lean meals of poor quality a day. They're hungry all the time. We've sent food but they're slow getting through to him. Veterans can scarcely believe that most of the present soldiers pay goes for so many things they got free. It seems like a money-making racket for schemers. Sorry, but I felt you'd share my feelings. Love, Dorrie\" This recital is only a small part of what thousands of our boys are going through.

He apologized for Murl that she hadn't stopped to do it before she left when on her vacation - So they are about to get things fixed up now to transfer the old cottage to a young family by the name of Singleterry and take the Singleterry trailer as part payment. Ward had on new clothes, shoes, etc and acted like $1,000,000. He hopes to get matters settled in a day or so. Later. He came back in aft. to have receipt altered to $46.40 as he forgot that. Yours of 30th came this morning. So glad the fruit proves satisfactory in every way. No, I didn't make the little mat. I found it at the Davis Dimestore. Yes, I did make the little tray. Longleaf pine needles were plentiful then, but the trees are about extinct now. Glad the M.&L.'s didn't bring the white kitten. It will be much happier at near home. I'm sure you will enjoy the walks with Mitzie, and I hope they will have a fine vacation. The exchange of presents was very pleasurable, I'm sure the dining room table must look swell with it's lace tablecloth. Yes, I've thought of the Metamora paper but rejected it on acc. of Frank.

I put your picture on the radio, went out and gathered a little boquet of pentas, verbenas, 2 rain lilies and some rose geranium and put it in a little white vase beside the picture so I could look at it and talk to you all day. I got a lot of pleasure out of it. Then I meant to write out my recollections of the Day, 60 years ago. But I'll do it now. It was a very hot day. For \"hired girl\" I had Anna - who left Mrs. Gary Wheaton (Mrs. Judge) to come to me, as it was impossible to get a good girl. I think we paid her $12.00 per week. She was very neat, willing and efficient. I knew before we got up that morning that I was in for it that day but I said nothing to Papa as I didn't want him worrying all day. He had enough to worry about with his business. I kept about, not too uncomfortable, until about 4 p.m. when I had Anna telephone him to bring Dr. Martin out with him. Being old college friends they had a good time eating dinner together. About the time dinner was over I began to feel pretty bad. They hurried upstairs and jested while giving me attention. One remark that Papa made always stuck with m. It was apprepo of sterilizing something and he said even the dish-cloth had to be sanctified - he laughed considerably over that. Your head was born before Dr. Martin realized it. She disputed me when I told them you were coming and I said sharply \"But I know better\" So she hurried to receive you and Anna took care of you until Dr. M. could. The afterbirth came quickly, tho painfully too, and the affair ended happily. Anna staid until Mother came. She staid 6 weeks and we got Cousin Carrie who staid nearly - we quite awhile. We had a black cocker spaniel Papa named Puck. He followed Mother onto the train one day. The conductor put him off at Lombard and we never saw him again - Much love, Mother.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118385,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118385","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/11384964d32fd377ea6230f08441d859.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/11384964d32fd377ea6230f08441d859.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/11384964d32fd377ea6230f08441d859.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/11384964d32fd377ea6230f08441d859.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:29:19+00:00","modified":"2021-03-17T20:48:14+00:00","filename":"11384964d32fd377ea6230f08441d859.jpg","authentication":"9e31bbb894c2f40adb7ead19a6e2eea1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_137_002_001_o2.jpg","size":1445993,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3145,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04257177766001295},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231907-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231907-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231907-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"11384964d32fd377ea6230f08441d859.jpg","FileDateTime":1612459524,"FileSize":1445993,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3145\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3145,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:30:00","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.011111111111111112,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 23:19:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 23:19:07","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.491853,"ApertureValue":4.33985,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2755,"ExifImageLength":3153,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.3333435058594,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1382,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1382","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Mrs. May Walden\n420 West Bell Street\nAvon Park, Fla. \nAug. 5, 1954\nAncient One,\nYour letter with H.'s check here yesterday.

Your letter with 5.00 enclosed here last Wed Thanks very much for both. That day I spent with Cora Wray from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the library sorting out photographs to be displayed. She came home with me and we worked until nearly 11 p.m. mounting some in our album. She called taxi to get home. She has bright idea of offering to school kids prized to the movie for those who can identify their parents or g-parents in the photos. It has been something of a struggle for her and me to get these photos displayed again. Our young president Paul Jordan, not a forceful personality, argued for a speaker instead. He wrote 2 or 3 weeks ago to Mr. McKay the T.T. historian, who edits a whole page for every Sunday, to address our O.A.C.

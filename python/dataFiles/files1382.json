I went out several times and picked up the King oranges that have blown off - got nearly a bushel, many weighing close to a pound. Wish you had them. I eat all I can, but there are many to give away.  They crack as they fall, then the ants and flies get into them in a short time and they are ruined. There is no sale for them. Those on the trees might as well be taken off - Do you want some?      My ankle is very sore this evening as I've pottered around such a lot today. Had a letter from Mrs Griffeth written from Glendale - a suburb of Los Angeles - four days after the quake. She was unhurt, but badly frightened. Friends of hers in Long Beach wrapped themselves in blankets and staid in autos on the mountainsides and haven't yet had their clothes off! These people couldn't go back to their apts until they had been inspected and pronounced safe, as the walls were cracked. I think I prefer to risk the hurricanes to the earthquakes! \n So glad to get your letter yesterday. Thanks for the stamps.

I think Woodford didn't join in, as we had good grounds and buildings for many years. The clock has struck eight. The paper has just come. I wanted to begin a chapter on my early political opinions, but it must wait. \nJan.19.  So you attended a Townsend club meeting? I went to their district meeting Thursday afternoon out of curiosity, and took notes for Dr. Brewster.   He couldn't go. They say they have no intention of advocating a third party. They have the same tactic that Upton Sinclair employs - use old party candidates but get them to endorse their platform. Such things never work. An old time politician has too many Capitalist ideas firmly embedded in his brain cells to be able to keep his promises, even if he knows how to use his vote. I encourage the idea of pensions, not only for old people, but for everybody. I [unclear] the mere fact of getting together on an economic idea is a step ahead for many people, so I favor it, but I have not joined the club. \n\n  You have done much more writing for the public than I. I have written letters and diaries voluminously, but very little otherwise, and some of it is out of print. You seem more than ever like home folks - only please, don't get sentimental - when you mention the Wesleyan at Bloomington, only 16 miles from old Metamora. I have a very dear friend who lives now, and has for years in Normal. Had a letter this past week from her. She taught me music for several years. Yes, I recall the Overland Monthly and the Woman's Magazine and the Daily. I was in St. L. at the time of the Fair there and took my little daughter. We went to the development and heard the publisher - wasn't his name Lewis? - give an address. He was a clever schemer, but little more, and was on the decline at the time. Your thrill over the Lahore, India paper reminds me of one I had - an article which was syndicated in a Chicago paper was translated into Spanish for an educational monthly there, then re-translated into English and printed in some school paper here in the U.S. My father-in-law Prof. Alexander Kerr, who was professor emeritus at Wisconsin U. after teaching Greek there 39 years, found the article and gave me the copy. It has been lost in all these years of moving about, but the subject of the paper was teaching children by suggestion, and founded upon the experiences and successes I had with my own Katherine. I cured her of thumb-sucking as well as some other things. I'm glad you wrote for Daniel De Leon's N.Y.

But I notice the Conscription Bill says Hemispheric, so they will find plenty of places for them to go.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118276,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118276","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/72d482dbec18bb4bbdf559daef83b3c4.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/72d482dbec18bb4bbdf559daef83b3c4.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/72d482dbec18bb4bbdf559daef83b3c4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/72d482dbec18bb4bbdf559daef83b3c4.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:26:01+00:00","modified":"2021-06-14T21:36:21+00:00","filename":"72d482dbec18bb4bbdf559daef83b3c4.jpg","authentication":"7821108094dda74dd960afc1f9a7d760","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_134_008_005_o2.jpg","size":1654600,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3198,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04790609871910685158002962680257041938602924346923828125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["230238-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["230238-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["230238-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"72d482dbec18bb4bbdf559daef83b3c4.jpg","FileDateTime":1612459519,"FileSize":1654600,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3198\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3198,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:25:41","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01111111111111111153515462746099728974513709545135498046875,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 23:02:38","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 23:02:38","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.49185299999999987363707987242378294467926025390625,"ApertureValue":4.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"SubSecTimeOriginal":97,"SubSecTimeDigitized":97,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2771,"ExifImageLength":3119,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1382,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1382","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Mrs. May Walden\n420 West Bell Street, Box 853\nAvon Park, Fla.\nI am glad you were pleased to have the pin and the dishtowels.

I hadn't had a penny in my purse for three days, and Foster's rent due, but hasn't paid yet. He came to apologize for forgetting, made a date when he would pay, and haven't seen him since. His wife and baby went a week ago to visit her mother. Maybe he has gone after them. So you see how welcome the check was. It was spent except for 42 c[ents] in a few minutes, as I needed kerosene and groceries. Byrum took me to Sebring one day last week where I applied for Old Age Assistance.

I have for years looked out of my windows and have seen beautiful things made more beautiful by the varied changes of the seen light and shadows on vines and trees and clouds. I look on my mantle, and see an old pewter mug with a glass bottom that brings to mind an old English gentleman who gave it to me, and who taught me to appreciate Art in many forms, and to see beauty in many things, hitherto unsuspected of me. \nThe old pewter mug, not kept bright and shiny, but tarnished by years of service, was given as a prize to this man- he was proud of his Irish ancestry and insisted upon being called Shammus, which he said means James- for winning a rowing contest on the Thames and, he said, was presented by Charles

Just Read a letter from E Harriett Donlevy Cors Sec. for the World Wide Broadcasting Foundation telling me Professor Scammell after 5 months, had turned my letter over to these to answer. She said he is a full-time professor at Boston unclear, a Lay Preacher and a broadcaster and hasn't time to do all the things he wants to do. She wrote \"your story of the pewter mug was delightful. Perhaps more so to me because I collect early American pewter and have quite a collection for an amateur, and one who must collect thriftily. I have no glass-bottom mugs, but several small mugs and a communion cup and chalice.

We had roast rabbit, dressing, mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce, string beans, baked apples & pumpkin pie. Mildred had to work from 12 to 5, so we didn't eat the turkey until after she came. The dressing was terribly salty, the beans not salty enough. The pumpkin custard was good, but the crust was tough. I ate a big dinner notwithstanding. I hemmed up a brown velvet dress for Mildred and did a little darning for myself. A near neighbor, Mrs Weisheyer and her married daughter, Dorothy, came in this afternoon and we had a pleasant visit. This was before our dinner. I called on my renter in the garage apt. last evening and he promised to help me out in the picking. I telephoned the express office and find the cost of shipping is 10 cents more a bushel than last year and the express to Milwaukee is $1.70 I telephoned Byrum this aft. and he said the price of fruit to be 25 cents more a bushel than last year.

Don't worry over it my dear - have Mr. F. take another and hold your head naturally, and the picture will be fine. I suppose relatives take advantage of their relationship and are brutally frank, when instead they should practice a little finesse, or whatever it is that properly behaved relatives do. But you are a darling girl under any and all circumstances, and I'm proud that you have preserved  your youthful figure. No one who has seen your big photograph will believe that you are a grandmother. \"O, she's beautiful!\" they all say.

I had Mrs. Putney here for her birthday on the 6th, and Mrs. Weatherly came in to eat with us, and I used the new yellow table linen. It is very attractive and everyone praises it. Mrs. Putney could feel of it and decided it was of very superior quality. She used to be employed in a London textile house when she was a young woman. She asked me to tell you how much she appreciated your lovely letter (she brought it with her for me to read, and expected to have me answer it for her, but her brother insisted upon answering it before she could come in) and how much she enjoyed your visit. She is sure you are a very fine woman, and I told her you certainly are. I had chicken, lots of gravy, b&b, peas, tomato salad, and tapioca cream.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118333,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118333","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f8f2737797b140b7a22d1f4ac34c9c01.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f8f2737797b140b7a22d1f4ac34c9c01.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f8f2737797b140b7a22d1f4ac34c9c01.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f8f2737797b140b7a22d1f4ac34c9c01.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:27:44+00:00","modified":"2021-03-14T03:52:38+00:00","filename":"f8f2737797b140b7a22d1f4ac34c9c01.jpg","authentication":"9954f3eeeceab0a6b818c11629b9cbba","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_135_015_004_o2.jpg","size":1582646,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3143,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04662465679169465471165523240415495820343494415283203125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231102-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231102-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231102-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f8f2737797b140b7a22d1f4ac34c9c01.jpg","FileDateTime":1612459522,"FileSize":1582646,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3143\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3143,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:27:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01111111111111111153515462746099728974513709545135498046875,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 23:11:02","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 23:11:02","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.49185299999999987363707987242378294467926025390625,"ApertureValue":4.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"SubSecTimeOriginal":47,"SubSecTimeDigitized":47,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2738,"ExifImageLength":3136,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1382,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1382","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"2\nThen after she had a nap, she wanted to walk over to Mrs. Swearengens to see Miss Brown, who is bed fast, and who had said she wanted to see Mrs. Putney -

I get on very well with my couple. They go before seven and don't get back until 6:30. It is rather troublesome on their one day off each week when Lucille washes and irons. This week I had to make blueberry muffins for my dinner when she had 6 dresses plus a lot of other things to iron, and she was considerably in my way. She apologized, and I responded amiably, so we got on o.k. My worst complaint is the cigarette smoke they both make when they are home, and the fact that neither of them clean out the wash basin or the bath tub after using them - I've put up with it so far without murmuring, but it's hard on me to clean the bath tub.

I didn't go in town yesterday as it was so hot, but Lucille Wells brought it when she came home from breakfast. I seem to have anticipated your wish in my last letter, but I didn't write anything of your father's early life. Perhaps you may not recall that his parents were both teachers who zealously favored education for the Negroes, so after their marriage they came to Georgia and were teaching when the Civil War broke out. I forget the name of the town where he was born, but he was very young when his parents had to escape to the North and were the last people to get through the lines before communications ceased. They then taught in different towns near Rockford, in Ill and Wisc. finally settling in Madison - I can't recall where Jamie was born, nor do I know the year he died. Maybe you do. I think your father graduated at 19, but I believe there was some hitch about it, and he didn't get his degree \nWasn't there some stock, so you won't  have to bear the expense of the $150? I'd be sorry to not have helped you out. I do not question your judgement, Dearie, but I hate to think that came out of your earnings.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118338,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118338","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/de0ac01fb6ac5bd422b38d21e5e0406b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/de0ac01fb6ac5bd422b38d21e5e0406b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/de0ac01fb6ac5bd422b38d21e5e0406b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/de0ac01fb6ac5bd422b38d21e5e0406b.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:27:50+00:00","modified":"2021-03-14T04:25:20+00:00","filename":"de0ac01fb6ac5bd422b38d21e5e0406b.jpg","authentication":"71a7968ad28e56a7d6a90a95c38f5c6d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_135_016_004_o2.jpg","size":1636099,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3109,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0487264870209546951951296023253235034644603729248046875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231155-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231155-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231155-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"de0ac01fb6ac5bd422b38d21e5e0406b.jpg","FileDateTime":1612459522,"FileSize":1636099,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3109\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3109,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:28:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01111111111111111153515462746099728974513709545135498046875,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 23:11:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 23:11:55","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.49185299999999987363707987242378294467926025390625,"ApertureValue":4.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2737,"ExifImageLength":3169,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1382,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1382","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"2\nuntil a year or two later. But I'm not sure. Some faculty quarrel, I believe, and jealousy on the part of other professors. He was always a brilliant student, especially in literature and languages. Greek, Latin and especially French. Not at all given to athletics as an incident that happened when he was 13 or 14 proved. He dragged a heavy post for a long distance to make a baseball bat and it gave him an attack of pleurisy that almost cost him his life. (Papa said he was 10 yrs. old at that time) I'm afraid there is very little of this that you can use in an obituary, but it may interest you. I don't know that he even told you his story that shows his whimsical humor. It happened in the grade school when all pupils were obliged to sing in unison. He had absolutely no singing voice, and knew it, so didn't sing. He was reprimanded, but he remained, apparently, obstinate. For explanation, he quoted \"I'm saddest when I sing\", and it brought down the house. I forget what his punishment was, but that was the only time he was ever punished. Time paid no attention to the item. They belittle all items that have anything to do with socialism, Marxism, Communism, etc. so I wasn't surprised. So glad you have a considerate boss.

I'd have to leave here at midnight, reach G.C.S. at 4a.m. leave there at midnight and get here at 7 a.m. and wait from 1 1\/2 to 2 1\/2 hours in Haines City.

Tuesday night I went to bed before eight, then got up at 1:30 and heard to my amazement the returns coming in for Truman over Dewey. But the big cities had not yet been heard from, so I suppose Dewey would be elected. I forgot all about the election during the day as I was busy cleaning, weeding, etc until Gene came in the afternoon to fix the fitting on the garden hose.

He told me that Dewey had conceded defeat and I was so exhilarated over the fact that Dewey had lost that I can forgive Truman for a whole lot of things.

I suppose Dos and Ann are freezing somewhere tonight on the way down. I know you are worried about the transaction and it may help a little for you to know I have written the county Assessor all about it and asked for instructions. Every year he sends out cards to property owners for a renewal of the application for Homestead Exemption, statement of personal property, and sales, and if any changes from last year we have to explain the change.

As you've probably heard thirty thousand soldiers were evacuated from Fort Riley, Kansas, to escape the flood waters. Donald was one of them. They worked in water and mud above their knees in a vain attempt to build the dykes higher. Pillow cases and mattrass covers from their cots were used as sandbags. Now they are camping in pup tents in the hills where it's cold and foggy. Technically  we're not \"at war\" so the Government gives only one complete uniform. The boys must buy all replacements and extras (socks, belts, shirts, ties, shaving equipment, shine kits, towels, laundry and bath soap) themselves, pay own laundry, pressing and cleaning bills, fresh white towels for daily inspection, etc. They don't have passes to the theatres, etc., and they must buy their stationery, stamps, ink, etc. Mail comes through seven to ten days late. One mess truck feeds each three thousand soldiers: two lean meals of poor quality a day. They're hungry all the time. We've sent food but they're slow getting through to him. Veterans can scarcely believe that most of the present soldiers pay goes for so many things they got free. It seems like a money-making racket for schemers. Sorry, but I felt you'd share my feelings. Love, Dorrie\" This recital is only a small part of what thousands of our boys are going through.

The Slaughters are certainly lovely people. Miss Avis was attending a history convention. That was the reason we didn't see her Thursday evening.

Hope your poor bottom isn't suffering too much. Wish my thoughts could help! Went to town early and did my marketing, bread, beans, lettuce tomatoes at the B&B.  Spied a nice porch rocker like one - the best one - that is on the porch now. Has nice high back, so I bought it in commemoration of your visit. Shall think of it as Tafern's rocker.

I put your picture on the radio, went out and gathered a little boquet of pentas, verbenas, 2 rain lilies and some rose geranium and put it in a little white vase beside the picture so I could look at it and talk to you all day. I got a lot of pleasure out of it. Then I meant to write out my recollections of the Day, 60 years ago. But I'll do it now. It was a very hot day. For \"hired girl\" I had Anna - who left Mrs. Gary Wheaton (Mrs. Judge) to come to me, as it was impossible to get a good girl. I think we paid her $12.00 per week. She was very neat, willing and efficient. I knew before we got up that morning that I was in for it that day but I said nothing to Papa as I didn't want him worrying all day. He had enough to worry about with his business. I kept about, not too uncomfortable, until about 4 p.m. when I had Anna telephone him to bring Dr. Martin out with him. Being old college friends they had a good time eating dinner together. About the time dinner was over I began to feel pretty bad. They hurried upstairs and jested while giving me attention. One remark that Papa made always stuck with m. It was apprepo of sterilizing something and he said even the dish-cloth had to be sanctified - he laughed considerably over that. Your head was born before Dr. Martin realized it. She disputed me when I told them you were coming and I said sharply \"But I know better\" So she hurried to receive you and Anna took care of you until Dr. M. could. The afterbirth came quickly, tho painfully too, and the affair ended happily. Anna staid until Mother came. She staid 6 weeks and we got Cousin Carrie who staid nearly - we quite awhile. We had a black cocker spaniel Papa named Puck. He followed Mother onto the train one day. The conductor put him off at Lombard and we never saw him again - Much love, Mother.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118385,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118385","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/11384964d32fd377ea6230f08441d859.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/11384964d32fd377ea6230f08441d859.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/11384964d32fd377ea6230f08441d859.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/11384964d32fd377ea6230f08441d859.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:29:19+00:00","modified":"2021-03-17T20:48:14+00:00","filename":"11384964d32fd377ea6230f08441d859.jpg","authentication":"9e31bbb894c2f40adb7ead19a6e2eea1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_137_002_001_o2.jpg","size":1445993,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3145,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04257177766001295216025113177238381467759609222412109375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231907-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231907-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["231907-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"11384964d32fd377ea6230f08441d859.jpg","FileDateTime":1612459524,"FileSize":1445993,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3145\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3145,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:30:00","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01111111111111111153515462746099728974513709545135498046875,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 23:19:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 23:19:07","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.49185299999999987363707987242378294467926025390625,"ApertureValue":4.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2755,"ExifImageLength":3153,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1382,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1382","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Mrs. May Walden\n420 West Bell Street\nAvon Park, Fla. \nAug. 5, 1954\nAncient One,\nYour letter with H.'s check here yesterday.

Your letter with 5.00 enclosed here last Wed Thanks very much for both. That day I spent with Cora Wray from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the library sorting out photographs to be displayed. She came home with me and we worked until nearly 11 p.m. mounting some in our album. She called taxi to get home. She has bright idea of offering to school kids prized to the movie for those who can identify their parents or g-parents in the photos. It has been something of a struggle for her and me to get these photos displayed again. Our young president Paul Jordan, not a forceful personality, argued for a speaker instead. He wrote 2 or 3 weeks ago to Mr. McKay the T.T. historian, who edits a whole page for every Sunday, to address our O.A.C.

So I plugged in in the kitchen and by the time the oatmeal was ready, the temp had reached 60 degrees. I put the heater close to Frank so he wouldn't freeze. As soo as bkfst was over he went out, found a limb that needed cutting off and worked it up. He is enjoying the heat from it now. He has two suits that need some alterations and two extra vests that Hartman gave him. I have tried to get someone to do the work and finally found that the Harris Cleaning Co. does it.

I read the editorials if I can find the time, and some of the reports of their correspondents over seas. today we had a time over his clothes. He had 4 vests at the Harris cleaners and 2 pairs of pants for alterations & cleaning. I paid the bill and told him I'd call it his b-day present, as had given him nothing. In Tampa we bought a nice light pair of pants for $10.00 for him - they didn't cost as much as that, but that is what I gave him to pay for them. He ahs worn them every day, swaying, splitting wood, weeding, etc. out in the wet early in the morning and he is careless about eating and already had spots in front on them.

I hear Old Bertie is dead! Wonder if the world is any better off for his having lived? Old Pulitzer was a much better force than McCormick - singular that two such prominent publishers should pass out almost at once.

He is wonderful to them, kisses them always when they meet and wants to love them.\nHappy New Year!\nMuch love to all,\nMother","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118461,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118461","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d2f4f8dabefad6a18f07a595fe3e8a71.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d2f4f8dabefad6a18f07a595fe3e8a71.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d2f4f8dabefad6a18f07a595fe3e8a71.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d2f4f8dabefad6a18f07a595fe3e8a71.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:31:06+00:00","modified":"2021-02-05T19:25:33+00:00","filename":"d2f4f8dabefad6a18f07a595fe3e8a71.jpg","authentication":"6e47e27ab6541f9569f1b86d33f4cb18","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_137_021_005_o2.jpg","size":1466352,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3109,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.043671062506700976391105228913147584535181522369384765625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["232838-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["232838-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["232838-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d2f4f8dabefad6a18f07a595fe3e8a71.jpg","FileDateTime":1612459527,"FileSize":1466352,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3109\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3109,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:33:00","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01111111111111111153515462746099728974513709545135498046875,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 23:28:38","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 23:28:38","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.49185299999999987363707987242378294467926025390625,"ApertureValue":4.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2737,"ExifImageLength":3169,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1382,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1382","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]

The rest of the sky was clear.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":30270,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/30270","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c99ab237cbbd4783a6e5b8182c5369af.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c99ab237cbbd4783a6e5b8182c5369af.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c99ab237cbbd4783a6e5b8182c5369af.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c99ab237cbbd4783a6e5b8182c5369af.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-09T15:31:19+00:00","modified":"2020-04-25T15:36:07+00:00","filename":"c99ab237cbbd4783a6e5b8182c5369af.jpg","authentication":"4bbba894adfe99a50f340ee67c4b9d66","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_06_fl_200_007_01_o2.jpg","size":990962,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2209,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04153722985094600306243961540531017817556858062744140625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["020354"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["020354"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["020354"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c99ab237cbbd4783a6e5b8182c5369af.jpg","FileDateTime":1507563036,"FileSize":990962,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2209\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2209,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"9mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:02:18 16:51:46","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:17 02:03:54","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:17 02:03:54","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1553,"ExifImageLength":2530,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":126,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/126","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Remsen, Dec. 13. 1864\n\nDear Sister,\n\n    If you have been wondering why I have not yet gone to Utica you must have better weather there for going out than we have here.

Are you not delighted? I suppose you are all very busy now, preparing for the meeting. Do you believe Eddie, I have allowed myself to be really sad and homesick because I could not be with you to enjoy the meetings this week, but never mind, it would be wrong to reprise, I hope to be at home again before\nHow is Lizzie?","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":30427,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/30427","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f5276004fd61fc1f9154e00f82f706f2.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f5276004fd61fc1f9154e00f82f706f2.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f5276004fd61fc1f9154e00f82f706f2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f5276004fd61fc1f9154e00f82f706f2.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-09T15:38:19+00:00","modified":"2020-05-11T20:00:32+00:00","filename":"f5276004fd61fc1f9154e00f82f706f2.jpg","authentication":"e8aa07d23d3d0133890580ccc40127a1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_06_fl_201_001_02_o2.jpg","size":1065282,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2343,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04209868639446100180290244452407932840287685394287109375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["034329"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["034329"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160217"],"TimeCreated":["034329"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f5276004fd61fc1f9154e00f82f706f2.jpg","FileDateTime":1507563041,"FileSize":1065282,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2343\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2343,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"10mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:02:18 16:55:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:17 03:43:29","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:17 03:43:29","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1648,"ExifImageLength":2532,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":126,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/126","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"a great while, I am really gaining nicely.

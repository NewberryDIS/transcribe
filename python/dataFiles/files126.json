The trees before had been covered with ice which appeared to have been transformed into myriads of sparking diamonds.  The snow too seemed whiter than its wont and as I stooped to look upon it, I could see the little flakes nestling there all unchanged by the suns rays.  They were star-formed, diamond and leaf like. I gazed a long time at the fairy scene wishing you were with me to enjoy it too.  Then I came in to see if none of the girls would not like to go out but they were not in the mood and when I went out again the sun was hid behind a heavy cloud which lay all around the horizon reminding me of those clouds we saw as we were riding to Trenton that day you didn't go back to Whitestown which looked, you said, as tho' all the light clouds had been pressed down into them.

Hampton May 13. 1858\nDear Mother;\nYour kind letter containing $.15. was rec'd last Saturday. Pa was very kind to send so much. I was very glad to get it though. We have had a great time this week, starting home. Packed Monday, was too tired to go Tuesday, Wednesday it rained. E. was not willing for me to start today and so it is. I do want to see you Ma, so much. I fear from your letter that you are quite feeble. We feel quite anxious about you and Sarah.\nI have not been very strong of late, E thinks that if I wait a week or so longer I shall be better able to endure the journey.

This cow-plough, though evidently superior to any contrivance for picking up or catching the cow, does not always do it's work.  Not far from the town of Jackson, we came up with one of these poor animals that happened to be lying on the rails.  On this occasion the plough went over it, & so did the first two or three carriages; til at last the unhappy brute got fast fixed among the springs & wheels of the car I was in.  The train was stopped & the cow taken out, which though horribly mangled, proved to be still alive.  The conductor called out for the loan of a pistol to enable him to put it out of its misery.  In an instant, almost from every window on that side the train a hand was extended offering the desired instrument.

It was during the night, but she wd not have anyone called off from other work to do for her what she was still capable of doing for herself; she therefore held with her left hand the lamp which lighted the surgeon to amputate her shattered right arm.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":59029,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/59029","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/539433ac09b02606fd4f697bc521371a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/539433ac09b02606fd4f697bc521371a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/539433ac09b02606fd4f697bc521371a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/539433ac09b02606fd4f697bc521371a.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-15T16:42:22+00:00","modified":"2020-01-28T21:29:22+00:00","filename":"539433ac09b02606fd4f697bc521371a.jpg","authentication":"6829bb7e36627cde8c6c707f8536346d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":12,"original_filename":"GR_4799_0117_o2.jpg","size":693562,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1872,"resolution_y":2293,"compression_ratio":0.053858485443745},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"539433ac09b02606fd4f697bc521371a.jpg","FileDateTime":1521132128,"FileSize":693562,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1872\" height=\"2293\"","Height":2293,"Width":1872,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2293,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:15 09:58:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":236},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":386,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":8044},"EXIF":{"ExifVersion":221,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1872,"ExifImageLength":2293}}}},"item":{"id":944,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/944","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"193  \nI arrived at Cairo by steamer at three oclock? in the morning.

(the Ohio itself not far above this point is joined by more large streams) it became a very important military station.  But it was necessary to create a site for a town, for the locality itself supplied nothing of the kind.  This was done by raising a levee, forty feet high, & then, behind this, making streets in the form of embankments at right angles to the levee, there streets again being intersected by other embankments parallel to the levee.  The whole space that was reclaimed was thus divided by these embankments into hollow squares, each of which is intended for a block of buildings.  At present very few of these blocks have been raised, but the streets, that is the embankments, with in some instances, planked unclear at their sides, are finished.

In the Western towns you will see street after street in which half, or more than half, the names are German.  They have their own Hotels, their own newspapers, their own theatres. It seems a greater invasion than that of the Roman Empire by their Fathers.  That overthrew the Empire, & for a time disorganized society, however it did not extend the language of the Fatherland into Italy, Spain, or France.  But here is a continuous stream of between 200,000 & 300,000 every year, coming, not with sword & torch, to slay & to burn, or to perish themselves, but with the ax & the plough, to clear away the forest, & to cultivate the soil.  Every one that comes is taken up into that entity which will be the America of the Future.  What then will be the effect?

One sees the working of this in many different ways.  For instance it evidently elevates the unclear & character of the classes which they find themselves at the head of Society.  It gives them a dignity & a bearing they wd not otherwise possess.  If there is no one higher in society than a retail shop keeper, then by the force of his position he becomes brave & liberal, & his ideas become enlarged.  I observed this at Denver where there is no higher class.  And I think the same observations cd be made by anyone who wd go so far to judge for himself.  These are good effects which the American system has upon those also who are most humbly placed.  As they feel that they are theoretically, & in some respect practically, equal to those who are even the best placed in society, they endeavour not to disgrace, or altogether to fall short of their position.  This is a strong stimulus among them to education & self-improvement.  It is what has unclear the efforts of many who hae risen in life, & sustained them through many long years of patient industry, & laborious enterprise.  I have no reason to believe a word of all that I ever heard of the offensive self assertion?, & obtrusive incivility of this class, for I never myself suffered from, or unclear any thing of the kind.

I tasted two wines, sparkling Catawba, & a red California wine which are really good now, & which no doubt in course of time will become still better.  The former was a little too sweet, but that is a fault, if it be regarded as a fault in America, which can easily be remedied by carrying the process of fermentation a little further.  There is every prospect of a larger proportion of America, than of Europe, producing wine; in that case the same proportion of its inhabitants will become a wine, & not a beer, or spirit drinking population.  In Europe we attribute certain differences of national character to this difference in the beverage of a people.  It appears as if in this highly favoured region, upon which Nature has heaped all her gifts, that nothing in the way of climate, occupation, or even food which can diversity life & character will be wanting.

Americanization in these particulars takes place in the second or third generation.  They were cleanly? clearly? & orderly, & looked well clothed & well fed.  In the Illinois system there are ten grades, the tenth is the lowest in the primary school, unclear & the first the highest in the Grammar School.  No copy slips are used in these schools.  They write at first from something set before them on the Black board.  When sufficiently advanced they write each day from memory something they were taught on the previous day.  In Chicago the number of children attending school falls very far short indeed of the number of those who are of an age to attend.  This is what might have been expected in a town that has grown to such dimensions in a single generation.  Great efforts however are being made to overtake the work.  The difficulty just at present is to get School buildings quickly enough.

At New Orleans it was of the colour of a Mulatto, at Cincinnati of a Mistizo, & at the intermediate places of the intermediate shades.  At Richmond it had a kind of ochcreous? tint.  The reason is the same everywhere.  The wells, with the water of which the towns are supplied, all run through a yellowish or reddish loamy soil, sometimes sandy, sometimes clayey.  This is easily worn away, & carried off in suspension by the stream, and is largely added to after rains, by the surface washing of the country.  At Chicago by a boldly conceived, & most successfully carried out plan the whole city is supplied with the purest water.  A tunnel, large enough for two mules to work abreast in it, was carried out for a distance of two miles beneath the Lake.  At this point they have reached water which is perfectly free from all the impurities of the shore; & here it is admitted into the tunnel in sufficient volume to supply all the wants of a population of about 280,000 souls.

For being on the Pacific Railway, the grandest of all railways, as well as on that grandest of all arterial lines of water communication, the Missouri, which is navigable for a thousand miles beyond the town, for the same steamer that might have ascended the stream from New Orleans, it must soon become the depot for the two greatest lines of American traffic - that between the East & the West, & that between the North & the South, which all? will? cross here.

They did not, however, prove of the the slightest use for they were quite unable to arrest any body, or to hinder any thing.

I never met with any thing of the kind, except among classes which with as are generally too ignorant to know much, & too apathetic to care much about their own Country. The upper classes are proud of their country, as they ought to be, & that is all. At Boston, however, I was struck not with the arrogance & conceit, but with the humility of Americans. I confine this remark to the literary class; & I think the phenomenon is to be accounted for in the following way. These New Englanders are the most observant, & the most receptive of the human family. All of the literary class have travelled in England, & on the European Continent. These are to them the Holy Land of thought. It is here that all the branches of Literature, & all the departments of Science, unclear, & were matured. All the creators of Fancy, all the unclear & examples of History, all the familiar descriptors? of outward nature, or of human emotions come from this side. Here then are the shrines to which the literary man of the new world must come with the staff, & in the spirit, of a pilgrim. They feel an influence which their fellow countrymen do not feel.

Our two Schools of Eton & Harrow cost the Parents of the children educated at them more than these 10,000 Schools cost the people of Illinois.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":59191,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/59191","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/02372a40064b4b0f1f7c9ae1cbfb22b6.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/02372a40064b4b0f1f7c9ae1cbfb22b6.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/02372a40064b4b0f1f7c9ae1cbfb22b6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/02372a40064b4b0f1f7c9ae1cbfb22b6.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-15T16:44:32+00:00","modified":"2020-04-15T23:13:45+00:00","filename":"02372a40064b4b0f1f7c9ae1cbfb22b6.jpg","authentication":"e9f289813c2d63ef2a1f3f3f84f1b3a0","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":174,"original_filename":"GR_4799_0252_o2.jpg","size":625380,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1872,"resolution_y":2323,"compression_ratio":0.047936649852276},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"02372a40064b4b0f1f7c9ae1cbfb22b6.jpg","FileDateTime":1521132133,"FileSize":625380,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1872\" height=\"2323\"","Height":2323,"Width":1872,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2323,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":336,"YResolution":336,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:15 10:00:57","Exif_IFD_Pointer":236},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":386,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":7025},"EXIF":{"ExifVersion":221,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1872,"ExifImageLength":2323}}}},"item":{"id":944,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/944","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"352\nAnd when we came to look into the working of the American School system in the Cities, we see that nothing could be done without the motives I have spoken of as never failing to bring about one uniform result in the country.

They teach their scholars to write with to much care, that we may be sure they will never forget, or lay aside the use of the pen; & they teach them to read with to much care, & so much with the understanding, that we may be sure they will continue to read when they have left school.

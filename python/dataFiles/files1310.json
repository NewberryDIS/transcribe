Of the doctrine of future rewards and punishments, there are three or four distinct classes of evidence to be found in Scripture--In treating of which I shall begin with that which throws the strongest light on the subject; and conclude by endeavoring to analize the pretended foundation of the Universalists' creed.

The first proofs I shall adduce treat more particularly of the punishment of the wicked after Judgment, which we all know takes place after death, which I have shown in a former letter.

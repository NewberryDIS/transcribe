Sem., 81 Ashland Boul. Room 223\nJan. 13th 1891\nDear Mr. Root and Annie & Francis & every one else -- I am so sorry not to have seen Mr. Root. I was out to Oak Park. Spent the Sunday with the Lowes' -- Pauline & Frank Lowe's Father & Mother. I got home Monday a.m. at 8-15, found Mr. Root's card & went at once to the Palmer House but could not find you there. I had a vocal lesson at 9 after that I came home & found LeGrand Smith & heard about your being here nearly all day Sunday -- It made me hot.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101238,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101238","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/3951ab135c145782d4a37d812db09b04.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/3951ab135c145782d4a37d812db09b04.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/3951ab135c145782d4a37d812db09b04.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3951ab135c145782d4a37d812db09b04.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-20T20:06:13+00:00","modified":"2020-05-28T01:13:32+00:00","filename":"3951ab135c145782d4a37d812db09b04.jpg","authentication":"9c21d9ace7109ff5499526973d0333c3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_139_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1004259,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2341,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.039721035644786},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180723"],"TimeCreated":["051103"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180723"],"TimeCreated":["051103"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180723"],"TimeCreated":["051103"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3951ab135c145782d4a37d812db09b04.jpg","FileDateTime":1587413154,"FileSize":1004259,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2341\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2341,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:24 13:52:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:23 05:11:03","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:23 05:11:03","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2559,"ExifImageLength":3934,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1271,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1271","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I went to dinner at about 11.30 then went down to Palmer House & hunted for your names again this time I discovered that there are two Hotel register books there & I had not looked at the right one before - I found your names but the clerk said you had paid your bill & gone - I was glad to here that you had paid your bill but I didn't know where to look for you there.

Aunt Mallie helped me yesterday in my decision though I had found out before that stairs and woman's back were not made to go together. Anna's back is her week spot and the more I have thought about it, the more I am afreaid to have her take those rooms.  On many accounts I think it would be very pleasant for you both but in the end I do not believe it will be economy. I wish me more able to start you in a little home of your own fir I do not believe in renting or boarding, but can you not do as John Leadingham thinks of doing - buy a house on time. Furnish only a couple of rooms and take your dinners out till Anna gets use to things.

I am glad you enjoy riding about that beautiful country. If you rode to Martinsville did you call upon or enquire after the Whipples who formerly lived in our yard. The old Mother is dead, but the boys I think both live there, and I have heard good reports of them. You ought to go over to see Uncle George and his folks. Marion we here from occasionally.

I thought it was considerable when I was there. They had a very nice time and have often remarked since that they wished they were at Oberlin. They told me as soon as they came that Anna asked then to come again. That Mr. Root was not there so did not ask them.  It was quite funny to hear them.  P.H. Boyerton is our next Mayor. I knew I had more excuse for coming home Tuesday noon that I told you. Nette had a part in the young Ladies' Mission circle \"Seven times two\".  I was all alone Tues. eve. till nine o'clock.  I knew I must be at home that evening and could not remember the principal reason.  I had a good restful time as I always do at your home.

She is weak in character and it troubles me to turn out into the cold world, but I fear my strength is not sufficient.  and I know I lack grace. Tomorrow, we are to have a niece of Uncle Eliab's man. She just came from Germany last week. She is supposed to be strong and bright but can not talk English. We went to the Lake yesterday in the band wagon, Ralph Fay, Marguerite and Mr E.R.

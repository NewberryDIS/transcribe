I wrote to Josiah yesterday stating that if the commissioner did not want to transfer Mr Blake to another agency that I would accept a clerkship of another Post. I am of the opinion that the clerks in the Med.? office have made up their minds to sacrifice us in the field in order to save their own heads. I will not repeat what I wrote in Rogers letter as he will show the same to you. I have backing enough to hold this position for a lifetime under a republican administrator, but if I hold on now it must be through Democratic influence. Do you know any influential Democrat who would suggest by letter or in person to the Commission that I be retained. I wrote to Josiah in regard to my claims for consideration viz. that during a long term of service (since Dec 12\/78) I have worked faithfully for the best interests of the service, that I have never for a day favored myself in the slightest degree. Others have rested the Agmt? and Physician minor employees have frequently taken leaves of absence.

I'd suggest that you do not emulate either the first or the last in their well known characteristics. You've rarely been hungry for anything I believe though poorly? and you cannot realize the bitterness of being by the unhappy conditions compelled to hunger for everything which this world contains worth having. I have tho? and know what it is, and as dearly as I love you all, I would rather hear that you were each and all quietly resting in the little village cemetery, than to hear of your entering on the experiences I've been? through and which has left its imprint so deeply that a hundred years will not wash out the stain. Let go now and show your good sense. Please send me the paper mentioned and also the assignment from you (as administrator) to me. Also send me copies of notes you have paid.\nIn great haste\naffectionately\nC\nRegister the packages.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":68529,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/68529","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/bd0d7aeb5915bdee88194c45beefa0cc.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/bd0d7aeb5915bdee88194c45beefa0cc.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/bd0d7aeb5915bdee88194c45beefa0cc.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/bd0d7aeb5915bdee88194c45beefa0cc.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T15:18:42+00:00","modified":"2020-03-18T00:46:04+00:00","filename":"bd0d7aeb5915bdee88194c45beefa0cc.jpg","authentication":"69ffcd237342548d394a69a85480eb20","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":40,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3014_FL010_00001_o2.jpg","size":1267696,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2837,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0413744304755939984463708469775156117975711822509765625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120605"],"TimeCreated":["075752+0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120605"],"TimeCreated":["075752+0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20120605"],"TimeCreated":["075752+0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"bd0d7aeb5915bdee88194c45beefa0cc.jpg","FileDateTime":1522336677,"FileSize":1267696,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2837\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2837,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:07:03 13:53:00","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":182},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:05 07:57:52","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:05 07:57:52","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":83,"SubSecTimeOriginal":83,"SubSecTimeDigitized":83,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2370,"ExifImageLength":3007,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.71670190270015154965221881866455078125,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.90476190480012519401498138904571533203125,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1027,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1027","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"United States Indian Service\nCrow Agency\nMonday, Jan 18th, 1884\nDear Roger\nYour of the 9th just at hand.

I believe from Ogden to C.A. is a three days journey two days by R.R. and about one day by stage to Helena over Utah N. R.R. to Custer Station by N. P. R.R. and to Aprez? by stage a from 7 AM until 4 PM stage time? from Custer Station to the Agency. We will be very glad to see you but you must make up your mind to take frontier fare. We can give you a comfortable bed and I wish to God I could say so much for the board. You know that any luxury here is worth about its weight in silver, and our salamis? won't stand the unclear. If you go east over the N. P. R. R. I will ride with you to Custer Station from Helena almost 350 miles. You can ride to the agency in less than a day and can return the next day if you have the curiosity to see how we exist My wife will be delighted to see you and I should be very glad to have you see her. She would accompany me to Helena with pleasure but her health would not admit of such a hurried trip. And in a month she is going unclear","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":68547,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/68547","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c81110dc5dce9ee9ebd1dd564b3c1039.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c81110dc5dce9ee9ebd1dd564b3c1039.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c81110dc5dce9ee9ebd1dd564b3c1039.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c81110dc5dce9ee9ebd1dd564b3c1039.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T15:19:03+00:00","modified":"2020-03-18T12:16:34+00:00","filename":"c81110dc5dce9ee9ebd1dd564b3c1039.jpg","authentication":"dae1b26fb9843557eb66a4f6c0aaa78f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":57,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3014_FL016_00001_o2.jpg","size":1230480,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2861,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.039822905743912000164907993848828482441604137420654296875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120605"],"TimeCreated":["081347+0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120605"],"TimeCreated":["081347+0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20120605"],"TimeCreated":["081347+0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c81110dc5dce9ee9ebd1dd564b3c1039.jpg","FileDateTime":1522336678,"FileSize":1230480,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2861\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2861,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:07:03 14:33:32","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":182},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:05 08:13:47","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:05 08:13:47","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":83,"SubSecTimeOriginal":83,"SubSecTimeDigitized":83,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2381,"ExifImageLength":2996,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.71670190270015154965221881866455078125,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.90476190480012519401498138904571533203125,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1027,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1027","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"United States Indian Service\nCrow Agency\nMont Ty, June 15th 1886.\nDear Rogers\nThe report of the sun rise gun from Ft Custer has just been heard.

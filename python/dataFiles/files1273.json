Christmas P. M.\nI did not keep School to day partly on acct of its being Christmas a few families were opposed to its keeping & I shall not probably have to make up the time. I have been to the Dedication of the new Unitarian Meetinghouse at Lechmere Point and have heard a discourse delivered by Rev. Dr. Lowell of Boston very much more to my mind than Dr. Channing's N. Y. Sermon.  It was I believe sincerely intended to conciliate and not alienate. Text \"And the Disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.\"  He spoke as decidedly as could well be expressed in favor of Missions foreign & domestic.  The expression is too cold to say I have no objection to them but with the greatest emphasis he sd.? I do admire [[underlined twice] the man who from proper motives would go to proclaim the Gospel to the heathen.  He sd however that he was pained to hear of Calvinistic Missions & Arminian Missions &c.  On my return from the Dedication a sleigh very fully loaded with Passengers passed us.  After they had got some distance from us Esq. Whipple happened to see me & next? called to me & said there was a letter for me.  I turned my course & came by Col. Metcalfs where I found yours of the 22.  Getting it just as I did enables me to answer it this afternoon & I hope to see Gen G. this evening & send this & some dirty clothes by him -- but tis uncertain.  I shan't need to have you send any more clothes to me.  I am glad I have begun upon the last half of my time.  Is? this being glad time passes so swiftly.  After writing my last which you will probably receive on thursday I found I found I had not answered yours by Mr. Peirce but I learn by yours to day that A]meida has learnt to Braid Palm leaf & I should think it well if she has not paid too dear for her skill.  I can't get much information about the price of them. Mr. Cutler says he bought one for his father 2 yrs. ago for Dollar.  Thinks they are cheaper now.  It seems there is about 3 no's I believe of the Mis. Herald which you have not found. I have not got any bound yet & shall wait a little longer. The applesauce &c. has arrived. Col. M. asked me to take tea with him the other day so he? we have got some very good applesauce -- It was however before he had tasted of it -- they had just opened it.  I hope to send you the black linen thread by Gen. G.  You had better give me some more instructions before I get the other things.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101566,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101566","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/cebc0d578982dc45b85f9a772d373edf.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/cebc0d578982dc45b85f9a772d373edf.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/cebc0d578982dc45b85f9a772d373edf.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cebc0d578982dc45b85f9a772d373edf.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:54:22+00:00","modified":"2020-07-27T01:28:07+00:00","filename":"cebc0d578982dc45b85f9a772d373edf.jpg","authentication":"cd4a730ed11fc95a70f8db77cc46b635","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_148_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1753350,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3075,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.052795844625113},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035507"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035507"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035507"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cebc0d578982dc45b85f9a772d373edf.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920053,"FileSize":1753350,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3075\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3075,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:41:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 03:55:07","DateTimeDigiti÷zed":"2018:07:24 03:55:07","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3108,"ExifImageLength":3638,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I expect Gen G. will take some tracts for Charles if he wants them if not I will keep them.

I wrote to him at Westfield as you will see by this request, but I think it extremely doubtful if he gets it at all there, even if he should go to Westfield at all.  Most likely he will be back at Bangor before this letter will reach Westfield. I think I have written to you pretty abundantly since I have heard from you at all.  In fact if Eliab is there when you get this letter you may consider it as written to him especially, and expect to write to me some yourself; as with my pressure of business, and lack of conveniences, it can hardly devolve upon me to do all the writing.  Just consider my case:  The country is almost barbarous.  The houses generally poorer than every thing you ever saw:  Even Wealthy Menlast two words underlined  {that is men owning their hundreds of acres of Corn & Wheat, and heads of Cattle, horses, & hogs, almost literally unnumbered, will live here in one room log houses, really poorer than a decent man would keep his hogs in at the East.  The only lights at night is a burning rag in a dish of hog fat, perhaps! and every other thing in the same proportion.  To be sure we intend to carry a supply of indispensiblesunderlined with us.  My usual writing apparatus is a little desk or box, on my knees and I usually select the log barn, {probably would be called at the East a penunderlined rather than even a barnunderlined; a real Yankee barn for a stopping place would be a luxury indeed { or get under our big baggage wagon to write.  Then again the matter of timeunderlined for writing is a material matter.  We intend to work in the field as much of the time as men can work;  then all the rest of the time is just about enough to do up the necessary writing & calculations.  The men usually drop down & sleep in bed or floor, generally with their clothes on.  They enjoy themselves and are extra healthy in this way.  After finishing my writing, I bathe thoroughly, and sleep usually in the Wagon or perhaps barn floor, or open Porch on a straw bed & fixings which I keep in the wagon for my especial benefit.  In the matter of food we are especially lucky  You see the food of \"Suckers\"underlined consists regularly of three things.  Corn bread, smoked hog, and strong Coffee.

If you stay there till Mother and I come home you must let things go - no matter if everything is not so very nice.  We shall have a real overhauling of every thing before we  move, and Mother and I will be there to help.   How long did you stop in Bangor?  I want to know whether you are going there to stay.  I went to Mr. Parker's visiting yesterday afternoon and stopped to Bible Class in the evening - the first time I have been out an evening since last fall, except just across the yard into the Academy.  I am reading well now in french; the rest of them say that I pronounce best of the class.  I am in the 4th or 5th French class!  I hardly know which!  Write soon and long about every thing.

Ecles?, Susan Carpenter and many others I have heard say \"they wished they could get Miss Rich again, but it was a very hard school and low wages, and they certainly could not blame her if she should be unwilling to come.\"  All with one accord say their children never learned so much in any three Sumers before &c. &c.

I believe it is expected of me that I should write about two letters to any of my brothers or sisters one to me. You especially, I must say, appear to be remarkably remiss in this matter.  Now I really think you ought to write me a regular sisterly letter about once in a month.  It is you know quite a difficult matter for a young man to properly 'take heed to his steps?', especially if he be a College Student, smudged College Students are generally supposed to be.  Now how much good it must do such an one to have Sisters watching and writing to him, taking care of him & c.  Why, I sometimes think I can tell by a Students' conduct and appearance whether he has Sisters to write to him occasionally.

Nov. 5th. 1848\nDear Sister Anne\nYour letter dated at Buffalo, N.Y., I received in due season some time ago, - one Saturday. I then intended to write to you again immediately, and direct to Racine so that my letter might be the first one to reach you on your arrival at your new home. You see I did not do as I intended; and the circumstances of which I have been, form perhaps my best excuse for the delay. The night I received your letter I had just come from Springfield. By the way, you are yet to learn how near I came to being in Alabama instead of Old Massachusetts. There is a great Railroad to be built from Mobile to the Mouth of the Ohio River. Capt John Childe of Springfield Mass. is appointed Chief Engineer - to begin the surveys of location immediately; He was desirous of taking out with him a large party of Assistants from here. He sent up an express to J.L. Leonard, a co worker of mine on the Vt. & Mass., and a former pupil of Capt. C's, to see him at Springfield the next morning, and offering him a situation. The opening appeared to me a very favorable one - the longest projected Rail Road in the Country - good salaries & permanent employment for five or six years at least.  I could be well recommended to Capt. Childe, and as I expected then to be through here in a month or two, I thought it best to go down and see. I found however the numbers all made up at once; though the Capt Childe appeared to like my appearance, and held out the prospect of a favorable situation there sometime in the future. So I did not go to Alabama, and returned to Vt & Mass.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101584,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101584","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/41381ae7af543877315e29cca5d650f5.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/41381ae7af543877315e29cca5d650f5.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/41381ae7af543877315e29cca5d650f5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/41381ae7af543877315e29cca5d650f5.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:54:47+00:00","modified":"2020-07-27T01:28:08+00:00","filename":"41381ae7af543877315e29cca5d650f5.jpg","authentication":"48f61b2a3a6eda62f5b3fab9bb2c6d4b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_150_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1827491,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2862,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.059123735020835},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035742"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035742"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035742"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"41381ae7af543877315e29cca5d650f5.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920054,"FileSize":1827491,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2862\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2862,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:42:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 03:57:42","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 03:57:42","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3005,"ExifImageLength":3779,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"But Leonard did conclude to go off to Alabama, and to start in three or four days only!

As for spending the Sabbath there I could not think of it, & come up to Northfield  From \"Grouts'\" diverges a Branch Rail Road to Greenfield, just begun building. I am employed considerable of the time on that. The Main Road will soon be complete: & I should have left: but coming here on the Branch, they will want me to stay all winter, perhaps longer. For advancement in Engineering I do not know as circumstances could favor me any more than they have & do.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":101586,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/101586","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/541f92e46a2f77acee3cb52cea5f3c8b.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/541f92e46a2f77acee3cb52cea5f3c8b.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/541f92e46a2f77acee3cb52cea5f3c8b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/541f92e46a2f77acee3cb52cea5f3c8b.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-26T16:54:50+00:00","modified":"2020-07-27T01:28:08+00:00","filename":"541f92e46a2f77acee3cb52cea5f3c8b.jpg","authentication":"d7fedf5370ea52b4e82eb55e9a6e59ba","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_006_fl_150_001_004_o2.jpg","size":1827913,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2871,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058952004076525},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035749"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035749"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180724"],"TimeCreated":["035749"],"City":["yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["What is the Midwest"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 6 "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"541f92e46a2f77acee3cb52cea5f3c8b.jpg","FileDateTime":1587920054,"FileSize":1827913,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2871\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2871,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:25 16:42:35","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:24 03:57:49","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:24 03:57:49","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":31,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3020,"ExifImageLength":3786,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1273,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1273","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"There - I have fairly filled three pages with 'Self.'

April 28th 1849\nDear Sister Anne \n\n Your letter of March 20th has but just come to hand yesterday or the day before. It seems to have had rather a long passage: somewhat lengthened to be sure by difficulty of finding my whereabouts. My letters have been round strangely for a month or two past. The Vermont & Mass R.R. you know is completed to Brattleboro. After much delay until I got most out of patience, though I ought not to complain as my wages went steadily on. I got fairly away from Vt. & Mass. March 19th, and at Boston, on my way Down East, entirely out of business and perhaps with little prospect of any immediately in these dull \"Money Crisis\" times for Rail Roads. The next day, R.R. traveling being cheap for Engineers, I found myself at the N.H. City of Manchester, thinking to call upon a friend of mine at Epping N.H. on my way to Portland. Being at Manchester, I called, though with scarcely a thought of Employment, upon the Chief Engineer of the N.H. Central R.R. a new Rail Road just beginning from Manchester N.H. to Winsor Vt. The N.H.C. happened to be just then in want of Engineers, I happened to be recommended from the Vt. & Mass. as perhaps few are recommended, and was snapped up shortly. I was really disappointed instead of Bangor as I expected, the same week I left Vt. & Mass R.R. found me regularly situated on the N.H. Central. A situation too such as all young Engineers do not get. I have Engineer in Charge, Sec. Div. N.H. R.R.  12 miles long is the Div. in Towns of Goffstown and Weare. Hillsboro' Co. N.H. Salary $720.00 per Annum. As the Road is to be a long one & only part of it commenced upon I may perhaps have employment here if I choose for two or three years. At any rate the situation is better than building Plank Roads in Wisconsin; better for me as an Engineer, even if I could get $1000.00 or even $1500.00 per year there.

Rough, rugged New England, where they build Rail Roads that are Rail Roads, and with money too, is the school for Engineers. It will be some time before they will go to Wisconsin for Engineers, and an Engineer I bid fair to be.  All the letters I have from Bangor & Milo are complaining bitterly of you for not writing. Mother worried all wonder. Lucy makes a merit? of consolation that if you were dead or very sick, somebody else would have written. The Last Advices is that Eliab saw a letter of yours to Miss Lizzie Doe. Now I think of it, perhaps my letter may be the bearer of the news to you, Charles has another Boy. It was born on Eliab's Birthday. Will they not name it after him? I am most afraid though that they will get \"Kittredge\" or \"Russel\" or some such horrible thing in with the Eliab.   I suppose they have written to you about Joseph's condition. I do not know as anything has ever so much saddened me. He thinks it is permanent, irremediable; says he is ? no more to be an action & mover in the world. It seems dreadful for one to be stopped so short, in the midst of days, one too like him, with such prospects of wealth, usefulness, and I think greatness, There are few young men like our Joseph. Others may judge as they please. Very few of my age, not a great many of any age, have a more extended acquaintance with young men than I have, and I certainly do not know a mind his equal. I am certainly successful in my undertakings. I am considered \"promising\", but with all my superior advantages, I can but feel that Joseph is my Superior. Taking such a man away from active life is a loss to Community. He has sold out his business to Thurston. The Doctors  after Bleeding, Blistering, & Strychnia till they were tired prescribe rest, total rest, & the Summer, he has quartered himself at Milo.

Humphrey is at Grouts helping Joseph A. Since I came here my Vt. & Mass Superior, A.R. Field Esq., then out of business, who was much pleased with me, has taken charge of a new Rail Road, the Ashuelot R.R. from Winchester to Keene to be continued both ways to Concord & to Northfield to connect with Vt. & Mass  He was very much disappointed that I could not go on there with him wanted to make me his Second, and so as an inducement even offered to increase my regular salary from his own pocket.  We had quite a fire here nearby Sat. Morning 28th. The most dreadful one I ever saw. A large stable was burned up with eight horses, four oxen & a cow. Some very valuable horses, the whole 13 animals valued at over $1200.00  It was a bad sight to see the ruins, & the remains of the animals in the morning. The place, one mile from here, called \"Oil Mill Village\" in town of Weare, seems to be doomed, almost Last Fall a fire broke out there, consumed the Tavern, two stores, Grist Mill, Saw Mills, Rail Factory, Peg Factory, Machine Shop, Turning Lathe, Large Stables &c  In all fifteen or twenty buildings, all the business part of the Village, throwing dozens of men out of employ. No attempt has been made to build up. business stopped entirely. Now this fire & every horse owned in the Village! It does seem to be judgments of God plainly. It has always been the most perfectly irreligious place anywhere. No meeting, & positively no one living even going to meeting anywhere hardly for years! Two or three wealthy men who own all the property, acquired it by Distilling & Rum Selling! It is the most convenient Post Office for me, as I usually pass through there every day: My? letters have come there considerably; but lately not liking the looks of the direction, I prefer to have my letters directed to the other Village, where I attend Church, and where I hope you will direct a letter to me immediately upon the receipt of this. The Direction is Goffstown N.H.     April has been very cold here & the March prospect of an early spring rather disappointed..  Permit me to suggest that you do not go upon the right plan in your correspondence You are now so far distant and letters are so long in the transit, make it a rule to answer a letter immediately, upon the receipt, within twenty four hours. really easier if you only get in the habit of it.

Sept. 16, 1849\n\nDear Sister Anne\n  Your letter of the twenty third ultimo was rather long in reaching me on on account of my present scattering condition. Being engaged on a Survey, and moving from place to place, my letters are directed all along the Line, and reach me just as it happens, sometimes by Stage Drivers, and some time not until some one is coming expressly to me. Your letters probably reached Goffstown ten days since, waited there about a week: and then reached me so full of business that I could hardly stop long enoug to read it until Sunday  You know that I did make the rule to answer your letter the next day after their receipt, but I could not this time.   You mention my visit home.  It was almost an  aggravation. You see I had got my business all arranged so I could be gone I thought some two or three weeks, and I would have a grand visit home and everything go on just as good in my absence &c.   Well I got started, got down to Manchester and there found our President of Board of Directors, N.H.C.R.R. wanting to see me on special business! Somewhat vexations to be sure, but rather flattering withal for so young an Engineer to be selected over the heads of other & older ones whose business it most appropriately was, to make a very important and very difficult Survey. Mr Price said they wanted someone there in whom they had full confidence, so that the same Engineer who made the survey could remain on the work in building. Rather flattering, wasn't it? besides implying the promise of an excellent situation for two or three years, for the Line is over a very difficult country, which will take a long time to build, and be exactly the [[vry?\u00a0??} school for a young

March 9 1851. AD.\nDear Sister Anne,\nA letter from you was received here by the last mail. Lucy maintains that she has written one letter to you that you had not received at the time you wrote. I do not know as I have anything to write but I can make a beginning.  It is Sabbath day, Mr Partridge has gone to be married, and there is no meeting today. Mother and I were going to Brownville to Church but the morning was a regular March Snowstorm; latterly the Sun has come out brilliantly and we talked of starting this afternoon but Mother says it is too late. So I am writing, Lucy is \"Lounging\", and Mother is looking at her Plants.\nDid they write to you how I made a trip in the woods with Samuel? We were gone to or three weeks, and went the rounds with a varied experience of Mountains, Ribers, Lakes, Woods, Camp, and all the et cetera of a Lumberman's life.\nI enjoyed the trip very much on the whole. I could enjoy life very well there, except the Sabbaths which are hard.\nSince then I have been helping Charles get up wood. We have got up more than a year's stock of good hard wood; more I  guess than he has often or perhaps ever had at the door at one time before. \n10th Mother & Lucy are commanding me to write more, but I do not know as there is any more to write. Lucy has said all the good things and more too. She plays Back Gammon excessively, and got well slowly\nMy name is Isaac\nWritten upside down at the top (but not all legible as the paper is ripped):\nam very glad you are so comfortably situated I would try to commence - ripped - by all

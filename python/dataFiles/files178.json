Gen. Taylor is expected here tomorrow & they are preparing for a great and grand display. It will soon be over & I can not leave soon for my mind is more particularly engaged in my California Expedition, which I have told you about before. I have not rec'd any answer to my last letter. But Chandler this letter you must be sure to make notice of & do not disappoint me, do not Chandler for I am in earnest & you are now duty bound to give me attention. I shall go to California next month if I am alive. I have made arrangements to go overland via Independence, thru south pass & is a safe & good route. I found a company in Baltimore but as I did not hear from you I came here & have now Joined a company about 30 or from 30 to 50 fine respectable young men who are going to join together, put in a sum to defray expenses, provide every thing necessary for comfort such as wagons, working materials of every description necessary to make the expedition profitable & successful. We are to work as a company called the Washington City & California mining expedition. We are each to pay in $175 dollars before the 10th of March & I want you to Send me $300 so that I can complete my\n\n[left-hand side] $300 is the sum. Chandler I think you had better get a draft is good here on Greenfield Bank & send it by letter. You can arrange it right before a witness charge it to me & I will endorse the amount on your note. I hope you will do me this favor for I think my fortune depends upon it. I cannot return home to get it and whatever steps you think will decide it. The company is nearly made up and you must be as quick as possible. I am quite well. I was never better. I think it safe for me to go & I shall often inform you of my success. The president of the co is a learned & scientific man and he understands all things necessary to be successful in obtaining Gold. We provide everything for comfort in case of sickness & are bound to take good care of each other at all times. Mother must not oppose it. I am now in full prime and able to meet the task. Besides a great many very nice young men are going. Write immediately and comply with my request & in due time if God be pleased to pass miracles I will return to my own and my friends satisfaction. I am anxious to go & I shall be careful, judicious, prudent. So now I must bid you good bye. I will write you and tell you all about my visit in Washington. I cannot bear to live stuck in one place in such a fine country as this it is my delight to travel & it agrees with my health.  You are doing well at home and I look forward to the time not far distant when I shall be well situated in life. Do not think that I have to come home or anything else.

Within the last few months, indeed for the last year I have been dissatisfied with my progress & felt that I was never interested to be drudging the life of a servant for little or nothing. My mind looks higher. I feel more spiritual as I grow older & aspired to go ahead in this path I am to tread. I hope I cause no tears to flow, no sighs to heave your friendly bosoms.

I cannot bear to drag through life poor & dependent. I have been thrown out of employment & have found nothing fit to engage in at least to be profitable & cannot work for nothing. I could not do a profitable business with my present capitol & will not work for low wages when I believe I can better myself to making some greater expectations & besides I believe that my life is a peculiar one of a roving nature & even could I afford it I would go to California on purpose to travel, but since inducements are good I am bound to go - this is certain. You cannot disappoint me. I am now 25. I can endure hardship now if ever, & by the time I am 27 or less time I can settle near you, be happier & more useful by making exertions now. I am not obliged to stay any longer than I choose. I do not wish to be away from your all, but neither be able to live near you. I have been in this town working hard. I may as well be absent in California a year, as in Boston & I will not return till I have accomplished my object.  Do not think me wild & foolish, tis my own case. have considered it well & shall go, do my best & return as soon as possible. You can enclose $300 in a letter direct to me at Washington. I could make good use of more but can do with that, there is no risk in sending it; for money is sent all over the country & I do not wish to carry the note with me. I want you to send this as soon as you get this letter for the time is soon coming  for us to go. Yours truly Charles\n[left-hand side] If you have written & directed it to Baltimore I shall get your letter but you have not written for I should have received it. I am quite well and hearty.\nEmily must of course know (when she said I must not take a cent of the property to travel, which my Father worked so hard for) that I also worked very hard at home till I was 20 years old nearly when I might elsewhere have earned more than my board & got a good trade besides, but however Emily is a good sister. I hope yet to get through the world by my own efforts.\nSaturday, Chandler Gen. Taylor arrived here last evening. I had the pleasure of seeing him & hearing. I tell you he is a very fine noble looking man, he looks like a fair, intellectual, and pleasant. Every body is pleased with him, He receives company today. Chandler if you have written to me already & directed it to Baltimore I shall get it for the letters are advertised and besides think I shall go there before I go on my Journey. When you get this letter, do not feel otherwise than I am perfectly sane & do not unless you think it unsafe to trust my honesty hesitate to comply with my request immediately. I have inquired further into the minutes of the company & believe it to be the best opportunity yet offered to go to California. I shall try the same thing & keep along till I go but I cannot think of going back to Boston or to Warwick till I have tried my fortune in a land tho yet wild, I believe & our first men believe is rich in Gold mines. Our President has been employed by the government, is well acquainted with mineralogy & all are hearty & steady men. It is perhaps designed for me to meet this opportunity & I am willing & anxious to try my luck, even if there is no gold. I can do better than to stay here.

Some of my last letters were written horribly bad, for I had not a decent pen.\nI hope my California letters have not occasioned any one of You unnecessary uneasiness. I have been, & am Still Sincere & am waiting the arrival of the wherewith to complete my arrangements. For myself I lot upon the expedition. I have made out a complete list of the little necessities for convenience & comfort to take with me. We are not going to start unmindful of what we are to contend with consequently have thoroughly investigated the matter & Shall provide ourselves amply with all the requisites for the Journey. The flakes of gold are not so close to our eyes as to hide the great object in view & to exclude from our vision the privations which naturally must follow Such an enterprise.\n\n[left-hand side] I rec'd Chandler's letter dated the18th mailed at Athol & the x which he enclosed. It came in a good time. I left word at Baltimore to send letters that come I rec'd it last Sunday. I hope I can sometime return a like favor.\nI know many who go out to Cal. on shares that is men furnish them with capitol and receive half the proceeds. Now I want to find my own capitol & get whole instead of half, stay about a year & come home, settle down somewhere near home or in Boston, & do much better than to go now & to drag on from year to year on a little.\nI write this letter to let you know I have received your letter & the money. So you may not think it lost, I am greatly obliged. I am looking for that 300 now every day. I hope you are not going to disappoint me. Now do not let my movement surprise you, all will come sound right bye & bye.\nI think if nothing happens I shall come home in about a year at any rate if I am successful & work. We shall go to Independence about the 25th from here by cars & steamboats and from there join and go by waggons & etc. We shall get to California about the last of July or first of August & have 4 months to work before the rainy season comes on. I hope Chandler has sent me the money & when it comes, I will write back & tell you  & you must visit soon.

Your letter in which was enclosed a draft of three hundred dollars payable to my order; come to hand Sat. the 24th. I found no difficulty in collecting the money on the same. So Chandler all is safe. I was highly gratified to see that you was willing to oblige and assist me. I had confidence in you & felt Sure it would come, yet I did not like to call upon you & planed every way but could not make it go to my mind and as the last resort asked this favor of you knowing at the same time that it would surprise you and perhaps offend. But O I hope not. I hope I shall hear you say sometime that you was glad you acquiesced with my wishes- And at least I hope you will not experience any inconvenience from it. I thank you very much for I have set my mind on this adventure, believing it to be worthy my time and attention and should have been grievously disappointed had I not succeeded in carrying out my plans. When I engage in anything, I like to carry it out. I am quite well, am in good Spirits & hope to be prospered on my Journey. I conformed to the rules of the constitution, Sat night by paying in my proportion & signing the constitution. I was Just in the nick of time, for now no more can be\n[left-hand side] I want you all to feel perfectly reconciled- the same as though I was in Boston- and not think that we are never to meet. There is no occasion for such fears. We cannot shape our own course be we where we may, & I feel perfectly resigned to whatever God may design. I love & fear God & in him I am willing to trust and go with as little reluctance to California as I would to go to Boston. We must try and not endanger our lives and pray to be preserved from danger.\nI went to Mt. Vernon last Friday & had a good long walk. But I got paid for going. I started from here about 9 o'clock walked all the way there & back & roamed all over the farm. While there my Journey I suppose was not less than 40 miles that day & found myself bright and well the next morning. It was about 16 miles from here & I walked as much as 6 or 8 miles besides. Well it was awful muddy some of the way but I put it through & it made me feel same as I used to when I had to work. I have got a lemon & some leaves from the tree which Washington set out- no mistake. I saw Washington's tomb. It has been, & may be again a most beautiful place but it looks rather neglected about the fences and out buildings.  Still it is a beautiful place & I wish you could go. It was a very warm day--like summer--not a cloud--all was still & it seemed rather melancholy as I stood at Washington's tomb. I hope the Government will fix up this old place & I know of no prettier place in the world if it is improved & made what it might be.__\nI have been in Georgetown & Alexandria but these places seem dull and not much going on. I shall write in a day or two again & tell you how we get along. We are all getting ready with a great deal of care. We are cheerful and we shall I hope all be true friends. I have not been unmindful of my friends but I can go ahead I think and not feel faint in the least, but I am sorry you feel so bad about my going. But, after all, to know that you all care for me is a great satisfaction and knowing this, I shall feel much better on my way. I shall not dream of tears, I hope, but smiles & I shall as soon as I can turn my face homeward to see those I love & who love me.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":41298,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/41298","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/cdea45be91e5a0e3b10fbf14a304119f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/cdea45be91e5a0e3b10fbf14a304119f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/cdea45be91e5a0e3b10fbf14a304119f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cdea45be91e5a0e3b10fbf14a304119f.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T19:04:31+00:00","modified":"2020-04-24T19:15:57+00:00","filename":"cdea45be91e5a0e3b10fbf14a304119f.jpg","authentication":"9b59d82c5f34b5738a692c12f99bca1c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_049_007_002_o2.jpg","size":1886562,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2875,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.06075884057971},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170727"],"TimeCreated":["031916"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170727"],"TimeCreated":["031916"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170727"],"TimeCreated":["031916"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cdea45be91e5a0e3b10fbf14a304119f.jpg","FileDateTime":1509390027,"FileSize":1886562,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2875\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2875,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:27 14:51:14","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:27 03:19:16","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:27 03:19:16","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3281,"ExifImageLength":4108,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":178,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/178","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"taken.

I could not have joined, at first they thot of having 50 but others came in till it got to 60, a votes was passed not to take more. But when I arose on Sat eve and to told them it had been & still was my intention to go and should have been an actual member sometime previous had not unavoidable circumstances, prevented me, that I was ready and willing to fully conform to the terms of the constitution, all hands said I certainly must go & that they thought I was actually one of the party all of the time. So as luck would have it, I succeeded and through my influence 3 others came in so the company is now 64 selected men, all proposed by some second person who was well acquainted with them and then voted for as a member by the whole company who had joined before. They all seemed pleased to have me go - & I think generally they are those in whom I can trust yet I shall be on my guard. It is considered here to be a very fine respectable co. So you see I am bound to go- certainly I think it best. I am quite busy in getting ready. We start a week from today the 2nd of April. We meet all to gather opposite Layfayette Square in the afternoon dressed in our uniform as we call it, which is a suit of rather dark Satinette with gilt buttons on our coats & we put on a cap with the initials of the association which is W.C.C. M. A.   Washington City California Association. We march in a body to the depot, accompanied by a band of music then take the cars for Pittsburg & then go on to independence & St. Joseph by way of Cumberland and the Ohio river.

But I beg of you, Mother, not to give yourself pain and uneasiness. Do not let me hear that you still feel bad & shed tears, but be cheerful & feel that all is to be for the best. I think so. I did not stay away from because I did not wish to see you. Oh no. I dream of you. I think of you daily and it is half my life to know that you are still remembering me tho I am away. I shall not forget you & I hope to be prospered, hope we all shall live and again have a happy meeting. I have no fears to the contrary. We cannot read the future but we ought not to borrow trouble. Now Mother do smile and be cheerful if you do not it may be that your trouble is uncalled for. I shall write to you a long letter and tell you everything. I am quite well. I shall write again if I send home my things. I shall send a few things perhaps and be particular to send them so that they will reach you safe. I know how. And there is no danger of loosing them. I will write to morrow & tell you where to send a letter after I start from here.

for blasting is to be taken I believe 1000 pounds for we intend to give the mountains a try when we get there we have Scientific men who understand mineralogy and there are men of all trades going or at least all principle trades such as carpenters 2 or 3 blacksmiths, and such men we can not do without, and then there are clerks and merchants Young good looking and of good talents.\n\nLate accounts state that with all the rush there is room enough and plenty of gold. Now of course it will be silly to count the chickens now; we hope and intend to do well. I hope we may be prospered. There are a great many going?-there is a hole in paper this spring. We shall get there in July probably and our course will lead directly to the diggins, so of course we shall not go to St. Francisco at first but- be on the ground before we get there. It is stated that gold is found on all the small streams which flow from the mountains in to the Sacramento and we intend to look for the lumps a little among the rocks & also we can wash from the sand & etc.\nNow I am not over anxious, fascinated or nothing of the kind. I think however there is no doubt we shall make it a pleasant excursion and a profitable one too. I shall write as often as I can and after our arrival there is a mail once a month from St. Francisco and we can correspond there with ease. You may depend upon my confidence and attachments. I can leave here with much more fortitude than I could from home when you all would feel so bad that would be a hard parting indeed. Charles\n[left-hand side] Chandler I send you the note, with the three hundred endorsed and I think however I will send a receipt which will have and I will send the note perhaps.another time. I shall write again tomorrow and tell you more about the matters relating to our Journey & when I shall send my things which in fact will be few, for I shall take all I can with me.\nChandler I am afraid you will feel worried about the draft for I ought to have written immediately but I wanted to see how I succeeded with my plans. But all is well & I am getting along finely, I believe. I hope you will have good times this summer, all of you and I hope I shall. I shall often think of you and Samuel. When I get to St. Louis, I shall write and all places as when I can.

We have Just encamped near the banks of the Platte River and not far from a Pawnee village. Today & yesterday we saw many Indians. They came to us & asked for something to eat. They sat down in a row. The Chief in front & we gave them bread & meat for which they seemed very grateful. This morning the Chief came again to our camp with others. We did not let them into our camp but watched them out side.They shook hands & were friendly. I made an indian pudding, which they are very fond of and carried it in fine order to them. I then gave them some cold water. I also gave the Chief a little sugar & some salt to cary home to his Squaw & Papposes. They then shook hands & left. There are many tribes yet to pass. I hope we shall not have occasion to fight any. There are 2 other companies with us and we are pretty strong. I think we shall go along finely. The country is so beautiful I cannot begin to describe it. I shall give this letter to a man who will have it mailed\n[left-hand side]\n\nat St. Joseph. I will write again when I get to Fort Kearny. We shall get there in 3 days probably. I hope you are all well.____\n\nFrom morning till night we have traveled on the level pararie or plain. I can think of nothing but a dry ocean or sea. Only think of the contrast between New England hills and one immense smooth plain all green & rich like a garden. I am in good spirits and quite well. Give my love to all. Good Bye. I hope you are all having a good time\nI am enjoying myself quite well but I don't like to be obliged to travel all the time. There are abundance of grass and wild roses. Pinks & beautiful flowers as fair as any of the gardens in the east- here they are wild & no one to enjoy their beauty. But I must close for the present.   Good bye again.       Chas.

C.\nLong's Bar,  Feather River Mines,  May 22\/50\nDear Sister Abby I can hardly find words to express the gratitude Joy & Satisfaction I felt when I received a letter from home. It arrived here about the 6th of this month, & of course was at Sacramento City 2 or 3 weeks earlier. So our letters happened to go pretty direct. I did not expect an answer to my last so soon, but I expected one from home a long time before it came, but it came at last, & I was happily disappointed to find it an answer to mine written in Decr.  I felt very anxious to hear from home as I had heard nothing Since I was at St. Joseph last year & Just about a year ago. I thought much of that favor I assure you, & happy indeed am I, to acknowledge the receipt of another at this time. The express man will leave here on the 25 & will take all letters entrusted to his care, to San Francisco or Sacramento City, & then this will be mailed for the States. I expect the steamer will leave about the 1st of June & I hope you will get this letter in due time & I hope it will find you all well & you must answer it as soon as possible for it seems a long while to wait till this goes home & back again.

Dec 4th 1853\nDear Br.

I am happily disappointed to hear that not one of our number has been removed by the hand of death. I opened Your letter with delight yet feared I should soon see the announcement of a removal of some one or more of our family by the hand of death. But the news contained in your letter dispels all my fears & doubts & hope tells me I may yet meet my Mother, Brothers & Sisters, again. The thought is delightful- I again am happy in the belief that we may all meet again. Providence has indeed been kind, thus to watch over and preserve our lives & give us health & strength. It is right to attribute our present Joy to the kindness & mercy of our Father in Heaven. I was anxious to hear the true state of matters at W_. As you say, I have been hoping for the best. My thought has ofn been turned heaven ward, beseeching God in the behalf of my mother, Br Sis & Friends. I now, that I am informed, that Heaven has smiled on your pathway, preserved you all, & you are enjoying health & prosperity, -while many around you are numbered with the dead, I can only say, God is indeed merciful, & may we all strive to be more worthy his kindness & protection.\nDear Br, I have been richly paid for writing, for, I rec'd 3 letters, for One - It was very kind in you, to answer my letter so soon, & it gave me great pleasure to see that all my friends felt disposed to contribute a few lines; this evidence of remembrance gives great Satisfaction - At few\n[left-hand side] Chandler You will please remember me to Your wife.

I have purchased a claim  unclear  I wrote, gave quite a price but I think it a bargain yet. I was prevented from walking about 4 weeks by a sore hand since I wrote it was a bruise or felon Template:An infection in the finger tip pad caused by working, & taking cold as soon as it got well.

Dear Mother I wish I could this moment meet you face to face & mingle together tears of joy that we had again met together after travelling on in the journey of life so many years at so great a distance apart. I would gladly take you by the hand, while yet it is warm with life tho' withered by age & toil the benefit of which I have shared & I would fain kiss this night ere I sleep. that careworn cheek & grieve myself to sleep to think my absence had caused one furrow there: I could bend the manly knee be once more a child at your feet, look up in a mothers face & ask her to forgive me for ever causing a tear to flow from a restless eye to moisten a fond parents aged brow. And yet- while your eye is sparkling with life's glimmering light- I would ask for a parting gift, a mother's blessing. Dear mother I beg of you do not allow yourself to mourn or grieve on account of your absent Son. Be cheerful & enjoy the many comforts around you -Your Children, all save one are near you, even that one is near you in thought. Let not my absence clog up & stop the many sources of happiness around you. Bear constantly in mind that Charlie loves his Mother & intends to come home to see his mother smile once more. Chandler & Sam'l are both settled by your side; they will be affectionate & kind. Their wives I think will not fail to contribute to your happiness. The Girls Abby and Mary are Still fond of their old home & like a mothers presence & forsake you not. Danford & Emily & family are now living quite near. On every side & closely too You are surrounded by true friends, are you not? This is the way I have viewed the matter - For your sake especially I regret being absent so long; For as you say life is uncertain. Since I wrote I have bought a Claim which will detain me till another season unless I sell. I think my bargain is a good one.\n[left-hand side] \nI am living 2 1\/2 miles from Downieville this winter, & working my new claim when it is good weather. I go to town Downieville every week\n[written sideways across top] \nSend my letters the same as before to Downieville, Sierra Co. Cal. I have not said much to Emily & family yet in this letter. Intend to write to D & E this week but at any rate Please give my love to Danford, Emily & family & tell them I thank them for their friendly letter E has quite a family.

Give my respects to Uncle David tell him I am very happy to hear he is alive and well-- he is & ever will be remembered with pleasure. I hope to see him again.\nAunt Reed,  Chandler, says, is well. I am delighted to hear it. Please remember me to her also Cousin Anne, if alive, her name is not mentioned I think Where is Cousin John & family--Remember me J Goldsbury & family. I have not forgotten other neighbors but very likely they have me. Give my respects to those you think care to hear of an absent old townsman & friend CR\nMonday Eve Dec 5th   Abby & Mary.   Dear sisters. I return you my sincere thanks for the kind affectionate words contained in your letters; You both write equally sincere--But I think Mary exaggerates when She speaks of spectral image in prospective-There are too many weddings and other lively gatherings to admit of such a probability. Ghosts sup not, with Cupids. They breathe not the same air- so no more ghosts stories Mary I cannot think of any such transformations. Have I then caused so much trouble in our once happy family--I Indeed am sorry to learn such is the case. Well Sisters I ask a thousand pardons. Can you not forgive my silence, for I cannot think myself altogether to blame. I know your humorous hearts will not allow you to retaliate; but forgive & forget, I am indeed sorry I have been instrumental in causing sorrow to steal into the hearts of those I love - let sorrow depart- let your smiles return, dry up thy moistened cheeks & let nought dwell in your young & tender hearts but thoughts buoyant & gay. I feel I have lost much in thus depriving myself of the society & influence of Mother & Sisters. I have hardly spoken to a woman since I left home. Ladies are indeed few and far between; Young Ladies especially; therefore there is no alternative but to associate with my own sex: I think this is a sacrifice. It would be a treat to once more gather together, talk over old times & lifes changing scenes, & as Abby says have a good sing. Well the time may come. I hope so. I Sing some here. I have a violin which I sometimes use, tho' seldom. Sometimes we have quite a good sing. Abby I think you are doing well in teaching, quite persevering. Mary don't tell me what she is about. By the way I think, (speaking of beaux) you may expect a poor gallant in me for I have not walked with, or accompanied any of the fair sex, since I have been in this country. What an awkward beau I must be, of course. I have to take private lessons of Chandler & Sam'l. But enough of this- to be serious I cannot possibly tell when I can best leave to visit you. I need no urging. My business now is such as makes it difficult to leave before another season some time having bought another claim & I think a good one. Believe me ever your Affec. Br C. Reed\nP.S.  if you think it best give my respects to Uncle Wilson & family if they inquire about me\n[left-hand side ]\nI wonder if there will be another wedding in our family near thanksgiving.\nMother I can cook first rate, make bread biscuit & etc.- & wash shirts, sew & mend etc.\n[right-hand side]\nBe sure to write me soon, will you.

Shall I or not say a word to my friends. Yes I will say a word that you may know I am all right. But I must be brief & you will please excuse my short letter. I am well- have been quite well since I wrote last. Am mining at my Old Diggins (Cox's Bar) - doing very fair - not extra, but am not disposed to complain. Yesterday we (5) took out 10 ounces -- this is better than usual - 5 work nights & 5 daytime. We employ 6 Chinamen --good hands to work but hard to understand. The weather is very hot now except morning & Evening - no rain now- all fair weather . It is a busy time here & I suppose it is so with Chandler & Sam'l. I think I could give the boys a tight race mowing. I wish I was there to try it. The 4th of July went of well. We the Sons of T, had a grand turnout--invited all the ladies in the County--had a good Oration Dinner & all the 4th 'doins' necessary to celebrate the day--an anvil for cannon. The dinner was in a grove. There was a grand Ball in the Eve in that I did not join, went to the theater but got tied of that & left, went home & went to bed to dream, of home I expect. Did you have a good time the 4th. I spose you danced, of course, & Mary & Sam'l & Lady or what did you do. The boys are Just coming up from work (the night crowd) & I must eat my breakfast & go at it. One of them says they have got 5 oz.  I guess we shall beat that today. Sometimes we find a crevice 2 or 3 feet long very rich yesterday I worked one - could see the gold as I was digging dirt.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":41386,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/41386","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/ea2a23cc3e4281519863a5096cfb43dd.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/ea2a23cc3e4281519863a5096cfb43dd.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/ea2a23cc3e4281519863a5096cfb43dd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ea2a23cc3e4281519863a5096cfb43dd.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T19:09:05+00:00","modified":"2020-04-28T03:46:40+00:00","filename":"ea2a23cc3e4281519863a5096cfb43dd.jpg","authentication":"28fb8f828bfd87cdd69ef901cb61592a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_052_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1691726,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2880,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05438933899177},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["001248"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["001248"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["001248"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ea2a23cc3e4281519863a5096cfb43dd.jpg","FileDateTime":1509390031,"FileSize":1691726,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2880\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2880,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:01 13:04:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:01 00:12:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:01 00:12:48","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2985,"ExifImageLength":3730,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":178,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/178","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"When we work all day & don't see any that is tough. The fact is, we don't know what our days work will be till we stop work for sometimes it pays well & again, very little but no more about gold; I tell you Abby it takes the hardest kind of labor to get it. I never worked so hard at home but work seems to agree with me especially when I get pay. I don't intend to mine after this year, probably not. You probably think I am not intending to visit home. But I have always been sincere when speaking of coming home. I came very near coming 1st June. I did try to close up & sell out; but after all, I could not arrange it to suit me. I felt sorry but could not help it. I am not getting rich but feel obliged to make the most of the chance I now have.  Once I wanted to get it all but, now, I am not greedy - do not look for a big pile- & shall not try to get it. I intend however to have a little now I am here if I keep my health. So as regards coming home, I would start this morning if I thought I could, & when the time comes round I shall mention it in a letter before I start, so you must not stop writing thinking I am coming home. I expect you think I want to be awful rich, but not so, that is not my luck. Mother may think I don't want to see her--you all may think so but you think wrong if that is the case- You know I want to bring things out right if it does take a good while.

I remember her well: She was a fine girl, a good  page torn  of Mr. Paige, last Winter, or Spring gave me, in his  page torn  some interesting items concerning the coming year & by this time I then expected, to hear Miss Agnes wold be a happy Bride & the Wife of an esteemed friend. Mr. D.

14th Feb has just been received. I m very glad you concluded to say a word or two. You probably have rec'd a letter from me since you wrote this, enclosed in Mary's letter. If so I need not now explain why the letter you wrote last Summer, (referred to in your last), was unanswered. I am sorry it so happened, but it cannot be helped now. I never have rec'd it and got Mary's & Emily's only a short time since Yours may yet come to hand. But I fear not. Do not let that stop you writing. I will try and answer all. I think you was getting rather too  unclear- spunky?  to resolve not to write. I am willing to admit you had some reason to think your letter was treated with indifference by its not being answered, & probably you thought it the result of gross negligence or coldness. I don't think however, Abby you had sufficient reason to harden your heart & resolve to be silent. Have we not always agreed and always loved each other? Have not our letters (less perhaps than might have been) Yet have not our letters spoken affection. Without knowing a cause why should one cultivate fancied enmity. Even, if as you supposed, my heart had been in a cake of ice do you not know Dear Abby that the fond breathings of a true and affectionate sister would soonest communicate warmth & extricate the palsied heart from its dormant state? O Sister Abby do not think I forget you or wish to check correspondence. My principle enjoyment since I saw you (and that is long long ago) has been in thinking of all my\n[left-hand side]\nNow Dear Sister I have written a letter but a poor one- but I want to have you know that. I have no favoritism among my Dear Sisters & when I see you I hope to convince you all is right.\n[across top]\nThis is Br Samuel's Birth day. I think Sister Maria (I believe that's her name) ought to pull Sam'l Ears today. Poor Chandler--he cannot soon be very cheerful. Give my love to all and keep a bushel for yourself. Charles Reed\nI will write to Emily next mail give my love to Danford & family. I don't know but he has resolved, as you did, but we will try and make all right.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":41400,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/41400","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/debc4af7d57e15b11c5c657dad634862.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/debc4af7d57e15b11c5c657dad634862.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/debc4af7d57e15b11c5c657dad634862.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/debc4af7d57e15b11c5c657dad634862.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T19:09:47+00:00","modified":"2020-04-28T22:40:30+00:00","filename":"debc4af7d57e15b11c5c657dad634862.jpg","authentication":"e32d5e68c1776802c46e3edd812b60ce","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_052_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1559599,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2984,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048393872256975},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["001458"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["001458"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["001458"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"debc4af7d57e15b11c5c657dad634862.jpg","FileDateTime":1509390031,"FileSize":1559599,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2984\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2984,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:01 13:04:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:01 00:14:58","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:01 00:14:58","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3104,"ExifImageLength":3744,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":178,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/178","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"friends at home. I have often regretted being away from my sisters & Brothers  and My Dear Mother. Others too have fondly been remembered.\n\n   Whether my letters be few or many, short or protracted, do not think without a visible cause that I am any other than a true & kindhearted brother. I hope the rest of my life be it short or long will be such that you will entertain no doubts.\n   What the future will be I cannot tell. I hardly know myself what I shall do. When I hear from Chandler I may calculate again with more certainty. I have been away from you and all the folks a long time tis true- but this we all expected of course. There was no chance for me to remain very near you and make anything or be contented. Somewhere then must be my home - hence the world at large has been my home - I have acquired perhaps as much fondness for roaming as others under other circumstances have for a permanent home. I have not since leaving Warwick formed any strong local attachment and therefore the fashion of transient homes in Cal has not been tedious or sacrificing to local feelings. I never thought of being so long away from you without making a visit. Circumstances alone have occasioned my long absence. I have always however been fully aware that this climate was better suited for me than any I have ever been in. Yet had I had any success at all I should have early returned. When I had the hardest times & poorest luck I have said the least as you probably already know. I have a heart to endure much & bear my own misfortune or ill luck. But the kind letters have done much to make me at last many way succesful & I shall ever prize your kind letters. I have toiled hard here.  I never worked so hard in Warwick.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":41401,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/41401","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7a6ac63a71a9ef51a56d397015aa82af.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7a6ac63a71a9ef51a56d397015aa82af.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7a6ac63a71a9ef51a56d397015aa82af.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7a6ac63a71a9ef51a56d397015aa82af.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T19:09:50+00:00","modified":"2020-05-19T21:25:43+00:00","filename":"7a6ac63a71a9ef51a56d397015aa82af.jpg","authentication":"889fb43528aaf467aa406f12b857d073","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_03_fl_052_005_003_o2.jpg","size":1545476,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2852,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050175185704639},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["001503"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["001503"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170801"],"TimeCreated":["001503"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7a6ac63a71a9ef51a56d397015aa82af.jpg","FileDateTime":1509390031,"FileSize":1545476,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2852\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2852,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:01 13:04:45","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:01 00:15:03","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:01 00:15:03","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":33,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2976,"ExifImageLength":3756,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":178,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/178","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I have not been very sad or discontented yet much dissatisfied with my succes & having hope, stayed & stayed determined if possible to make enough to have a little home somewhere of my own provided I should live to need one. I first had an intention of going back to boston & go into business if I made a raise here as the saying is but that raise I expected to make in one year or I never should have left for this country with out visiting home- but after getting here & having no success I knew I have to work somewhere & why not be in Cala.\n\n  And so I have studied a long time- yet it is nothing. How many go even a little distance from home & stay years. But others may do as they like it would have suited me to have stepped in and said how de do every day. Of course I should. You all know that I think enough of my old home. It don't seem but a little while since I saw you all after all. and again sometimes it seems an age. You all have got along finely. You have done exceedingly well teaching & so has Mary. You don't get pay enough. You have taught long enough. You ought to rest. I suppose you think I am a curious genius to stay out here so long keeping Old Bachelors hall & I begin to think so myself, but the girls don't bother and head here for there ain't any & so one has to be content with thinking over the names of school gals & etc but fiddlestick every gal I used to know I suppose is saying every day Dear husband Dear this that & tother but I'll stop this nonsense. If I come home I just want to take a good look all round & leave for some other diggins for every thing will be so changed & every body grown & changed that I shall feel lost & wish myself back again.

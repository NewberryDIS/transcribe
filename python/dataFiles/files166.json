Would there were more such homes than there are. The elevated character you give woman, should be the standard of every female. But I regret that too many prize the butterfly joys of Earth more than the purity and excellence of Christian Life!\n    So you have given up teaching and the ministry? I am teaching still and have been since I wrote you, all the time with short vacations only. I thought I should rest this winter, but I couldn't! Why is it that teachers never find a time for rest, or rather rest all the time?\n    Do you like your present employment as well as you did teaching or the ministry? No doubt it will be better for your health. I think even now, you need to take good care of your health lest you become an invalid again.\n    You spoke of visiting New England. If so I hope you will come to Warwick. Perhaps you will be able to preach One Sabbath. Mr. Wilson does not preach here now - he has not since last April. Mr Jackson of Walpole is our pastor now, and a good faithful one he is. People generally, like him very much indeed. He is very sincere and his sermons cannot fail to make an impression upon the attentive mind. Perhaps you will be interested to know that brother Chandler, brother Tyler and sister Emily are to be received into the church tomorrow - New Year's Sabbath.\n    How could you think of Mt Grace this cold weather?

And then such clear cold breezes as it sends down to us - you will smile to know your Warwick friends are 22 degrees below zero!

And will assure you, that it was very welcomely received by the \"Original Abby and Mary.\" So long a time had elapsed since we last heard from you, that I began to think you seriously ill, & unable to write. Then another thought would follow, that you too, had gone to the \"Spirit Land\" to be reunited with those dear friends above. But my fears are not realized! God has preserved your life! And I am happy to hear that you are enjoying a good degree of health again. The business in which you are engaged (though rather hazardous) may be the means of restoring to you, permanent health. I think, had you continued teaching and preaching, together, with the great exertions which you would necessarily make, and which you could not avoid, would have disabled you, perhaps for life.\n    Within a few months, God has seen fit to take back to himself, those near, and dear friends, whom he gave you, but for a very short time; and who are now, pure, bright spirits around their Father's Throne in Heaven. How you will miss the many pleasant associations, which you have enjoyed with her, who was the light and joy of your home? Oh! you will grieve a long, long time. But your faith in God, will enable you to look above for support. I will extend to you my heartfelt sympathy. And I hope you will find friends, who will cheer, and comfort you, while wandering on in the dreary path of life, homeless & alone.\n    Your present occupation, must, evidently, bring you in contact with various classes of society. Yet is my opinion, that the true Christian principles, which have actuated you thus far, will preserve you from the thousand temptations, even if you have not the \"purifying influences of home surrounding you.\" Have I not guessed right? Home should be the seat of happiness; else it ought not to bear the title! For no spirit can long resist bad domestic influences! But it does not depend on woman alone for true piety at home. She can do much with her influence, in making a \"Happy home.\" But she needs aid from others.\n\n(written up left-hand side)\nBrother Samuel was married a year ago last Thanksgiving.

Every home ought, & might, compare well with your description. But how many there are, that fall far, far below! Yet it would be otherwise, I think, could every person understand, (as I think you do), the secrets, by which a home is made happy. Man delights in enterprise and action. And exerts his whole moral force in the conflicts of the world. His feelings are constantly annoyed, by perpetual irritations, and disappointments. And his home should be a place of cheerfulness and comfort in order to sustain him. His soul will then renew its strength, and he will again go forth to encounter the troubles of the world. But he, too, frequently gets the erroneous idea, that woman finds nothing to weary, or perplex her. Therefore it is no effort for her, to greet every one with a cheering word and a happy smile, at all times. But as I think Mr. Kendall, understands human nature exceedingly well. It will not need my arguments to prove it to be otherwise. I guess you have been taking a peep into Eliot's lectures to young men and women, have you not? I have read some of them and like very much. I intend to finish them, when I can find leisure time.\n\n    You inquire if we have been teaching? That has been my chief employment. I have taught in this town altogether.

I have about a dozen young ladies and gentlemen who's ages are from 18 to 21. Some of the young men are very tall, and I am obliged to \"look up\"considerable to get a peep into their faces! After I closed my fall term. Mother, uncle, sister Mary, and myself went to Springfield to spend Thanksgiving with my mother's only sister. We were there a fortnight. I had a delightful visit and came home feeling refreshed, both in body and mind - already to begin my winter's work. But I am getting rather weary again. And I think after finishing my school, sister Mary and myself will visit Boston and Barnstable on the Cape. We shall spend several weeks at my Uncle's, and the nice sea-breezes, will recruit me up very soon. My general health has been very good. Would you like to hear a word from my dear \"Californian Brother\"? He has been doing exceedingly well for a short time past. He had satisfied his golden appetite, and started for home the 29th of Sep. and was shipwrecked the next day, near San Diego. He with the other passengers (consisting of nearly 1000) were taken back to San Francisco. He has since gone back to the mines. It has been some time, now, since we heard from him, and we are feeling rather anxious.\n    You are getting farther, and farther west, I see, every time we hear from you, and should you really reach California, I hope you will look up my brother, and bring him overland to New England back with you, in the spring. Shall I not begin to anticipate this visit? Please remember me kindly to your sister Lydia. Oh! I have just thought of that revolver! I think you are becoming quite brave! May this letter find you well. I should be happy, very, to continue our correspondence.  Good night and a happy Near year. From, Abby.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":38847,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/38847","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/3c48c812f0bd691cf963e15dcfbb2935.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/3c48c812f0bd691cf963e15dcfbb2935.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/3c48c812f0bd691cf963e15dcfbb2935.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3c48c812f0bd691cf963e15dcfbb2935.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-26T16:25:50+00:00","modified":"2020-07-26T21:25:41+00:00","filename":"3c48c812f0bd691cf963e15dcfbb2935.jpg","authentication":"708259aad6ddc93b8932b8b52545c764","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_01_fl_01_002_01_o2.jpg","size":1611753,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2994,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049845153269502},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170706"],"TimeCreated":["231208"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170706"],"TimeCreated":["231208"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170706"],"TimeCreated":["231208"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3c48c812f0bd691cf963e15dcfbb2935.jpg","FileDateTime":1509035115,"FileSize":1611753,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2994\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2994,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"16mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/16.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:07 14:25:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.1,"FNumber":16,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:06 23:12:08","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:06 23:12:08","ShutterSpeedValue":3.321928,"ApertureValue":8,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2585,"ExifImageLength":3108,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":166,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/166","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"(added in pencil later:  Abby to Nathan)\n\n                 Warwick, Feb 17th, 1855\n\nMy Respected Friend,\n\n             \"I'm once again at home.\" And need I tell you, that I am happy? And that I am just as glad to get home again, as when a child? The cares and responsibilities of my school, are thrown aside; and the thought of it is delightful. But let those appreciate my happiness, who have experienced the life of a school-teacher. At times I get weary of school-teaching, and murmur at my lot considerable. Still I like the employment. And after a season of rest at home, I am happy to continue my labor again. I feel that I am doing some good - or at least trying to - and these thoughts inspire me to continue on the work. My school this winter has been pleasant, but rather hard. The examination was last saturday week. Everything passed off pleasantly and satisfactorily, I guess - for they expressed a wish, that I would teach the school next season. The family with whom I boarded live a mile from the schoolhouse, and consequently I was favored with many a nice sleigh-ride. The last two weeks, however, we had no snow, and the road being very rough, I walked generally. This exercise, together with the labors in the school-room were quite fatiguing. But I am going to make an effort, to think, and say, noting more about \"school\" till I commence again.\n    Since you have given me so a pleasant description of your home, my thoughts cannot refrain from lingering there a moment, when they are winging their way to the \"far distant west\" to my brother. I find you not at home always. But just now; your business routine is completed, and the quietness of your home, beckons you in. The warm fire, and that \"once familiar face\" are not here, to welcome your return.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":38850,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/38850","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/557d5f2fb866cce0219b650f25602ae3.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/557d5f2fb866cce0219b650f25602ae3.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/557d5f2fb866cce0219b650f25602ae3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/557d5f2fb866cce0219b650f25602ae3.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-26T16:25:54+00:00","modified":"2020-07-26T21:40:01+00:00","filename":"557d5f2fb866cce0219b650f25602ae3.jpg","authentication":"703167516224ff3f8c1ad55ac8ef39f8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_01_fl_01_002_02_o2.jpg","size":1654456,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3033,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050507870217728},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170706"],"TimeCreated":["231213"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170706"],"TimeCreated":["231213"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170706"],"TimeCreated":["231213"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"557d5f2fb866cce0219b650f25602ae3.jpg","FileDateTime":1509035115,"FileSize":1654456,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3033\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3033,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"16mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/16.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:07 14:25:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.1,"FNumber":16,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:06 23:12:13","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:06 23:12:13","ShutterSpeedValue":3.321928,"ApertureValue":8,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"SubSecTimeOriginal":26,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2625,"ExifImageLength":3115,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":166,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/166","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Yet, this is now, your \u201chome\u201d; and undoubtedly, has many attractions still.\n\n    But why so absorbed in thought?

Reed to N. Kendall)\nWarwick Oct 26. 1855,\nDear Friend:\n\n         Your letter of Sep 6th was very welcomely received. You was truly kind & good in answering my letters so soon, and that, partially atoned for it being a short one. \n    When I received your letter, I certainly thought I should be able to answer it as promptly as you did mine, but this time, \u201cI have been so busy,\u201d must be my excuse. Nearly all the time since I received your last letter, we have had friends with us, & most of my time before & after school, was spent either in riding, ramblings or talking with them; so that I had little time to devote to anything else. I often thought of my absent friends, especially those whom I \u201cowe\u201d, the while & now that my school has finished, they will receive all \n\ndue attention.\n\n    This week we have had friends here from Dedham, & to-day is the only leisure time I have had since I came home, and I am improving a part of it, by writing to my \u201cfriend in the West\u201d. I have been wishing, Oh! Very much to hear from you again, for what you wrote in your last letter has occasioned me, you don\u2019t how many anxious thoughts.  I fear you have have been a much greater suffererer the last few months, than you was previously.\n\n(Written sideways on same page overwriting horizontal script. This is page 5 of this letter)\nMr. Putnam has finished preaching at Petersham. He preached his farewell sermon two weeks ago last sabbath, & has been preaching since at Bernardston. \n\n    I have understood that the reason of his leaving, was that his Parish were rather opposed to Miss Parkhurst as being the intended wife of Mr Putnam, & consequently she refused to marry him so long as he should continue to preach there. So he thought it expedient to leave. There may \"other reasons\" but I am unacquainted with them.\n    I hear from Mary frequently. When last I heard from her, she was quite well.  I do want very much  to see her, I am looking forward with delight to the time off her coming home. Which will be about Thanksgiving-time. Have you given up the idea of visiting New England this Autumn? I hope you have not. We all would be very happy to see you here. We are all well with the exception of Br Charles. He will probably remain with us through the Winter.  Br Chandler desires to be remembered to you with much friendly feeling.  I would be very happy to hear from you, often as you can get time to write.  Hoping this letter will find you better, & that it will be promptly answered. I still remain your affectionate friend,  Abby J Reed \u2014","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":38878,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/38878","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7f412c89e4be52a6f0961dd9a14ed532.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7f412c89e4be52a6f0961dd9a14ed532.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7f412c89e4be52a6f0961dd9a14ed532.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7f412c89e4be52a6f0961dd9a14ed532.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-26T16:26:44+00:00","modified":"2020-07-28T03:34:47+00:00","filename":"7f412c89e4be52a6f0961dd9a14ed532.jpg","authentication":"909546dc50bd29397050542ee8a05506","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_01_fl_01_004_02_o2.jpg","size":1347827,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2933,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042549879405488},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170706"],"TimeCreated":["231308"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170706"],"TimeCreated":["231308"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170706"],"TimeCreated":["231308"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7f412c89e4be52a6f0961dd9a14ed532.jpg","FileDateTime":1509035115,"FileSize":1347827,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2933\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2933,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/16.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:07 14:25:12","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.1,"FNumber":16,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:06 23:13:08","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:06 23:13:08","ShutterSpeedValue":3.321928,"ApertureValue":8,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2342,"ExifImageLength":2874,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":166,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/166","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I did think, when left your preaching & teaching, your lungs would have an opportunity to rest, & eventually sease troubling you.

Just three years before, from that evening, Br Chandler took the hand of that beautiful Bride & claimed her his own, & his looks told, that happiest hour was not forgotten.

She wishes me to give her respects to you, & to tell you she intends to answer your letter, soon after her return to Walpole.

The first passed off so pleasantly, that another was proposed for New Year's Eve, but as a young gentleman from Keene was going back that day we had it Wednesday Evening. We were notified Wednesday morning, & was requested to be at the Hotel at half past five. We according did so. We found there about a dozen other sleighs. which was waiting to be escorted by the Brass Band to Mr. Mayo's, who lives about two miles from our village.

I presume he will not visit us before May. But I am anxious to have him make us a long visit before I go West. I have nearly finished \"Dred\".  I do not like the second volume as well as I did the first. I am surprized at the many low phrases Mrs. Stowe uses.  I cannot imagine where she found them all.

And in fact I do not think any one but yourself, could obtain a certificate from the Town Clerk.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                     THE NEWBERRY LIBRARY","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":39062,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/39062","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/1b9ca9066b5793ad62b98b5ee65030b6.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/1b9ca9066b5793ad62b98b5ee65030b6.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/1b9ca9066b5793ad62b98b5ee65030b6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1b9ca9066b5793ad62b98b5ee65030b6.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-26T16:35:01+00:00","modified":"2020-05-07T04:49:43+00:00","filename":"1b9ca9066b5793ad62b98b5ee65030b6.jpg","authentication":"bbe274a582a7e71062413d8d004f92d9","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_01_fl_02_018_05_o2.jpg","size":1180520,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2258,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048408949250402},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170706"],"TimeCreated":["233703"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170706"],"TimeCreated":["233703"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170706"],"TimeCreated":["233703"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1b9ca9066b5793ad62b98b5ee65030b6.jpg","FileDateTime":1509035125,"FileSize":1180520,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2258\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2258,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/16.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:07 14:27:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.1,"FNumber":16,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:06 23:37:03","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:06 23:37:03","ShutterSpeedValue":3.321928,"ApertureValue":8,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1883,"ExifImageLength":3001,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":166,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/166","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"5TH\n\nNow in regard to the livery stable, I do not know any thing about it myself, but my brother says he thinks they will furnish you with as good a horse & carriage at Winchester as in any of the adjoining towns.

It found us all enjoying most excellent health, which has been our good fortune as a general thing ever since we came to the country.  We returned to this place nearly 3 months ago but have not thus far been near so fortunate as we were on the Yuba River & in fact we have been sinking money more or less ever since we came down here the last time.  We have shares now in a water & mining company which will soon be in operation, we completed our part of the work yesterday we take the water from this place, in a ditch or canal, to the next mining town below, a distance of nearly 7 miles.  If the Diggins there are as rich as it is supposed they are it will be as profitable an investment as we could have made, on the same amount of capital for besides getting water for our own mining operations, each shareholder will have more or less water to sell to other miners.  We expect to move down as soon as the water gets there; so that we can go to mining.

Aunt Sophia, I hardly know how to thank you for the kind admonitions, contained in your letter, but you may rest assured that they will not soon be forgotten; on the contrary we will treasure them up and try to profit by them, for there is not place in the world, where good advice from a friend, is more needed than it is here.  There is no restraint whatever upon the actions of men & the greatest wonder wonder is that affairs are not worse than they are.  As a sample of the way things are carried on I will give you a specimen of what I saw on last Sunday afternoon, Sunday you must know is the principle business day of the week.  On one square in the main business part of the city -- a minister mounted an empty goods box to preach a sermon to the crowd, as he said he could not get a congregation large enough to preach to at the church which was recently erected & while he was preaching 3 large gambling houses with splendid bands of music were in full blast within a few doors & the gingling of the specie on the monte tables & the sound of the music formed a strange contrast when compared with the voice of the minister preaching to the motley crowd in the open street while from numerous waggons loaded with goods men were auctioneering off the remnants of their stock.  The next thing worthy of note was a crowd rushing out of one of the gaming houses pell mell some drunk & some sober, some bloody and others with their coats off ready for a fight, which had been commenced in the house and as usual ends in the street.  Such scenes as these and many others are nothing unusual; of a Sunday more especially, but you can have no proper conception of these things unless you were here to see for yourself & that of course would be the last thing you would think of.\nJack & Frank wish to be remembered most affectionately to you both & say they will write soon.

I think uncle Harvey, if I know myself as I believe I do that you laboring under a false impression in regard, to the reference, made to the sale of the Columbia Property, in one of my letters home & I think you will certainly be of a different opinion when the matter is explained, for I am not in the habit of doing things underhandedly or without an assignable cause or reason, and as to my being ungenerous or ungrateful to you or any one else for any favours or assistance, I may have recived & more especially as it regards yourself, for you ought to know me well enough, to know that I shall allways (let my circumstances in life be what they may) consider myself largely indebted to you in point of gratitude at least.  I will here give you the reason why I did it & hope it will be satisfactory.  When I was starting to California last spring after I had told mother & sister the actual state of my affairs, they asked me as well as I can recollect, if I had any thing left in Cincinnati & I told them I had not but that some time during the fall or winter previous you had offered me 60 or 100$ for my services or interest of 20 per cent on the proffits & that I told you, (which you probably recollect) that I thought you would not be doing justice to yourself to give that much & so the matter rested.  I then told them that when you sold the lots, if they paid a proffit amounting to anything of consequence over & above expenses & if your other land speculations proved very profitable & you saw proper to allow me any thing on it you could do so, but that of course was to be discretionary with you for I did not consider you indebted to me at all.

When I wrote to you last from Sacramento City we were then selling goods in Nevada City & I was down for the purpose of laying in a fresh supply, but when I returned to Nevada from the City I found that every thing was so much overdone in the way of trading (from the fact that every person that was able to go into such operations at all had flocked there for the purpose of going into business) that our safest plan was to sell out what we had on hand & go to mining again.  We had bought fixtures also for the purpose of setting up a Boarding House which we also sold out without much trouble We sold out every thing we had on hand except a house & lot in Nevada City which is yet unsold we will probably loose something on that as property has fallen very much since we bought.\n[written along left margin and top]\nI see by an advertisement in the Cincinnati Commercial that a suit has been brought against me & Uncle Harvey for the foreclosure of a mortgage that was on the Columbia Property.  I suppose from that that the lots were not likely to bring a proffit & Uncle Harv. prefered letting them make the money out of the land to paying if off and risk making himself safe which I expect is well enough for I feared that it would go down before another season to bring it into market","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":55609,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/55609","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/901a8daa6bee2c304c5e1f90ec3cafc0.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/901a8daa6bee2c304c5e1f90ec3cafc0.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/901a8daa6bee2c304c5e1f90ec3cafc0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/901a8daa6bee2c304c5e1f90ec3cafc0.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-08T21:44:17+00:00","modified":"2020-01-24T20:38:06+00:00","filename":"901a8daa6bee2c304c5e1f90ec3cafc0.jpg","authentication":"396c6b9a454c2aba938ab5d3bfc66588","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"GR_3151_0014_o2.jpg","size":1316232,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2511,"resolution_y":3094,"compression_ratio":0.056473430287472002608861743055967963300645351409912109375},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"By-line":["K"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"By-line":["K"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0002"],"By-line":["K"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":879,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/879","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"We have now been here about two weeks it is the same place that we did our first mining & we will remain here untill the River rises in the spring & as it is probable that the communication between here and the Sacramento Valley will be entirely cut off during the winter (from the immense depth of the snow on the mountains) you need not be uneasy if you do not hear from us again for 3 or 4 months but if at any time during the winter we find it at all practicable to get from here to Nevada City with a letter we will not fail to write.

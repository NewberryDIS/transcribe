It was very brief, but very sweet, and I drank it in as a sponge takes in water, mentally praying that it might take as fast hold of her heart.  The theme was Christ, the Saviour of lost souls; as illustrated by this parable of the lost sheep.

His hearty encouragement and co-operation in the work of this Mission (although his church is at least a quarter of a mile nearer to it than the McDougal Street Church) is truly Christian, and quite a contrast to the rule of conduct of our pastor.

He answered my prayer immediately as before related; by changing my business, and matters looked fair for success; but I had no sooner got comfortably under way then the Piano business fell flat all over the city, and not a piano have I sold to this day; subjecting me to actual loss of over two hundred dollars.

Surely here must be some mistake.  Was there an unclear between the death of Jehoram and the crowning of Ahaziah?  I look at the margin, and it says Jehoram reigned 889 years B.C.; and Joash, the son of Ahaziah was seven years old when he began to reign, which, according Chap. XXIII, 1, was about seven years after the death of his father - in the margin, 878, B.C.

As long as Israel was conscious of an enemy before him, against whom he must fight in order to inherit the land, he had a lively sense of his need of God his Saviour, and he strove manfully against the one and put his whole trust and confidence in the Other; but when he were? at ease in Zion he forgot God, trusted in","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":106638,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/106638","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/32b612443c25b008c6b6442d5eaca076.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/32b612443c25b008c6b6442d5eaca076.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/32b612443c25b008c6b6442d5eaca076.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/32b612443c25b008c6b6442d5eaca076.jpg"},"added":"2020-09-25T02:56:55+00:00","modified":"2020-11-02T16:17:45+00:00","filename":"32b612443c25b008c6b6442d5eaca076.jpg","authentication":"4299c9ea61ee50b4360acb79ea140d82","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_815_VL03_00084r_o2.jpg","size":1227102,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1794,"resolution_y":2317,"compression_ratio":0.09840358861769600562485749151164782233536243438720703125}},"item":{"id":1311,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1311","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I plead my cause before Him, and trust in His loving-kindness and mercy; for all His judgments are righteousness, and I know that \"our light afflictions, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.\"  The Lord deal with me as seemeth good in His sight.

To-night I have weighed myself in the ballance of God's judgement. First, I put in my repentance in one scale and God's mercy in the other and the former rose up like a feather - I then tried my faith in one scale with God's love in the other and faith flew up like the feather and disappeared. I next tried all my agony, and fears, and tears for sin, with a portion of the seeat from Jesus brow and they ascended with a unclear and were not. Again I put in one scale all the good deeds I had done, with a thorn from Jesus' crown in the other, when up went all my works and were scattered out of sight. Then I essayed my righteousness against a bit of the beautiful garment of Christ, and away it went, quicker than thought, into nothing. I then put my repentance, faith, agony, tears, fears, good deeds, my righteousness and all I possess in one side, and one drop of the precious blood of Jesus in the other, and up again these all went together and vanished in black smoke, while the pre-","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":106660,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/106660","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/27b1391d8ef6cd35f7435805fb33081a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/27b1391d8ef6cd35f7435805fb33081a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/27b1391d8ef6cd35f7435805fb33081a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/27b1391d8ef6cd35f7435805fb33081a.jpg"},"added":"2020-09-25T02:57:11+00:00","modified":"2020-11-02T16:17:45+00:00","filename":"27b1391d8ef6cd35f7435805fb33081a.jpg","authentication":"eba97ac7d0c61148d2574ec6e8ac94ea","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_815_VL03_00095r_o2.jpg","size":1212694,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1794,"resolution_y":2311,"compression_ratio":0.09750066772248000557254954401287250220775604248046875}},"item":{"id":1311,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1311","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Page 185\nThen again, look at that infirm old man, passing up the street, without sufficient to clothe him this winter day, whose haggard face indicates that he has eaten nothing for a day at least - And there is a young and beautiful woman with an infant in her arms, seated upon the curbstone and earning a daily pittance by her music.

So many troubles have come\nupon me that I cannot conclude otherwise than\nthat I have either done wickedly - that is more than\nthe ordinary weaknesses of the flesh, for there are none\nthat sinneth not - or that they are trials of my faith\nIf the latter, thank the Lord for the grace that\nI do not for a moment doubt His goodness, loving\nkindness and mercy, or any of His promises,\nbut feel in my heart that \"The sufferings of\nthis present time are not worthy to be compared with\nthe glory that shall be revealed to us,\" and that they\nwork  out for us \"a far more exceeding and eternal\nweight of glory.\"  That I have lived a day during\n1867 without sin, it would be vile for me to say, and","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":106667,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/106667","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/a19e4a1a36ca64cc9f2f65414636c3d5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/a19e4a1a36ca64cc9f2f65414636c3d5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/a19e4a1a36ca64cc9f2f65414636c3d5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a19e4a1a36ca64cc9f2f65414636c3d5.jpg"},"added":"2020-09-25T02:57:16+00:00","modified":"2020-11-08T23:02:22+00:00","filename":"a19e4a1a36ca64cc9f2f65414636c3d5.jpg","authentication":"bf8f82f26e7b72a4fc25b9ee252774c6","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_815_VL03_00098_o2.jpg","size":1048909,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1849,"resolution_y":2327,"compression_ratio":0.081261205858224994091898452097666449844837188720703125}},"item":{"id":1311,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1311","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"my soul doth magnify the Lord, for all His goodness and loving kindness to me.\nTuesday, Dec. 31st - With this day 1867 goes out - to me a disasterous year - a year lost, and with its loss I lose every thing else that I possess, except my hope and trust in God. In reviewing the year I have nothing with which to congratulate myself.  My talent has not been improved; my labors in the vineyard of the Lord have brought forth no fruit; and I have done many things I ought not to have done, and left undone many things I ought to have done.  Every thing that I have undertaken in a business way has failed. I commenced just one year ago with fifteen hundred dollars in bank, and expectation of three thousand more from Internal Revenue cases, and this day I am worse than nothing. My judgement has been at fault every way, more particularly so in the affair of the Piano business - though I still believe the change was Providential at the time.

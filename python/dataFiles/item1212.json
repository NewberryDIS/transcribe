Robertson and his wife A.E.W. Robertson, lists of letters received and written, 1862-1864, and poems. Diary entries are both daily and summarized accounts of Wiles\u2019 service with Company D, briefly in Missouri, but mainly at various Arkansas locations including Batesville, Jacksonport, De Vals Bluff, Fort Smith, Fort Gibson, at the Neosho River, and Little Rock. Wiles notes his company\u2019s movements (including escorting Confederate Maj. Gen. Herron to Fort Smith), picket and scout duty, and other military routine. He describes shortages of provisions for soldiers and their mounts, particularly at Fort Smith and Fort Gibson. He mentions Negroes following the marching troops, harassment by bushwhackers and the large number of Cherokee bushwhackers, encounters with Confederate forces (including those commanded by Gen. Shelby), and President Lincoln\u2019s death. Wiles\u2019 transcribed 1862 letters from the Robertsons inform him of their intent to send him gospels and hymns in the Creek language, and of the status of dispersed of mission school staff and students. Poems, probably composed by Wiles, include one to a Luvanna Hills. <a href=\"https:\/\/webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu\/nby\/cgi-bin\/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=183037\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View catalog record<\/a>","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":41,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/41","name":"Description","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/2f13fd7de48d0eb683a12f63ac7c9de5.jpg","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":48,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/48","name":"Source","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Diaries; Indians of North America; American Civil War (1861-1865)","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":49,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/49","name":"Subject","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Union soldier who served as corporal in Company D of the 11th Missouri Cavalry Regiment","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":46,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/46","name":"Relation","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}

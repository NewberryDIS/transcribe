The people were all seated and observed perfect silence. No one durst speak, or make the least noise while the priest was talking. About noon the priest became very much fatigued, but still continued his discourse till near sunset.  He enforced obedience to God in every respect, telling the people they must do all that God had directed them and never disobey in any secret place, thinking themselves alone; for God always saw them, and was with them.  He exhorted the people never to indulge in any idle or vain conversation, nor call anyone A ski ni, because it was wicked.  He urged them to abstain from all lewdness and from Polygamy. Children he exhorted to be industrious and alwas ming their parents. \n  He enforced his exhortations by holding up to the people the prospects of futurity, assuring that if they were obedient, when they died, they would go to God, and dwell forever with Him, where it would be always light, like a pleasant delightful day.  But that if they were disobedient, they would be miserable forever in a lake of fire.  That just as they got to that place an awful gulph would appear before them, across which they would see a small pole, with a black dog at each end.  Being impelled forward, they would go onto the middle of this pole, and then the dogs would turn it, and plunge them off into the gulph or lake of fire.  Some few, however, might be permitted to cross, but on arriving at the other side, they would be put into a house of fire, and transfixed with large iron spikes, and thus tortured forever. \n  At death the righteous & wicked would be immediately separated; and the wicked driven forward in a different path from the righteous.  \n  Just before sunset the priest offered sacrifice.  The altar was made of flat rock about 2 1\/2 feet high, of one stone or more.  The sacrifice was a piece of meat, with a powder of old tobacco sprinkled on.  The fire was not common, but made new, as follows viz. the priest put a dry stick on the altar, with a round shallow hole in the upper side.  In this hole he put some of the weed called Golden rod.  He then took a stick 2 or 3 feet long, the lower end of which exactly filled the hole or socket above mentioned.  This stick, standing upright in the hole, on the golden rod, he whisked swiftly round, till the golden rod caught fire in the socket.

The man obeyed -- but his warning had no effect. The messenger was sent again with the message; but again the warning was unavailing. So also the third time, the messenger was then sent to direct the man to build a house that would float on the water, and go into it with his family, and take in some of all kinds of animals.  This he did.  God caused the animals to come to him, and then the doors of the house were shut and the rain commenced.  The people tried to save themselves on hills but were at length all drowned. After some time the man opened a place and sent out a raven to look for dry land, but finding none he returned to the house.  After some time again he sent out a turtle dove.  This bird returned with mud in its claws, which showed that the earth began to appear.  Raven (a blind man) The above person viz the Raven image above the word \"Raven\" (supposed to be considerably upwards of a hundred years old.) says that when a small boy, the old men used to predict the destruction of the world, after four generations, in the following manner.  The Lord would cause a storm to rise out of the east, which would rain pitch till every thing was covered with it.  This being followed by a storm of fire, would be set in a blaze, and consume the whole world. The Natchez Indians say that sometime after the creation, children began to marry very young, and have children of their own; and at length some children were born with full sets of teeth.  God was displeased, and sent a dog to tell a certain man, that on account of the weakness of the people, in twelve nights He would cause the water to gush out of the ground and destroy them all.  Therefore he must make a raft of twelve plank, and take his family and the dog onto it that they might be preserved.  He did so, and at the set time the water gushed out of the ground and bore the family up above all the hills and trees.  But nothing else, not a log, nor anything swam, but every thing lay just as it was, so that the people could bi no means save themselves from drowning.  On the seventh day after the flood came, the waters dried away.  This man then went out, taking with him, & his family, the dog & fire; and God told him then that the world should not be again destroyed by water, but by fire.  Sometime after the flood, people came to this man for fire speaking different languages; and at length one came speaking his language, that is, the Natchy tongue. citation: yz wi yo

The people, on seeing him approaching, with perfect silence took their seats in the house. On reaching the house, the procession walked round in silence four times. The bearers then let down the platform within three feet of the ground, and a person appointed took the candidate on his back, and carried him to his appropriate white seat in the back part of the house. His seat was covered with a dressed deer skin, chalked, or made white as possible; and the ground under his feet was spread with a mattress of cane, covered with a large buck skin, made white like the other. (Previous to this the candidate had fasted six days, this made the seventh.) A speaker was then sent for four different ways, & at four different times, before a suitable person could be found. On his arrival, he made a very lengthy speech to the people, and at the conclusion directed all to salute the king. Each one then went individually near his seat, and bowing, said, Toa ky wi hi tro lo. To which he replied, he replied Ho. Then all sat down in silence all night. At daybreak the king made his speech to the people, in which he promised to exercise his authority in all respects according to the commandments of God; after which all the people promised obedience to him. The assembly then continued in their seats till about noon, when the young people withdrew. The lower officers filled his tobacco pouch with old tobacco. This was a part of his dress, hanging on his left shoulder, at his right side. The king then arose, and two of the highest officers, one at each side, putting their hands under his arms, partly supported him, as he held his sceptre with his right hand over his shoulder, and walked, first to the door, and then to his own house. On arriving at his own residence, his official dress was taken off, and put away in a room for the purpose, in a double cane basket having a lid. His face was then washed, and a common dress put on him. This man did not offer sacrifice, and of course was not the high priest. The above ceremonies being ended, all retired, appointing a time when to conduct the king to the council house again, which was in August.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70279,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70279","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b33cffe93028b4d3560402a8554e8051.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b33cffe93028b4d3560402a8554e8051.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b33cffe93028b4d3560402a8554e8051.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b33cffe93028b4d3560402a8554e8051.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:26:24+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:26+00:00","filename":"b33cffe93028b4d3560402a8554e8051.jpg","authentication":"710ce1f42670ed42857112148fd4c5cd","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL03_FL001_00014_o2 copy.jpg","size":849279,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2887,"compression_ratio":0.054476580841319},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b33cffe93028b4d3560402a8554e8051.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423560,"FileSize":849279,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2887\"","Height":2887,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2887,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:06:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":814,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5601},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:18 13:56:24","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:18 13:56:24","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":89,"SubSecTimeDigitized":89,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2887,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":1051,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1051","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"20 that time arriving all assembled again, brought victuals of various kinds, and carried the king as before.

With these beads from the council the man received full authority from the U ku, & national council to hold the first of green fruits in that particular town.  citation:  Nusawi.  The above plan of authorizing each town to hold the green fruit feast separately, was probably adopted to prevent the labour and trouble of all meeting together. The councils were appointed by the U ku, and his privy council. The other chiefs, however, if they saw any special cause for a national council, had a right to request it; and in that case the U ku complied with their wishes. This sometimes rendered the councils irregular. But the general time for the national council was in the spring, before the feast of first fruits. On calling a council, the U ku raised the national standard at the council house. This consisted of a very long pole, painted white, (with white clay) - on the top was painted a certain kind, and to the top was fastened a white cloth (or white dressed deerskin) four or five yards long, having red spots like stars painted on it. This being raised the U ku dispatched his messenger to the nearest town, giving notice to the priest residing there. He caught the intelligence, & hastened his messenger to another town: & thus the news was spread almost instantly through the nation, as the messengers were on the wing night & day till the information was spread, especially, if there was any urgent business.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70282,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70282","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d38d55bad3a13ab49adb3962e18ece5b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d38d55bad3a13ab49adb3962e18ece5b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d38d55bad3a13ab49adb3962e18ece5b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d38d55bad3a13ab49adb3962e18ece5b.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:26:27+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:26+00:00","filename":"d38d55bad3a13ab49adb3962e18ece5b.jpg","authentication":"f1cc39f3ce241c2712e15eef7d1a52f4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL03_FL001_00015_o2.jpg","size":478463,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2918,"compression_ratio":0.030364722158759},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d38d55bad3a13ab49adb3962e18ece5b.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423561,"FileSize":478463,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2918\"","Height":2918,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2918,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:06:34","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":814,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":2056},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:18 14:01:52","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:18 14:01:52","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":34,"SubSecTimeDigitized":34,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2918,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":1051,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1051","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"23  ++ These sticks of beads were about six inches long.

But in case danger was apprehended the U ku and the great warrior & suit, all smoked the tobacco together. The U ku then hoisted the national flag, and dispatched his messenger to give notice to the council to be immediately convened. The council coming together and determining on war, hastened to paint the national standard, and flag red. They also painted themselves, red, together with their bows and arrows, warclubs, and other weapons of war.  The council selected four physicians, one for each war party (the whole body of soldiers were divided into four companies.)  Seven counsellors were then selected, one of each clan, to direct in each company, in all twenty eight, seven for each of the four companies.

The priests right hand man then selected seven counsellors, one from each clan, to assist on the occasion & to fast, together with seven women selected from the seven clans. He also selected seven men to cleanse the council house - repair the altar, new whitewash all the benches, posts, joists, and vessels for the occasion, & to whip the houses (to drive away the evil spirits) He then selected seven men to hunt, and others to provide the articles for purification. (All articles used for healing or curing the diseases of the body, and for cleaning bodily or mental defilements, are called by one general name nu wa ti, which we translate medicine.) The next morning the priest and his right hand man, the seven counsellors, and the seven women commenced fasting, and for six days ate only once in twenty four hours left margin, vertical note: Confirm a little after sunset and then nothing but light food (enquire).

This is always circular, i.e. the dancers always move round in a circle, having the centre of the circle at the left hand.

The ancient idolaters (probably) by these dances intended to attribute the progressive rotations of the earth & planets in their circular orbits to the independent power of their God the heavens; and the performance of this service by believers was disregarded to reclaim those motions to Jehovah, as the original author of them. Parkhurst under the word Hebrew: Gimmel Chet As the religious dances of the Jews were circular, so especially are those of the Indians. strikeout: All Their dances, at religious festivals, all their ball play dances, and war dances are all performed in the same manner.

The flesh pieces were pounded and boiled, & the bony pieces boiled by themselves. Bread was made of dry new corn pounded; and also mush and homany. Potatoes, beans, & all kinds of same they had were cooked & brought forward. Long branches were set in the council house hard, and the provision placed in order upon them. The priest then, after praying, directed all to eat. This was just before sunset.  The seven counsellors, however, and the seven women appointed to fast, must not eat till about dark, and then priest & his right hand man were obliged to wait still longer before eating.  On this night the people danced till about midnight and then such as wished could go home & sleep. (But according to some the women danced all night.) On the second day the seven whippers went through with all the ceremonies of the first day, and distributed the meat, but the yo wea was not sung, and the people generally could eat during the day at the houses in the town, but the priest, his right hand man, seven counsellors & the seven women continued still to fast as the day before. A little before sunset victuals was brought as on the first day and all ate except the sixteen mentioned above. The third day passed as the second in all respects, and the fourth was as the first. The Yo wa was sung three times, the whippers proceeded as usual, the meat was distributed, all fasted till near sunset -- all bathed in the afternoon plunging seven times as on the first day -- the sacrifice was offered, and the oracle u lu sa ta consulted, victuals and all at the direction of the priest as before.

That used in war was the largest, that used by the civil priests in the various feasts and purifications at home, was next in size. The one used at the hunters feasts, and in various ceremonies connected with hunting was the next.   After this was one used for finding things lost or stolen and last of all was that used for determining the time any one had to live.   These stones are chrystalline quartz, with six sides, coming to a point at one end like the diamond, are perfectly transparent, and were doubtless selected instead or to take the place of the diamond used by the ancients, shaped thus, diagram of 5-sided structure resembling a house, only regular in its parts. These are called tru lu sa ta]] i.e. Lights.  One for instance is called U lu sa ta, light, not light simply, that would be i ku ku ti, but this is light shining, or passing through something, as through glass.+  These tru lu sa ta were used only by persons devoted in infancy, or childhood to sacred offices, and trained up accordingly.  Some were devoted by their parents to sacred offices in infancy, or rather inherited by hereditary right such offices. In case the child was to be thus set apart, the priest who was to have the care of his education was called as soon as the child was born, to take it under his tuition. Before it was put to the breast he gave it a kind of purifying drink; and as the child was not able to fast, he directed the parents to fast for it seven days, eating only at night about sunset.  As the child grew up he was watched with the utmost scrutiny. And as the mother was liable to her monthly courses, the son was delivered as soon as possible into the hands of a grand mother or some aged matron, not subject to any female defilements; and her eye was almost continually upon him.  She would not allow him to go into any house as he pleased and sit down lest he should be defiled by some polluted seat.  Neither must he eat any food but such as his protectress pronounced clean.  She also guarded him from any defilement from the dead.  As he became capable of understanding he was taken to the priest who spent occasionally twenty hours with him, without eating or sleeping, instructing him in the great doctrines and duties of religion, but especially in those ceremonies connected with the use of the Tou lu sa ta. If devoted to war, the arts &c. of war were especially informed on his mind.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70299,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70299","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4ae4c6269c0992a0f300835e573f71e5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4ae4c6269c0992a0f300835e573f71e5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4ae4c6269c0992a0f300835e573f71e5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4ae4c6269c0992a0f300835e573f71e5.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:26:43+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:26+00:00","filename":"4ae4c6269c0992a0f300835e573f71e5.jpg","authentication":"a60dd1904a421113dff4e4837e6b17c6","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL03_FL001_00024_o2.jpg","size":497373,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

 Sometimes sons were not consecrated to sacred office till eight or nine years old. In this case the priest took the boy about day light onto a high hill, gave him the water of purification, the same given to the infant; and then ordered him to look toward the east, so as to catch the first rays of light from the rising sun, and then follow that orb with his eyes, not looking off till its last rays were lost in the western horizon; and thus the boy did.  The old man stayed by him, observing a strict fast during the day.  Should the boy during the day take his eyes from the sun, the rule would be violated. At night the priest took the boy and spent the whole night in walking with him in this silent retreat, giving him instructions on various subjects, but especially respecting the use and soundness of the Tsu lu sa ta.  Early the next morning the priest took the boy to a very secret, retired place on the mountain, where they would be sure not to see a woman.  Here he instructed him again in the various duties of his intended office.  A little after sunset this day they ate some of the root of which the purifying drink was made.  They had now fasted forty eight hours, i.e. two days and nights & one night without sleep.  In this retreat they continued five days more, eating nothing but the above mentioned root, and that only once a day, a little after sunset; only on the seventh day and night they watched and fasted twenty four hours, not eating or sleeping.  On the morning of the eighth day, the priest took the ri lu sa ta, to enquire how long the boy was to use it.  On looking at this stone, if they saw an old man with white hair, and or white beard, they understood that the boy was to live to very old age.  But if in the stone was seen a man with black hair and black beard, they boy would die young.  The priest then took the boy to a river, and ordered him to wade in, and stand facing the east, while he stood on the bank, with his face in the same direction and prayed for him.  After prayers, he ordered the boy to plunge entirely seven times, first with his head toward the east, then toward the west, then east & alternately.

This was called osi, the same name or a hot house.  This being on the bank of a river, when his pupils were in a profuse sweat, he ordered them to plunge immediately into the river. They must plunge entirely seven times.  After this they might marry.

Suppose two young men conceived a peculiar fondness for each other, and desired to enter into the strongest bonds of perpetual friendship, they went to that feast or fast of purification when the yo was was sung: taking an opportunity, sometime during that feast, when the people were seated in the council house, they arose, walked toward the fire, and then turned and commenced dancing round the fire, what is called the A to hu na, or friendship dance, each having on his best clothes.  While dancing in the presence of all the people, while looking, thus exchanged one garment after another till each had given the other his entire dress, even to legings, mocasins &c. and thus each of them publicly received the other as himself, & became thus pledged to regard and treat him as himself while he lived.  Sometimes two women, and sometimes a man and a woman contracted this friendship.  Thus when a young man and woman fell in love with each other but were hindered from marrying, either by relations or by being of the same clan, they bound themselves in perpetual friendship.  While dancing round the fire as above stated, the man throws his blanket over the woman, and the woman as soon as convenient threw hers to the man.  The man also having prepared a cane sieve, & hung it by a string over his shoulder, gave her that. He also presented her with a pestle to pound corn with.  The mortar he had for her at home.  Friends among the Cherokees, must share with each other whatever they might have.  They must also, if requested always reveal whatever secret they might know.

The family would then prepare victuals and carry onto the mountain, or near the place where their friend was buried, and set it on a rock or some other conspicuous place, & these little spirits would trouble them no more.  It is said that a man once died and his spirit afterward kept always about the house till the family prepared victuals & placed them on a rock near his grave, and then the spirit spoke to the person who put the victuals there & troubled the family no more.  Witches were living persons assisted by some evil spirit.  Anciently, it is said, these were very dangerous, so that it was not safe for persons to be out after dark.  They would frequently come about houses, and knock, knock, knock about in various parts of the house.  The head of the family+ then filled his pipe with old tobacco, and smoked about in the house & out, blowing the smoke in every direction.  At length some of the smoke would get into the witch's throat and produce a strikeout: sneething sneezing, and then all the family were secure.  The witch would immediately depart, and in a day or two would be dead, certainly in seven days after inhaling the tobacco smoke.  When one was sick in a house, witches would be constantly flocking about it, therefore the old tobacco had to be smoked there continually.  Witches would sometimes get in some corner of the house and sing like an owl, and again, make various kinds of noises.  citation: Nutrawi.

But if they had not a wire they daubed pitch on their faces, and by means of that pulled out the beard with their fingers.  citation: T. Smith.  Formerly many wore a long beard, yet some considered it unbecoming, and therefore pulled out their own beards, and doctored their sons by rubbing something on their faces to prevent the beard from growing.  citation: Zacheriah.  The Raven, supposed to be considerably over one hundred years old, & now blind, says that anciently the Cherokee men uniformly wore a long beard, as their fathers had done, & considered it peculiarly ornamental.  It seldom grew over six inches long.  It was considered an almost unpardonable offense to seize a man by his beard.  When one did it, he was generally killed by witches before another morning.  The Raven says that when a lad, he feared his beard would not be so thick and long as was desirable; and being told what to do to promote its growth, he commenced doctoring it.  He accordingly took the skin, with the long hair on it, from the underside of the lower unclear of a Buffalo, and chestnut burrs, and burnt them together, and took the ashes and coal of the skin, and mixed them with bears oil, and rubbed the mixture on his face.  The medicine, however, proved ineffectual, and he never had as heavy a beard as he had desired.  Some platted their beards, one braid hanging from each side of the mouth, & one from the chin; though more generally it hung loose.  That on the upper lip, was either pulled out, or kept cut about half an inch long, so as not to hang over the mouth.  The Raven says that the old men used to tell them that the ancient Cherokees had always been in the habit of wearing a long beard.  About the same time that the Cherokees commenced pulling out their beards (probably 80, or 100 years ago) they also began the custom of pulling out the hair, so as to form a ring round the crown, about two inches wide, leaving a tuft on the crown about as large as the palm of the hand.  Men began thus to pull out the hair when about forty or forty five years old, and would continue pulling it till at length it would not grow, and the skin from which it was pulled appeared as if no hair had ever grown on it.  Thus, though the Indians are far from being beardless, yet their manner of living, and their not shaving when young men, are evident causes of their not having early or heavy beards. -- Certain Cherokees who have been with the Creeks say that some of them are uncircumcised. The Cherokees call this by as name which signifies cutting off the end.  citation: Nutrawi.  E. Hicks   Anciently all the Cherokees wore a long beard on their chin. -- citation: MG.

In this the holy fire was constantly kept burning, but should it go out new fire must be made.  But in case the warriors of each town chose to have a war priest from each of their respective towns they could do so, and the seven counsellors of each war chief could appoint their respective priests.  The seven counsellors appointed women to prepare provision for the army.  This consisted of parched corn mean, and corn bread.  The bread was made in long cakes, about six inches wide.  This was baked on the hot hearth, covered with leaves and hot ashes.  In general each town furnished provision for its own men.  The warriors carried their own provisions.  Of course on some expeditions they were heavily loaded when they first started.  They also furnished themselves with weapons, and armour.  Their war club & in later times their tomahawk, they carried in the belt.  The whole army being assembled, a day and night were devoted prayer, fasting, and wakefulness.  None must eat or sleep.  And no one must take anything whatever from the house of another, but the thing to be passed from one to another, must be dropped on the ground and picked up.  On this day the seven counsellors above mentioned appointed the under officers for the first company, musicians, Doctor, cooks, &c. &c.  Then seven counsellors from the next two towns appointed officers & for their strikeout: town company & so on, each two towns forming together one company.  The principal officers were as follows, viz. First.  The great war chief, now called the Raven, has a raven skin fastened about his neck.  Second, the Ka ta ti ka ne hi, or flag carrier, considered an equal in almost all respects with the first.  The flag was raised on a hole painted red, and consisted of a red cloth, or a deer skin painted red.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70319,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70319","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/cdc1bd37d81f1dead414df146e587959.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/cdc1bd37d81f1dead414df146e587959.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/cdc1bd37d81f1dead414df146e587959.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cdc1bd37d81f1dead414df146e587959.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:27:02+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:26+00:00","filename":"cdc1bd37d81f1dead414df146e587959.jpg","authentication":"740aab5d61fc968773bbf585839e31f2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL03_FL001_00037_o2 copy.jpg","size":951436,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":3017,"compression_ratio":0.058399685731472},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cdc1bd37d81f1dead414df146e587959.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423562,"FileSize":951436,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"3017\"","Height":3017,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":3017,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:06:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":814,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5536},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:18 14:11:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:18 14:11:01","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":2,"SubSecTimeDigitized":2,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":3017,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":1051,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1051","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"60   Third Ska.li lo ski, or the great speaker.

These had been initiated into sacred officers by looking at the sun &c.  Fourth Ku. ni ko ti, or surgeon.  Each town chief, called A ska yu gu sta, was at the head of his own mess, though all were marshalled under the general command of the great warrior.

The priest & his assistant, the Doctor, and cooks, marched behind their respective companies, while the drummers &c. marched in the centre.  On the morning of this fast day none were compelled to bathe, yet any might do it who chose, and on the evening of this day, after the various appointments, and arrangements were made, the war standard was erected.  This consisted of a very high pole painted red, with a red cloth or skins four or five yards long fastened to the top.  Around this the war dance was celebrated during the night.+ A little before day all were ordered to the river, where they plunged entirely seven times.  Just at day break the priest for the war, swept and made clean a spot of earth and took some of the holy fire, and kindled with certain kinds of wood, free from rot and worms.  He then stood on the west side of the fire, facing the east, with his assistant at his right hand, and the seven counsellors behind him to observe the sacrifice.  All being stationed, with the meat (deers tongue) in his hand he prayed to know what would be the fate of the war, and then put the tongue on the fire.  Now if the fire burnt bright and clear, and soon consumed the sacrifice, they were to conquer their enemies; but in case the fire went out round the meat, so as not to consume it, they were to be conquered.  The sacrifice the priest, fixed a stool (or his red post) and folded the seven deer skins, and put on it, and then set his u lu sa ta on the skins.  This was a little after sun rise.

God commanded the whole nation to meet at the feast of green fruits.  (Tarapin head.)  This was the greatest of the feasts (Bone) This feast was held four days The priest, his right hand man, his seven counsellors, one from each clan, and also seven women of the seven clans commenced fasting six days previous to the beginning of the feast.  They ate only once in twenty four hours, a little after dark.  The hunters also, in the chief town, commenced hunting at the same time.  The first buck that was shot was for sacrifice.  The chief hunter therefore, stepped up, and before touching it in any other place, took hold of his tongue, and cut off a piece from the end of the right side, -- wrapped it in old leaves of the last year, and put it up for sacrifice.  The man who shot the deer, then skinned and dressed it, & barbicued the meat.  The meat of this buck, the skin, and the skins of all the deer killed on this occasion were the property of the priest, and delivered to his right hand man on the return of the hunters, but the priest must not eat any of the meat of the buck till he has offered the tongue for sacrifice.  On the evening of the sixth day the hunters came in with the meat barbecued, which was deposited in a house at the west side of the council house for the purpose of storing away meat, -- first fruit, &c. at the national feasts and also for depositing or treasuring up provisions brought for the priests and old men that lived at the council house.  On the same evening also the whole nation assembled at the council house, and the night was spend in dancing.

At last he mounted the summit, and became able to read, fluently the said page. The political changes and troubles of the nation never appeared to affect him, till a short time before they were taken prisoners, by the United States troops.

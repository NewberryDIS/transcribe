are coming--when so as to make my calculations accordingly--If you don't want to come, or think it not expedient to come--you need not consider it necessary for you to, on my account for I can go back alone without any difficulty or danger I think.--Tho' it might be pleasanter to have company.\nIf any thing should prevent your coming and I do not hear from you before that time I think I shall start for home about the 25 of this month You need not feel that it is any great affair or needs any great preparation--you can come from Bangor here in 24 hours at the cost of about 4, or 4,50 & you won't want to stay more than a week you can see all the folks you'll want to see--as long as you'll want to see them--I have been down on the Brook one day which is all I care about it is so long since I've seen 'em much & I feel so unacquainted that I don't care to stay any where except with sisters\nWhen I came I left the Greenfield port at Grants and got into the Brattleborough Cars & came on to Northfield and Mr. Parsons  brought me out here You can do the same or stop at Wendall which is about as near here if I could know just when you'd come I guess I could get Mariah to go down there

it seems really unfortunate and much to be regretted that he has not been here these 5 or 6 weeks while they would","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98192,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/98192","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/e350958ba9647fd1151ed620f9343b8c.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/e350958ba9647fd1151ed620f9343b8c.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/e350958ba9647fd1151ed620f9343b8c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e350958ba9647fd1151ed620f9343b8c.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:53:14+00:00","modified":"2020-08-20T02:59:03+00:00","filename":"e350958ba9647fd1151ed620f9343b8c.jpg","authentication":"0edf46c327c7c61a67de6eafd99332c8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_92_013_002_o2.jpg","size":1121801,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2239,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046391452864209},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["032833"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["032833"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["032833"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e350958ba9647fd1151ed620f9343b8c.jpg","FileDateTime":1587318754,"FileSize":1121801,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2239\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2239,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"10mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:43:22","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:11 03:28:33","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:11 03:28:33","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1702,"ExifImageLength":2736,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1238,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1238","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"have been glad to have him and would have walked over him with so much care and attention to do him good & it certainly would have been a great benefit to him.

I second her wishes & advice with all earnestness in regard to Charlie. As Mrs. Lee says, \"the battle is half over if the first one is brought up right,\" and it does seem to me of great importance that little things be attended to in his case. \"Life is made up of little things\"you know. It does not become such as I to give advice, I know, but your Charlie is a fine natured boy, sensitive, susceptible to impression, capable of making a noble man, a fine specimen of humanity, but it seems to me that he needs very peculiar treatment - very gentle and very firm; more of the latter perhaps, than would be necessary if he had not been a good deal left to himself of late. His will must be bent, but if his spirit is broken, or greatly mortified, it would be his ruin. It seems to me that he must either make a very good character as he grows up, or a very wild, wayward one. It seems to me that the great thing is to keep his confidence, as our Mother did ours. I do feel particularly anxious Albina that the comparatively little ( nevertheless important in their plan) matters of bons, thank you, if you please,  yes sir and no sir, etc. etc. he not neglected - \"here a little & there a little\", will accomplish the matter & if they don't get such things when children there is danger that they will always be boors.

And he needs the rest - exceedingly. If he should go right in three years more with as much care and responsibility as for 3 years past he would be an old man if alive. To have the care & anxiety of recieving and paying out almost half a Million of money in addition to directing so much work was too much. Nettie's health is a good deal better than when she went from here.\n   Eliab has got a beautiful Air tight Stove with a little oven in it & can take in very long wood I wish I had one like it in my room.  The folks are well at the other house - the baby is rather fretful is cutting teeth I suppose.

It has been so muddy & bad and the horse has been gone so that we could not go any where much Tis doubtful whether I can get the cloth like Charlie's pants\n\n[upside down]occur'd to me","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98261,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/98261","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d4997e5083b9376147f01fbf056c039b.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d4997e5083b9376147f01fbf056c039b.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d4997e5083b9376147f01fbf056c039b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d4997e5083b9376147f01fbf056c039b.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:54:44+00:00","modified":"2020-08-21T01:02:21+00:00","filename":"d4997e5083b9376147f01fbf056c039b.jpg","authentication":"82fbbafebd35a1e5f01e6f00556b9077","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_92_034_004_o2.jpg","size":1471734,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2960,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046037725225225},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["033729"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["033729"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["033729"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d4997e5083b9376147f01fbf056c039b.jpg","FileDateTime":1587318757,"FileSize":1471734,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2960\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2960,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"16mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:44:35","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:11 03:37:29","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:11 03:37:29","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2694,"ExifImageLength":3276,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1238,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1238","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"[left-hand side] James thinks he had not better go to school this spring - had better perhaps work for you, wages are very low (many can not get work) & provisions are very high - but you need help I should think some of the time & he could study some when you dont want his work  Tis probable we should be at home next week but it may depend on the weather\n\n                                      Mr. C.W.

Saturday it snow'd some & blow'd very hard all day from the west & continued to blow till Monday night. Before the last snow the fences up the road were all cover'd up and the road fill'd up as high as the fence now I presume the snow is more than 10 feet deep on many places about the house. I wish you could see how deep the snow is. It was said to be full 5 feet in the woods before these two last snows. I wish I could give you some general idea of matters & things here. The Sheep I guess will turn out same as they did that winter that Hiram took some of them. I suppose Uncle Mark was very careful - but perhaps fail'd in judgment I believe he thought best not to give grain to the Sheep in the first part of the winter. I was gone most of the time while he was here which was only 7 or 8 weeks. I think James has very good judgment for a boy about taking care of sheep etc. But of course was more intent upon his school, & having a good time than anything else I think he meant to be faithful. But it was very cold the fodder not very good, no convenience for giving grain to so many Sheep & he you know has to leave 'em from 8 oclock to dark in order to fix & get to school when he work'd to. Sinces James went home we've had a man one week the rest of the time we have depended on little Sumner (tho' Stephen has been here some) Albina has had a hard time taking care & she you know cannot  bear it as Mrs. Caton & some others would, she cant bear up under any little discouragements Stephen dont know anything about taking care at the barn, nor Sumner much Tis said there never was a time when it was so almost impossible to hire help\n\n[upside down throughout letter] you will do well if you can find all I have written hope you are not very much hurried expected to have sent this several days ago, but as we did not have kept filling in more and more - your directions about the farming work will be very useful & necessary I guess we shall get along nicely now but I will have spells of saying Charles must come home.

I often think that I am an stumbling block to others, and shall strenghten the hands of wel doers. Is it  possible that heaven can be my home while it has so few of my thoughts. How can I love my Savour God, with his superlative love and counttence so feebly affects my heart. If Jesus is mine and I am his why am I not constantly enraptured with his beauty and glowing with zeal for his cause. And I now desire to implore pardoning mercy of him how has said, him that cometh unto me shall in no wise be cast out. I think I do try to deny my self and to mortify my sins and lusts, thou I ought to be more strict and resolut, & think I love God and am dispose to acknowlede him just and righteous in all his ways and mercyfull to all his followers. But I am to often discontented with my lot hear and to ready to repine at the hand of proveadence  But when I realise what Bleassings we enjoy more than some part of the human race I think we never ought to complain at any thing that takes place ever so controrary to inclinations but we ought to be recconciled to our lot to hear and to thank our Heavenly Farther that our loins have ? to us in pleases so pesent  Whot reasn have I to rejoice that I am yet shared to plede for mercy, while thousands are called to bide a duie to all things hear below in an unexpected hour that they may think not of.

shall make out now but I will try. last winter my health was very good but in April I was taken with the influenza had a dreadful cough and sore mouth lost my appetite and suffered a great deal for 4 or 5 weeks but after I got up I was pretty well through the summer about four weeks ago my well arm was taken lame it pained me nights but after I got rest I could work all day till last week it was taken worse I was afraid I should I should entirely lose the use of it but it seems to be gaining now but it is very lame yet. if it has been the other arm I should had a Dct. Seen it but that bunch dont trouble us any more than it did two years ago I suppose it grows Some Mr. C is pretty well for a man 72 but he is Deaf and you know he never was like Aaron Bass in the house but Hannah does every thing she can for me So I am well. I suppose you no Esther has gone to Barnam  She said she had been confined there ? years and I suppose had to bear a good deal. She got a little nervous and fretful said she needed some change so she came here and stayed awhile got all ready and Harvey carried her to Brattleboro the last day of Nov then she went in the Stage but had to stay all day and all night in Woodstock So it cost her something but I have had a letter She enjoyed the journey grandly she says I think they are glad to have her there but there is no chance for her to lay up any thing She works very dilligently has a great desire to do good in the world and really has done a great deal of good in this town if she was here and well she would do me good now. I suppose you no Samuel buried his youngest child last winter they both felt the loss greatly it was certainly a lovely child 16 months old. Brother Josephs folks are all healthy and happy as usual Humphrey came home before thanksgiving they had all the children and grandchildren and Isaac came out that morning came up here but promised to go there to supper So we could not keep him. Brother Says he likes his business and they like him very much. I dont no but you have various kinds of trouble but I do think you have great reason to be thankful that you have such a family of children you have had to be father and mother both as it were","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98290,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/98290","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/fb734fda8fbf7457569b3e74dff1fea0.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/fb734fda8fbf7457569b3e74dff1fea0.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/fb734fda8fbf7457569b3e74dff1fea0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fb734fda8fbf7457569b3e74dff1fea0.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:55:23+00:00","modified":"2020-08-21T20:46:12+00:00","filename":"fb734fda8fbf7457569b3e74dff1fea0.jpg","authentication":"e5f39ea352b640507902eef8852f2c01","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_95_003_002_o2.jpg","size":1794354,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2889,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057509134264067},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["034130"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["034130"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["034130"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"fb734fda8fbf7457569b3e74dff1fea0.jpg","FileDateTime":1587318758,"FileSize":1794354,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2889\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2889,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:45:19","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:11 03:41:30","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:11 03:41:30","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2730,"ExifImageLength":3401,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1238,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1238","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"now they have all got up and doing well able and willing to take care of themselves and you too if you need. it is a bad feeling to be helpless and dependent on others but that is what we must all come to sooner or later. my sickness and lameness has allways been short as yet and I have allways been taken good care of \nHannahs health is not very good but she works all the time the children are rather slender Susan is 3 years old just such a lively nervous thing as Abby used to be.

Dec. 1st 1850.\n\nRespected & dear Madam,\n\n                            It has been in my heart for some time past to answer yr kind letter; but I have been wandering about, & knew not where to ask you to direct a reply.\n   Having the prospect of tarrying for a while at least in this place, I now write in the hope of hearing fr you or Mrs. Searle or some one else of the gd folks about yr temporal & spiritual welfare & prospects. I have to acknowledge, in addition to yr letter, two pairs of woollen stockings fr the Ladies' Socy, I believe. Such proofs of kind remembrance, I can assure you, are exceedingly pleasant to use, & they will be pleasant to use in another sense, this Winter.\n  I feel very anxious to know how those who entertained a hope are prospering. Does Harriet still hold to her hope & give evidence that she has reason for so doing? Has James a hope & a gd. ground for it? How does Mrs. Priest prosper, & how is it with Susan Bunefes? Do you know anything about Miss Sturtevant, & Marshy Drake & Marianne Richards? How is it with John yr Nephew (the family name I most strangely forget) & Mrs. Braydon? There were two Boober girls who were somewhat serious; if you cd give me some information about them, it wd be most thankfully recd. I feel anxious to know how the ways of Zion have prospered since I left Milo, whom you now have laboring among you & what the hopes are that the people will enjoy the stated preaching of the word.\n I desire a kind remembrance to Lucy, her little sister & James Searle, as well as to their Mother, also to the Lees, if they are still in town, the Bunefeses?, the Kimballs etc. as you see them.\n\nStg

I know and feel that I am failing body and mind but I am thankful that I can get up and dress myself alone and do my own work after a fashion and then sit down and knit Socks to sell but I have not so much ambition about work as I used to have\n Mr C. is about as usual does some work but complains a great deal I think he shant live through the winter I think he would be too low spirited sometimes if I did not often tell him how much we have to be thankful for. there has been no Death nor any severe Sickness in our house for more tjam 43 years I think it remarkable. Harvey's health is not good but he works most of the time Hannah is much better than she was last winter She works very hard and would if she had but one to work for and two to help her. Henry has not been well for most a year has a pain in his bowels and back has a relax often. he is now taking some vegetable medicine that Joseph Draper sent him from Greenfield I think he is some better but has not much courage.

something about them from the paper it seems there never was such a time before I am afraid a great many that have to work for a living will suffer this winter if it is as cold as the two last winters

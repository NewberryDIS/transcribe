# Quick tips

- **Type what you see**, including misspellings, abbreviations, etc.

- Disregard formatting, with one exception: **add a single line break after each paragraph** (i.e. press "enter" at the end of the paragraph). This makes the final transcription more readable in our digital collections website.

- If a word is unclear, transcribe as much as possible. **Use [[?]] to represent illegible words or parts of words**, e.g. "th[[?]]" or "this is [[?]]"

- The **goal is to make a searchable transcription** that accurately represents the original text but is as readable as possible. If you're not sure how to transcribe something, think about what best meets those two ideals.

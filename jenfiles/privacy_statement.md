The transcriptions you work on will be made public and accessible -- that's the point of the project!  But, other than that, we store as little information about you as possible.  If you want to sign up for an account, we will store your username and password, and, if you choose to provide an email, we will store it.  We will not sell your information; we will do absolutely nothing with any of your data, except, as noted, the transcriptions themselves.

We use a third party service to store all of our data -- including user data.  However, that third party (Supabase) will not have access to any of your personal data.  Supabase is a trusted industry leader in cloud storage, and are unique in that their code is fully open source.

- You do not need to provide a real email address.  You will not be asked to verify your email address; ut is only used to help you regain access to your account if you lose your password.

- We like to feature particularly beautiful pages that have been transcribed on the home page of Newberry Transcribe.  Hopefully you saw an example of this when you first arrived.  We will attribute the transcription to you, using your username.  
  - If you do NOT wish to have your username associated with your contributions, you will find a checkbox on your user page marked "attribute anonymously" for that purpose.  There is no guarantee that any page will be featured; we have no process for this; it's all vibes.  
  - If you come across a page that you think would be nice to feature, please let us know using our contact email: dis@newberry.org.  The email is also found in the header "Contact" link.  Again, no guarantees -- there are many cooks in that kitchen.

whole buggy well painted. 
It is fortunate that no one was hurt when the carriage springs were broken.  It is a good thing to have quiet horses for family use.  Dr. Jones was not here either yesterday or the day before and he's not been here yet to-day. Charley had another good nights rest and is still more quiet and better today than heretofore. I presume the Dr. can do very little good in coming to see him - time care and to rest is what Charley needs more than medicine.  
Mr. [[unclear]] put the iron bars on the outside of the attic windows yesterday - there are 4 bars across each window and securely fastened to the window frames. They are painted green like the shutters and can hardly be noticed either from the inside or outside. It is very possible that this is also a good thing to have these bars on for the greater security of children who when playing there [[unclear]] the attic sooner if any time hereafter, might [[unclear]] into their glass [[unclear]] to get unto this [[unclear]] which would [[unclear]] dangerous [[unclear]]
Will write again to-morrow

is along with truths and enquiries about you.
Now Em I suppose that you of course expect to know what the fashions are in this ere town as a return for this information which you tendered me on this same point. Well, commencing at the head -- as you know it is easier to climb down hills than up -- hats are of sundry shapes and sizes [drawing of large and small hats] thus. I suppose you will like pictures best, as little girls generally do so I will give them to you. Hair and whiskers [drawing of a man's face with long hair and beard] thus. Collars entirely defunct. Shirts [drawing of striped shirt] boots and pants [drawing of a part of pants tucked into boots] thus. Walking sticks thus [drawing of a pick and a shovel]. Batchelors hall [drawing of men outside tent]. A dash out on the avenue [drawing of man in buggy]
But my genius is entirely exhausted so I must stop. All remarks will of course be unnecessary as a single glance will show you that they are not only unique in every point - but every thing this man of fashion could ask for - I had liked to have forgot however to mention that the above, are generally covered with a coat of dust varying from 3 feet in thickness (whew -- give me a whisk broom).
As to the ladies I believe that I have seen but one, and she was at such a distance that with out Hershals Telescope I should have hardly have been able to describe her to you

(71 I made Jack Foster's acquaintance when I first arrived, but he has been away a good deal. He is very homely, & wears shockingly old fashioned clothes, checked pantaloons for instance. On the other hand, his blood is blue, his connections splendid, his manners excellent; he is polite [drawing of a woman in striped dress and apron] kind, attentive, jolly, amusing, & 23. What is more, he has never said or done anything that jarred me in the least. We had a very nice time together at the table curse [course], & he was very attentive. After that I saw him occasionally, & about three weeks ago, he made me a present of a beautiful

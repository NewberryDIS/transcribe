I find that you have hit the same vein that makes Burns loved by the whole world--home scenes and home people are depicted so we fail not to recognize them. I rather like the conceit of Major Porter, and his party--it possessed the virtue of differing from my home village where there are ten girls to each young man. Then too what a good time \"Tim\" had at the Exposition with Uncle Bill's boys and the Peruvians, both male and female. That scene where the candy maker \"dreamily whipping\" a rope of candy which would not have been a bit too big for one boy. I was always fascinated by a candy maker at our county fair, and I have often stood on Euclid avenue, Cleveland, opposite the Soldiers Monument, watching a candy puller. He is gone now and so has the little two story shop and a sky scraper has taken its place. In the retail past there was a pretty Annie, who did up candy and served ice cream to the young men and old ones too, for I will be 74 on \"Sat. Sept.\" 1, 1906.--and to the Mrs. LaGranges. I go back to the \"Chatterbox\" as my first love, and always get relief from care a pleasure in it. I have for a long time wanted to thank you for giving the world the sketches you have, and I heartily do so nowSincerely yours JHowellsMiss? Edith WyattChicago (?)H",

Because at the date the commission of investigation appointed by the Gov. has not yet began its investigation and, safe a riprive, we shall be executed within less than three weeks: how could be possible to study thoroughly, [closely?] and wholly, in less than three weeks, a case that lasted seven years of legal procedures, with two trials which lasted, globally, over ten weeks, and with seven voluminous appeals?",

I think of you every day (N.B. & sometimes twice) but I am a bum little writer as you know. I saw Sarah a few minutes on her way east buthave not seen her since, she promised to let me know on her return - but have not heard from her. If it page torn I will try to get her on the subjectyou mention and ? I can.  I am sorry for all of them but I guess more for Mr Wood than the others. His case is so helpless & he is so torn by conflicting interestsWhat can one do with his family ties    Imagine little Margarette tugging at your heart strings. Life is horribly cruel and the trouble is there is no way out of anything.Except out of life & no one has the nerve to take the sure road. I know for I have tried to take it. On the whole it seems as if Sarah should fight it out. It cant be changedbut this doesnt mean that it is not hard for her it is.  Think of all the fool rainbows and baubles that are held up to us to lure us on. We know all about but still we thinkthat we will find the pot of gold and chase & chase until we plunge headlong into the open grave.

Have a number of interesting things and am so busy I don't get a chance to think about myself very much. Which is good. I am to go to N.Y. the last of the month to debate with Scott Nearing - the poor simp - on the question \"Is there a law of progress in the universe\" - which there aint.  I debated with him a year ago on Optimism and pessimism he was very serious and earnest - like life.  I did nothing but poke fun at him and the Optimists.   I would hate to be so damned serious a a serious wounded Optimist - O yes here is one I got off to Zona Gale the other day its good isnt it.  \"The man is a belligerent as a non resistant.\"  any how she laughed - being one   And Sunday I am to debate here with Prof Case on \"Has the Human Race got through\" - which it has and I can prove it biologically - phylosophically historically and every old way.  am interested that you are turning to religion or at least turning ? to ?",

He came in the Monday Morning & told me he had been to the Episcopalian church the day before.  I asked him if an agnostic like him wasnt ashamed to go to church.  He allowed it was better for his business to go ? a while, and then I said, why the Episcopalian.  He replied as follows.  When I was a boy I got a job at ? a RR through Wyoming the hotels in the little country cross roads were vile  Mostly dust & flies & liquid butter etc. etc.  He finally went down to the camp and got some canned corn, canned beef, canned beans etc. etc.  and took them to his room and boarded out of cans.

This being sowhat safeguards are best to throw around the business It is a menace to men & women both where any one inthis occupation spreading disease - for instance a mangets an occupational disease- his wife gets it - thepreacher gets it most any one gets it.

It was such a glorious warm bright day, the trees were so green, the grass & the flowers; I had left it before so many times & yet I felt as badly as if it had been the first going away; They all laughed & told me not to waste any sentiment as I should be back in a year or two, & now, was my sentiment wasted? The house was so beautiful in itself, & it was home; & now I have no home anywhere; if I had always lived there it would not be so bad, but for years I have looked forward to going back there, & now I have nothing to look forward to. - Papa bought the land, Papa built the house, Papa planted the trees, Papa lived there, & now what is there left in the wide world of association with him? nothing, his picture his letters all are burnt away. Why is it so? The last seven months of his life are almost unknown to us, he died far away from us in mid ocean with no one to care for him when he needed it utterly, no one to learn his last wishes, no one to love him; & now with all that the few traces of him are swept away for ever.",

Sully at Sioux City april 1863.\nI wish to have the reader remember, those troops suffered more, I dare say, than any in the U.S. service! especially the 6th for this Regt. was the only full Regt. staid with \"Sully\" in his 3 E'p'ditions, for want of food, especially potatoes unions and like vegetables. Men suffered terribly with scurvy and our company had often, one half sick from it; some died! then the monotony of those long Dakota winters, hundreds of miles from civilization, in those filthy log barracks; 2 of my Co. shot themselves!\nI recall those matters for the people of the country never can appreciate the work of this Regt. in those years.\nMartin J.

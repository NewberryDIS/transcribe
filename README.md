This is a copy of the code, but the (primary repo is on GitLab](<https://gitlab.com/newberry-library/transcribe>). We find that, as an organization, our ethical standards align more closely with GitLab. We understand that Microsoft's continued industry dominance won't by impacted by our choice, but neither do we need to allow our reputation to be modified by proximity to theirs.

You are welcome to use the code herein, but please note that this copy of the code may be out of date. Check the date on the GitLab repo's most recent commit. Feel free to let us know if you would like us to update this copy.

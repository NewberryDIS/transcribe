The water is of a most beautiful blue and exceedingly cold.  The guide of the sailors at night is to draw up a bucket full and tests its temperature by the hand.  If cold they are in the gulf - if warm they are not.\nI have read of the blue ocean - its tinted waters but have not believed half the stories - attributing much to the imagination of voyagers.  Water looks blue in the distance - but to have it of the most beautiful blue around you - near you and under you had not entered into my conceptions.  The little waves in a particular position reflect a most exquisite tint - a deep and delicate blue - vying seemingly with beautiful blue of the ocean overhead.  The water looked as if coloured with indigo - and I could not but help imagining how well it answer the washerwomen as rinse-water.  They would rejoice in so vast and inexhaustible a supply.\nBut there is another beauty in the Gulf Stream - and that is its foam as created by the paddles of the ship.  Milk in its purist state is not whiter or clearer - its sparkles and rolls over the blue underwater in beautiful contrast.  This exceeding whiteness is owing in part to the blueness of the water - but mostly I think to the phosphorous contained in the sea-water.  Indeed this peculiarity of the salt water strikes the observer most forcibly - its phosphorescence.\nI stood last night - leaning over the bulwarks - after the other passengers had deserted the deck - watching this beautiful appearance of the sea.  Its development consists mostly in sparks of globules of light, as the water is disturbed - but the illumination is more general - when the bow sends a line of foam - dashing from the side.\nFrom the stern - as the water was thrown up by the whirls - it seemed as if millions of pearls were shining in the deep.

The method of carting first struck my attention.  The carts are small and the platform extends beyond in over the wheels.  The jacks being small also - gave the whole the appearance of boys play more than anything else.  Nevertheless the loads were large considering the nature of the establishment.\nThe next thing was the negroes themselves.  For colour they exceeded all artificial black - and then dress was simply a pair of trousers light at the waist.  There were no half bloods nothing less than the real Congo.  Their persons thus exposed to the sun and air - no doubt was cooler show if covered yet I thought the direct rays of the sun must have effect.  The perspiration rolling down - made their backs shine like glass bottles.\nPassing several corners - we came into a square in which was a small park.  There was a fountain at the side of the street - and over the wall a garden - rich in tropical trees.  There was my first sight of the Cabbage tree - which grows up very tall - the trunk is barrell form - and the foliage is a tuft at the top - the faruit a small berry growing like the grape.  Here also was my first sight of the plantain  It resembles much our swamp ferns - only of gigantic size.\nWe went into a little farther and entered a very Celebrated Cafe called La Dominican.

There alas is a beautiful Plaza - intersected with winding roads - and it is the favourite resort of the ladies in the afternoon.  The ladies here never walk - this being considered indelicate - but they have a peculiar looking vehicle called the Volante - in which they do their shopping - visiting - and take their airings.  It is drawn by a mule or horse - which is ridden by a negro.  No phills an about 16 foot long - this with the spring which sustains the seat makes it one of the easiest of carriages.  The negroes manage their volantes very adsoitly - such a long tail behind would comprise a Yankee driver - as it is by no means certain that places and corners - which are accessable to the jackass - and so to the carriage.  Another thing which makes calculation in turning neccessary is the exceeding narrowness of the streets.  These volantes can only pass by an inch or two - and the least varying would cause them to come in contact - as for turning round that is impossible.  I suppose the final cause of making the streets so narrow is - to give the inhabitants always a go ahead habit.\nThe ladies never leave their carriage to shop.

It is a circular form - and above the mason work earth making green surround - over the top of the fort.  The huge cannon lay on the embankment - with their mouths open towards us.  The grounds around are well arranged - and covered with the green grass look very agreeable.  Near the fort and parting the water are the barracks - a large though old fashioned building.  Nearly opposite stands a smaller fort - and these two are the Ceibesus of the river.\nThe water was very high - having overflowed the banks.  I saw shrubs - and fences - stood up out of the water - and houses were surrounded or inundated.  It was like the swellings of Jordan.\nThe Levy - which now is applied to several objects - belongs property to the embankment - which keeps the river within bounds.  On the Mississippi - more especially the part we saw - this mound is small - it runs along both banks and extends some 600 miles.

This nut is very fine flavored - the most palatable of all kinds - only one caution is to be observed in eating - to avoid any of the shell - as this is acrid.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":93060,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/93060","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/5c06021967e60269670c92ab0ed7a3e9.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/5c06021967e60269670c92ab0ed7a3e9.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/5c06021967e60269670c92ab0ed7a3e9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5c06021967e60269670c92ab0ed7a3e9.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-10T22:43:36+00:00","modified":"2020-05-29T19:44:23+00:00","filename":"5c06021967e60269670c92ab0ed7a3e9.jpg","authentication":"fc5c92eabe8faaeb3ff858e57382a0fb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3139_00023_o2.jpg","size":857293,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1843,"resolution_y":2222,"compression_ratio":0.069781232057009}},"item":{"id":1206,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1206","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"38.\nSunday march 18th 1849.\nAn April Day - Sun shone brightly part of the time and showers part of the time.  This was the first rain experienced on our passage.  The Lightning and Thunder the first have heard this season.  It seemed strange so early.  They tell me at Chagres there is a great deal of this commodity\nWe are sailing up the Mississippi - this Father of Rivers.  It is not very wide - but to make amends is rainaying deep.  The water is muddy - and heavy.  It is never far from soil.  It is very soft and pleasant to drink - when cleaned ahem it is splendid drinking water.  'Tis said it keeps longer at sea than any other.\nThe banks at the entrance are low - and swampy:  looks very uninviting.  New Orleans is situated about 110 miles up so that we had one all day job before us.  The several mouths of the river are called \"bayous\" (pronounced - bi,ose) - a little distance up in the Pilots Station - a place of 36 or 40 houses.  There we changed our bar pilot and took on a river one\nFrom its low and wet situation we thought it must be very unhealthy.  Some one asked the Clerk whether it was so.  \"I dont know\" he replied - \"they drink so much rum it cant be determined!\"\nThe country some 25 miles up began to assume a pleasenter aspect. The hills advanced nearer and the level looked drier and more capable of cultivation.  Saw many little hovels - belonging I presume to fishermen or poor people - a little patch of a garden - a little strip of fence - completed the residence.  There were county seats undoubtedly.\nSaw a beautiful flock of swans.  There were floating upon the water.  Their white necks curved gracefully.  It reminded me of Percivals Silver Lake\n\"Oh thy fair bosom Silver Lake\nThe wild swan spreads his snowy sail\nAnd sound his breast the ripples break\nAs down he bears before the gale.\"","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":93061,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/93061","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/9cce42d6ba43d3f431d77b472b60dbf7.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/9cce42d6ba43d3f431d77b472b60dbf7.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/9cce42d6ba43d3f431d77b472b60dbf7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9cce42d6ba43d3f431d77b472b60dbf7.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-10T22:43:37+00:00","modified":"2020-05-19T19:42:24+00:00","filename":"9cce42d6ba43d3f431d77b472b60dbf7.jpg","authentication":"e443abca6d5b0b5e602c5a7f747c6760","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3139_00024r_o2.jpg","size":925539,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1823,"resolution_y":2222,"compression_ratio":0.076162772612972}},"item":{"id":1206,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1206","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":93062,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/93062","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/ffbe3ea5180c4c2a8f7dd90d9ef64952.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/ffbe3ea5180c4c2a8f7dd90d9ef64952.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/ffbe3ea5180c4c2a8f7dd90d9ef64952.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ffbe3ea5180c4c2a8f7dd90d9ef64952.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-10T22:43:38+00:00","modified":"2020-05-30T18:24:31+00:00","filename":"ffbe3ea5180c4c2a8f7dd90d9ef64952.jpg","authentication":"515fc793dd778a755a2fcbcd9e2bbd40","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3139_00024_o2.jpg","size":911811,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1843,"resolution_y":2222,"compression_ratio":0.074218843479573}},"item":{"id":1206,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1206","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"40.  \nThe Live Oak grows here too.  This singular wood - so peculiar in its properties is well adapted to ship building.  Unlike other oaks it does not grow very high - so that it is difficult to get long sticks of it.  I was much surprised to see how small and stunted it was.  The longest sticks seldom exceed 39 or 40 feet.\nI noticed a great deal of dry moss hanging from the branches of the live oak.  This was the Spanish Beard or Moss used for mattresses &c -.\nOn the dead trees - green and flourishing hung the misseltoe - famous in song - and ancient Christmas times.  There is much poetry in the misseltoe I know not why.  Evergreens were plenty.\nIn the wet and low places grows the palmetto - from which is made our palm leaf fans.  It looks like a fan when growing - back leaf diverging from the root as from a center.  It is a small shrub - like the Calamus or the Cat-o-ninitails.\nAbout 50 miles from the mouth of the river we began to reach the plantations.  And the scenery began to assume a more interesting aspect.  We watched then plantations with curiosity for this was the first time many of us were ever in a slave country.\nThe plantations many of them were very fine - house - and buildings very fine and comfortable.  The Sugar House and Negro huts are mostly together the dwelling of the owner - by itself.  We could see the long shells of cane as we passed - it was the howing time.  The cane is planted only on a in three or four years - the rest of the time it springs from the old roots.\nThe Negro house - looked comfortable.  They are one story - with stoop along the front and generally stand oppossite - a little street running down between them to the water.\nRegard is paid by planters in building their habitations - to the circulation of air and protection from the sun.  Also to high winds and hurricanes which sometimes visit them.  The buildings therefore are low and spaced out.

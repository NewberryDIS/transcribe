21 1866\nElyria, Monday, May 21\n1866\nStLouis\nMy dear Isaac,\nI have had two letters from you to day. One which came to me this morning I suppose must have come Saturday night but I did not hear from the office. It simply told of your safe arrival at St Louis, and of the strawberries.\nBut to night came a nice long account of your place and your ministers and your impression of the progress of St Louis. during the last fifteen years I think you must rather enjoy noting the change comparing \"now and then\" as well as meeting some old acquaintances.\nI felt a little sorry to have gon away so long; but it will doubtless turn out? all for the best.

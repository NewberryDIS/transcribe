Their only difficulty or loss,\ntherefore, was in the element they had braved\nwith so much temerity, whereby a man was drowned,\nand the lives of others were greatly endangered, but for\nthe timely assistance of Mexican citizens themselves,\nwho were active in extracting them from the water.\nBut the adventurous Colonel had hardly begun\nto enjoy his conquest, when an order reached him from Gen.

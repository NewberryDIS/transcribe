The 10-man expedition leaves Santa Fe on July 29, 1776, hoping to open an overland route from New Mexico to Monterey. Because of Hopi resistance and hostile Apaches to the west, Escalante and Dom\u00ednguez take a route used by New Mexico traders northward to Colorado and the San Juan River, past Mesa Verde, the Dolores and Gunnison Rivers, northwest to the Green River, and finally turning west to reach Utah Lake near Provo on September 23. Hampered by difficult terrain and severe weather, the explorers decide on October 8 not to continue on to Monterey, but instead to head south to the Colorado River, which they cross on November 8 at La Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n on the Utah-Arizona border, near Glen Canyon, now submerged beneath Lake Powell. The trail east takes them home through Oraibi and Zuni, and they reach Santa Fe on January 3, 1777. Throughout his diary, Escalante describes the geography, plants and animals of the area, and includes his observations on the manners and customs of the Indians they encounter, such as the Lagunas, the bearded Utes, and the Huascari. <a href=\"https:\/\/webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu\/nby\/cgi-bin\/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=122759\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View catalog record<\/a>","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":41,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/41","name":"Description","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/939e8c28a63c997f55c3db3c855df43f.jpg","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":48,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/48","name":"Source","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Observations on geography, plants and animals, and Indian encounters during a journey from New Mexico to Utah Lake","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":46,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/46","name":"Relation","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Spanish","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":44,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/44","name":"Language","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1229","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":43,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/43","name":"Identifier","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}

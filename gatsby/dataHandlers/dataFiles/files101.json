Wonder if you realize it. Last week Tuesday J. Eddie came here and remained over night. The next day he and cousin M. came up to Remsen and Saturday evening we all came down together, John Eddie going right on to Clinton. I do not think we would or could have got away from home without their help. The weather was very mild and pleasant all the week and only after we were safe within cousin M's comfortable home was there a change. Before John Eddie reached Clinton it began to rain. We had a letter from him this a.m. He says the rain stopped before he reached the top of the hill. there wa some hail and we think he did not get very wet, altho'\nfrom you soon and I am sorry we could not have sent you a box of goodies from home. Cousin M. brought us some nice sweet oranges and bananas of which we partook unsparingly and enjoyed hugely all through her visit with us. We also made much of John's? present. Gave Mrs. P. 7 lemons which were left when we came away. She was very much pleased to get them.

He gives them shelled corn cooked in milk or water - 4 pails full I think twice a day - corn on the cobs, milk, rotten apples, kitchen slops etc. John puts 1\/2 a cup of thick cream, every morning when he skims, for Mary. Her stomach has not encouraged her to eat it the last two days so I kept it for her - but when it got sour first day?  I ate it. Today I put it in the Jonny cake! You ought to have a piece!

The first journal, from 1851, describes the death of a family member, Aldric, who had gone to California (possibly Mrs. Rowley’s husband).

The family was living in Brooklyn, New York, when Isaac decided to move them to the Middle West, where his sister Abigail and her husband Charles Cleveland were already settled. In 1841 and 1842, teenager Mary Sackett kept a lively, detailed journal of the journey from New York City to Laona, a small town in Winnebago County, Illinois. In 1847, when Mary Sackett was twenty-one, she married Hanson C. Pierson, who died a year later. In 1852 she married Samuel Chapman with whom she had six children. Little else is known about Sackett’s adult life, and she died at age forty-three in 1869.

We ate dinner with him and then Helen and I looked around in the stores for the few things we wanted to buy. We ate supper with the Wilcox's and are fixed up for the night in a good hotel. I have come down to the journal office to spend a few minutes with Howard who has had some writing to do and now we are both going back to the hotel for a little visit with his mother. Howard is writing this for me at my dictation and is a very rapid writer\nWe had a pleasant journey. Edward and I enjoyed it very much, but the others got rather tired.\nBryan speaks here tomorrow night, but I fear that we will not be able to remain to hear him.\nHoward sends his love with mine, and will write in a few days.\nMost Affectionately Your Nephew,\nJE.

He graduated from Wrexham Seminary in 1815, and soon after was ordained a minister with the Congregationalists at Capel Lôn Swan, Denbigh. During this time Everett learned a system of shorthand writing, which he adapted to the Welsh language and continued to use throughout his life. While at Denbigh he wrote an instructional book of this shorthand writing, as well as a Sunday school catechism first published in 1822. He married Elizabeth Roberts, of Denbigh, in 1816, and the couple emigrated to America in 1823 when Everett accepted a call to the Welsh Congregational Church of Utica, NY. He remained in Utica nine years, then moved south to Winfield to become pastor of the Congregational Church there, and also spent a short time as pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Westernville. In 1838 he settled in Steuben, near Remsen, NY, where he took charge of the two Welsh chapels there, Capel Ucha and Penymynydd. Everett continued as pastor in Steuben until his death in 1875. Included here are sermons delivered between 1800 and 1860. Note that the early sermons were most likely not written by Everett, but probably revised and delivered by him. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Everett.xml#sum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

He leaves this city the last of this month, and will be in Washington the 1st of December, when the session commences. Mr. Leavitt, we are informed, does not go; Mr. C. will probably be the only man on whom the Liberty Party can rely for an exposition of the doings of that body.\nShall they make the most of his mission? That they may do so, we have at a great expense and risk enlarged the Patriot, so that in size it surpasses any paper, political or religious, published for any party or any sect in the State of New-York, west of New-York city. This has been done that Mr. C. may have full scope for his observations in its columns, and its readers at the same time be furnished with the doings of the State Legislature, while local and general news, as well as miscellaneous reading, can be also given in abundance, without interfering with its leading object, the advocacy of Liberty Principles. To meet the outlay, and to scatter wide into every district of this State the reports which Mr. C. will make weekly, we want TWO THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS FOR THE SESSION, at a DOLLAR EACH. The session will hold at least seven months, probably longer. Whatever its term be, six months or eight - it will not fall under or go over these - we will take subscribers at a Dollar each, more or less, at one Post-Office - cash invariably in advance.\nLiberty men well know how dark and mysterious to them were the District of Columbia and the Halls of Congress, till Joshua Leavitt first bearded the Slave Power in its den, and seated himself as a Sentinel for Freedom under its terrible gaze. Since that day, how much light and knowledge have come to us! Of all the instrumentalities we have ever used, no one has been more invaluable than that of maintaining a Reporter at Washington. At this time of day, when the conflict thickens, when Freedom lifts her head up cheerily, when Slavery hears the humming of \"the people's voice,\" as it gathers to the rescue of the Constitution and the Country, shall Liberty men, for want of spirit and self-denial, allow to ebb the flood tide which bears to victory those who trust to its bosom? Never! no, never!\nWell, then, my good friend, out of two hundred picked men, you are one of whom we ask the labor and toil of sending us ten subscribers for the session. Will you do it? Will you try? If you try and cannot get ten, get what you can and send them on. Whether one or twenty, the price is a Dollar a copy. But we rely on you for ten copies at least. Come, comrade, brush up your armor, and in the strength and faith of a true heart, devote yourself to this work for a day or two, and send us the results. What you do, should not be delayed. Your list ought to be entered so as to commence with the session, and that is at hand. You can as well do it now as by and by, and a little better.\nOne word more. In your efforts, do not apply to Liberty men alone to subscribe. Try others. You will with much less difficulty than you imagine, obtain men who will take the Patriot. Remember, also, that the Press is to be our lever. By it we must conquer. Let us hear from you soon. Do not delay the application, as the interest will be much increased by commencing with the session.\nRespectfully and truly yours,\nJ. C. JACKSON.\nAlbany, Nov. 20, 1845.",

I had forgotten - you are a little older than I thought but with the blessing of Heaven we hope you may yet be long spared to us.  I fear you have both too much care and labour. You ought to be careful. I fear you are wearing out too rapidly. We are all growing old, and in the course of nature we are passing away, but it saddens me to think that the time may come when I may see you no more in the flesh. This has seemed a more vivid and certain reality since our family circle has been broken by death. My debt of gratitude to you, my dear parents, I can never repay, but I have many and sad ...\n[Marginalia: Please tell us when you write about your donation how much etc. I feel relieved about John. Hope they will get along comfortably through the winter. Wish they would write to us. Hope they will soon.  We all write in love to you all. Yours as ever Elisabeth Butler]",

Printing, education, pioneer life, and religion are all discussed within the letters. Included are the papers of Robert Everett, the pastor of Welsh Congregationalist churches in Oneida County, New York, and publisher of Y Cenhadwr Americanaidd (The American Missionary), a Welsh religious reform magazine that was pro-abolition. Also included are letters and materials of Mary Everett, a graduate of New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, who was also involved in the suffrage movement, John Roberts and Sarah Colgrove Everett, pioneers who moved to Kansas Territory in 1854 and were active in abolitionist activities, and Cynthia Everett, a member of the American Missionary Association who taught freedmen in Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina, following the Civil War. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Everett.xml#series2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<br /><br /></a> Edward Williams Everett (1843-1920) was the youngest of the 11 Everett children. He lived in Turin, NY, where he married Mary Allen in 1869. The couple had four sons, Jay Carroll, Charles, Robert, and Edward. In 1885 the family moved to Olpe, KS, south of Emporia, where Edward opened a general store near the home of his brother John Roberts Everett. He also served as postmaster at Olpe, from 1893 until 1897. Two more sons, Ray and Harry, were born in Kansas.

Sister Abby and I are having a holiday today, and met at Home.\nThe news we received of the death of Mrs. Kendall called forth for you our deepest sympathy, which we gladly would have expressed, had not we felt your grief was too deep for unclear.  And since then we have experienced the truth of this.  Our Loved sister unclear, my brother Chandler's wife, was summoned home in August.  And on the morning of the 4th, she cheerfully smiled a Last Farewell and as we hope and  trust, joined the angel band in Heaven.  How happy the thoughts, that the friends we loved so dearly n Earth, are bright angels in Heaven!  Oh!  That I may so live that when Life is done I may join them there.  \nMr. Kendall you sustain a severe loss in the death of your dear wife.  How true it is that \"Life will not prove all sunshine.\"  Did you ever wonder why under the weight of unclear we must on our journey go?

Included are the couple's courtship letters as well as correspondence during later separations when one or the other of them was traveling, and a collection of their small diaries. There is correspondence and a few transcriptions of the narration of Charles Reed (Abby J. Reed's brother) concerning his 1849 overland journey to California and his subsequent adventures with the Washington City and California Mining Association, his prospecting on the Feather River and near Downieville, and his 1854 survival of a shipwreck off the California coast. News of close friends who took the Panama route to California is also included in the correspondence of Agnes Allen.

Then of his own minestry, his joys, and sorrows, and he seemed very much affected but went thro' bravely - he also spoke in connection of old Doct Medad Pomeroy and related some amusing incidents - The sermon will probably be printed and I presume you will see a copy - then followed a closing prayer by Old Rev. Mr. Harding - After that my Farewell Hymn read from the pulpit by Rev. Mr Lincoln announcing the authoress as before and sung by the choir splendidly to the music of \"Marcia\" commencing \"If on a quiet sea\" &c then the Benediction by Rev Mr. Smith. The procession commenced forming immediately headed by the President and Chief Marshall followed by Mr and Mrs Smith then the other ministers x wives invited guests &c. I was one of the committee on the tables in the vestry, so I ran down stairs to get in to the vestry first - but just as I got down I met Mr & Mrs Smith at the church door and Mr. Smith grasped my hand and said \"My dear Mary Anne (you know they used to call me so when I was a child) I feel as if I most want to kiss you !\" \"Well you may\" I replied, so he bent down his aged head and gave me a real nice kiss there right before the whole - and Mrs. Smith also, and I felt that those Kisses repaid me for all my efforts for their pleasant reception. When I think of it in the future you know. The tables in the vestry were bountifully supplied with nice eatables and adorned with boquets of flowers - my silver cake basket filled with every variety of cake, and my large glass preserve dish filled with peaches was on the table No. 1 for the ministers & invited guests. Hasnt it had an honorable dedication After the Collation we went back into the church for little extempore speeches and singing - and closed up with \"When shall we meet again\" and Old Hundred.

Negro suffrage in the South is a joke.\nNow the most optimistic supporter of prohibition frankly admits it is not enforced today, but is confident it will be enforced later. But is there anything to warrant such a conclusion. More than one half the adult population of the U.S. if left unrestrained would consume alcohol to some extent, hence do not want the law enforced. Only a small portion of the other half are willing to take any active part in enforcement, most men are much absorbed in their own affairs to spend any time or thought in the enforcement of a law that does not effect themselves directly. So we have the sad spectacle of a law flagrantly, and many times openly violated. What could be more destructive to good government.\nI think we can safely conclude that so long as the appetite exhists and the supply of grapes and sugar and yeast cake hold out, and every kitchen a brewery, Dame Nature will turn these ingredients into very good wine.

They also demonstrate the famous lawyer's concern and affection for his only child, Paul, who was living in Greeley as the manager of the Greeley Gas and Fuel Company. Subjects include the case of Stewart v. Ramsay; some allusions to Darrow's legal role in the Los Angeles bombing case and his bribery indictment; recommended reading and opinions on philosophical and psychological books; Darrow's desire to rent and/or own a cottage in Estes Park, Colorado; money and investments, and above all, Paul's welfare. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/JacobsDarrow.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View catalog guide</a>",

By 1912 she was singing important roles in Die Walkyrie in German, The Barber of Seville and The Jewels of the Madonna in Italian, and The Tales of Hoffmann in English. A native of Alsace-Lorraine, Dufau had arrived on the Chicago musical scene in 1910 following studies in Berlin, and almost immediately was successful with audiences. After 1916 she concentrated on a concert career, appearing at Ravinia and in Hamilton Park concert series, in Orchestra Hall and in Boston, among other places. In May, 1916, she sang with the silent film The Law Decides, which was one of the latest of entertainments called “Cinema Concerts.” In a 1917 recital at Orchestra Hall she sang La Marseillaise as apparently was the custom, followed by “an eclectic program” of Russian, Swedish and French songs, along with new songs written for her by Frank LaForge. Dufau’s name no longer appears in the Chicago papers after 1917, so presumably she returned to Europe at the end of the war.<br /><br />This collection consists almost entirely of letters written to Jenny Dufau by an Italian lover named Gaetano Riccuilli from September 1915, to April 1917, while Dufau was performing with the Chicago Grand Opera Company. Most of these letters concern his family or hers, the events of his daily life, the fact of their separation due to the war, and his many moods. Ricciulli apparently was an active service army officer on disability leave at the time of these letters.<br /><br />The principle historical interest of the letters lies in the many passing references to the war, especially to its disruption of civilian life in Italy, and to a lesser degree in France and Switzerland. There are repeated references to censorship, and the development of censorship is traceable by evidence on the envelopes. For a brief time after the start of censorship his letters become more circumspect, but they return to the passionate tone of the earlier ones fairly quickly. One letter speculates on the possibility that America may enter the war on the side of the Italian-French-English alliance. Except in a very general way, there is no information here on the progress of the war itself or of civilian morale, as these topics undoubtedly would have been censored. <a href=\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=808377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>\n<p></p>",

As several of her siblings moved westward into Wisconsin, she followed, and though she was trained to teach school she married Asa Hurd of Brandon, Wisconsin in 1859. The young Hurds bought land in Minnesota and attempted to become successful farmers.<br /><br />Augusta and Asa Hurd had one daughter born in 1862, whom they named Mary Olivia. Six and a half months later Asa joined the Union Army as a wagoner of Company E, 10th Minnesota Infantry and Augusta and her baby rejoined her sister in the more settled and stable town of Brandon, Wisconsin. Asa never returned from the war, having apparently been killed in April, 1865, outside Montgomery, Alabama, while foraging for his company, although there is some possibility he simply disappeared west as veterans sometimes did. Augusta never remarried. She supported herself and her daughter Mary by land speculation in Minnesota and South Dakota at a time when settlers were pouring into the Territories. She had the skill to buy and rent houses and land, while she also traveled back to Bainbridge New York to be with her father. When he died, Augusta became active in the Suffrage Movement.<br /><br />Mary Olivia Hurd married Daniel Clark Arno in 1884 and a long and difficult relationship began, as Mary Olivia’s letters to her mother reveal. Dan Arno was quick-tempered and sometimes abusive. He was a skilled carpenter and builder of houses, often away from home, leaving Mary to cope with the hardships of rural life and isolated motherhood in or near Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Mary followed her mother’s example of dealing in westward speculation, but a severe financial and agricultural depression kept profits low and farming was arduous. Mary’s letters to her mother between 1886 and 1897 refer to her longing to be near her, and in 1898 Ann Augusta Hurd permanently left New York and settled with her daughter in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, in a home built by her son-in-law, Dan Arno. Augusta Hurd died in 1921 and Mary Hurd Arno died in 1925.<br /><br />This collection is composed mainly of letters from Mary Olivia Hurd Arno to her mother, 1886-1897, with six letters of Augusta Jaquins Hurd to her father and brother, 1858-1866, and seventeen miscellaneous letters either to her or retained by her.<br /><br />Note: This collection has been published; see <em>The Letters of Ann Augusta Jaquins Hurd and Mary Olivia Hurd Arno, 1858-1897</em>, edited by Helen Hazen Cooperman (Chicago: Cooperman, 1988). <a href=\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=808762\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

I have known men in there offices who are skeptical as to the propriety or even posibility of civilizing the Ind's.  They are generally men of immoral habits & care for nothing further than to keep fair accounts with the Dept.  Nothing can be more obvious, than that men of benevolent views & feelings, who would enter upon the discharge of such duties under the full conviction of its propriety and importance as well as practicability, would succede to better advantage than those of other views & practices.\nWhite men of good character & qualifications for such stations, will nor forego the priviledges of civilized life, for such an office, unless they are actuated by benevolent motives toward, the Indians.  Hence the most of Ind. farmers have been of idle & dissolute habits; the Ind's. have become disgusted with them & the project for their improvement has proved a failure.  But there has not been an instance of failure, of the kind, however, where the men employed have been of pious as well as moral & industrious habits.

You say it was interpreted to all your Nations; & we presume it was fully understood.  We therein explicitly declared to you, that it was now impossible to make the river Ohio the boundary between your lands & the lands of the U. S.  Your answer amounts to a declaration that you will agree to no other boundary than the Ohio.  The negociation is therefore at an end.  We sincerely regret that peace [underline] is not the result, but knowing the upright & liberal views of the U. S., which as far as you gave us an opportunity, we have explained to you, we trust that impartial judges will not attribute the continuance of the war to them.\"\n    Done at Capt.

It contains descriptions of food shortages, wagon travel across mountain ranges, and gold rush Sacramento and San Francisco. The journal of the 1851 voyage from San Francisco to New York describes hardships of travel on the recently inaugurated Nicaragua route via San Juan and Greytown, and an Atlantic voyage plagued by an inexperienced captain, coal and food shortages, and a massive storm. Journals of the 1854 voyages to and from San Francisco describe the Isthmus of Panama route and an encounter with Santa Anna's fleet, which was blockading the Acapulco harbor. <a href=\"https://webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=141142\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View catalog record</a>",

And were you to lay aside all other feelings of a private or personal character, & duly appreciate my motives, great & lasting good may result in restoring brotherly confidence & harmony among ourselves. It has just occurred to me to suggest for the consideration of the most influential & prominent men, that a special meeting might be held by is to confer on points in relation to the affair of our much afflicted nation, and on which it has been so strenuously insisted by the officer of the general government hat we differ and from which they state that distinct parties have grown up among ourselves: If you will signify to me your willingness to accept an invitation to hold such a conference I will immediately advise with Mr. Lowrey & others and then fix on the time & place and approve you of the same. The conference should be purely Cherokee & composed of a chosen few selected for their wisdom & moral worth, and whose devotion to the best interest & welfare of the nation alone will influence their deliberation. \nI am, gentlemen, \nYour friend and fellow citizen\nJohn Ross\nMasin Ridge\nIllegible Ridge\nCherokee Agency.",

Also depression because it is too late to reprieve anything and not worth changing for the few remaining years of my life. Dr. merely corroborated my own opinion of myself (enforced by statement of abnormality) thereby adding to inferiority feeling.\nDr. told me I had never liked my mother. The inference is that my self-reproach at her death was due to this sub-conscious feeling. But\nself-reproach was merely for not being with her.

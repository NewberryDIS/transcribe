            "desc": "One of two journals kept by Mrs. Rowley about the city of Chicago and its environs. The first journal, from 1851, describes the death of a family member, Aldric, who had gone to California (possibly Mrs. Rowley’s husband). The second journal spans 1857-1887 and describes farming life, weather, multiple marriages and funerals, and family and social gatherings at home and at Hoards Hall, Unity Church, and camp meetings. Frequent trips to Chicago and other nearby towns including Leyden, Ridgeland, Harlem, and Maywood are described, along with an extended trip to Mrs. Rowley’s childhood home of Shelburn (now Shelburne), Vermont. As the journal progresses, Mrs. Rowley enters her 60s and 70s and begins to write repeatedly after family gatherings and holidays that the whole family may not be together for the next gathering. <br /><a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Rowley.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a> | <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/mms_096\">View in digital collection</a>"

The first journal, from 1851, describes the death of a family member, Aldric, who had gone to California (possibly Mrs. Rowley’s husband). The second journal spans 1857-1887 and describes farming life, weather, multiple marriages and funerals, and family and social gatherings at home and at Hoards Hall, Unity Church, and camp meetings. Frequent trips to Chicago and other nearby towns including Leyden, Ridgeland, Harlem, and Maywood are described, along with an extended trip to Mrs. Rowley’s childhood home of Shelburn (now Shelburne), Vermont. As the journal progresses, Mrs. Rowley enters her 60s and 70s and begins to write repeatedly after family gatherings and holidays that the whole family may not be together for the next gathering. <br /><a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Rowley.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a> | <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/mms_096\">View in digital collection</a>"

The family was living in Brooklyn, New York, when Isaac decided to move them to the Middle West, where his sister Abigail and her husband Charles Cleveland were already settled. In 1841 and 1842, teenager Mary Sackett kept a lively, detailed journal of the journey from New York City to Laona, a small town in Winnebago County, Illinois. In 1847, when Mary Sackett was twenty-one, she married Hanson C. Pierson, who died a year later. In 1852 she married Samuel Chapman with whom she had six children. Little else is known about Sackett’s adult life, and she died at age forty-three in 1869.

Do be careful not to expose yourself much during the hottest part of the day.  Sarah enjoys the warm weather, and gains strength I think, but still coughs a good deal.  Edward went away again Tuesday morn.  Mate and the boys & cousin [?] are here yet.  Jane has been quite sick for two or three days -- is some better this afternoon.

I have come down to the journal office to spend a few minutes with Howard who has had some writing to do and now we are both going back to the hotel for a little visit with his mother. Howard is writing this for me at my dictation and is a very rapid writer\nWe had a pleasant journey. Edward and I enjoyed it very much, but the others got rather tired.\nBryan speaks here tomorrow night, but I fear that we will not be able to remain to hear him.\nHoward sends his love with mine, and will write in a few days.\nMost Affectionately Your Nephew,\nJE.

While at Denbigh he wrote an instructional book of this shorthand writing, as well as a Sunday school catechism first published in 1822. He married Elizabeth Roberts, of Denbigh, in 1816, and the couple emigrated to America in 1823 when Everett accepted a call to the Welsh Congregational Church of Utica, NY. He remained in Utica nine years, then moved south to Winfield to become pastor of the Congregational Church there, and also spent a short time as pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Westernville. In 1838 he settled in Steuben, near Remsen, NY, where he took charge of the two Welsh chapels there, Capel Ucha and Penymynydd. Everett continued as pastor in Steuben until his death in 1875. Included here are sermons delivered between 1800 and 1860. Note that the early sermons were most likely not written by Everett, but probably revised and delivered by him. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Everett.xml#sum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>"

            "transcription": "CIRCULAR.\nDEAR SIR:\nWHO GOES TO WASHINGTON THIS WINTER AS A REPORTER FOR FREEDOM? is a question asked every day. I take the liberty to reply. W.L. CHAPLIN goes. He leaves this city the last of this month, and will be in Washington the 1st of December, when the session commences. Mr. Leavitt, we are informed, does not go; Mr. C. will probably be the only man on whom the Liberty Party can rely for an exposition of the doings of that body.\nShall they make the most of his mission? That they may do so, we have at a great expense and risk enlarged the Patriot, so that in size it surpasses any paper, political or religious, published for any party or any sect in the State of New-York, west of New-York city. This has been done that Mr. C. may have full scope for his observations in its columns, and its readers at the same time be furnished with the doings of the State Legislature, while local and general news, as well as miscellaneous reading, can be also given in abundance, without interfering with its leading object, the advocacy of Liberty Principles. To meet the outlay, and to scatter wide into every district of this State the reports which Mr. C. will make weekly, we want TWO THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS FOR THE SESSION, at a DOLLAR EACH. The session will hold at least seven months, probably longer. Whatever its term be, six months or eight - it will not fall under or go over these - we will take subscribers at a Dollar each, more or less, at one Post-Office - cash invariably in advance.\nLiberty men well know how dark and mysterious to them were the District of Columbia and the Halls of Congress, till Joshua Leavitt first bearded the Slave Power in its den, and seated himself as a Sentinel for Freedom under its terrible gaze. Since that day, how much light and knowledge have come to us! Of all the instrumentalities we have ever used, no one has been more invaluable than that of maintaining a Reporter at Washington. At this time of day, when the conflict thickens, when Freedom lifts her head up cheerily, when Slavery hears the humming of \"the people's voice,\" as it gathers to the rescue of the Constitution and the Country, shall Liberty men, for want of spirit and self-denial, allow to ebb the flood tide which bears to victory those who trust to its bosom? Never! no, never!\nWell, then, my good friend, out of two hundred picked men, you are one of whom we ask the labor and toil of sending us ten subscribers for the session. Will you do it? Will you try? If you try and cannot get ten, get what you can and send them on. Whether one or twenty, the price is a Dollar a copy. But we rely on you for ten copies at least. Come, comrade, brush up your armor, and in the strength and faith of a true heart, devote yourself to this work for a day or two, and send us the results. What you do, should not be delayed. Your list ought to be entered so as to commence with the session, and that is at hand. You can as well do it now as by and by, and a little better.\nOne word more. In your efforts, do not apply to Liberty men alone to subscribe. Try others. You will with much less difficulty than you imagine, obtain men who will take the Patriot. Remember, also, that the Press is to be our lever. By it we must conquer. Let us hear from you soon. Do not delay the application, as the interest will be much increased by commencing with the session.\nRespectfully and truly yours,\nJ. C. JACKSON.\nAlbany, Nov. 20, 1845.",

Then of his own minestry, his joys, and sorrows, and he seemed very much affected but went thro' bravely - he also spoke in connection of old Doct Medad Pomeroy and related some amusing incidents - The sermon will probably be printed and I presume you will see a copy - then followed a closing prayer by Old Rev. Mr. Harding - After that my Farewell Hymn read from the pulpit by Rev. Mr Lincoln announcing the authoress as before and sung by the choir splendidly to the music of \"Marcia\" commencing \"If on a quiet sea\" &c then the Benediction by Rev Mr. Smith. The procession commenced forming immediately headed by the President and Chief Marshall followed by Mr and Mrs Smith then the other ministers x wives invited guests &c. I was one of the committee on the tables in the vestry, so I ran down stairs to get in to the vestry first - but just as I got down I met Mr & Mrs Smith at the church door and Mr. Smith grasped my hand and said \"My dear Mary Anne (you know they used to call me so when I was a child) I feel as if I most want to kiss you !\" \"Well you may\" I replied, so he bent down his aged head and gave me a real nice kiss there right before the whole - and Mrs. Smith also, and I felt that those Kisses repaid me for all my efforts for their pleasant reception. When I think of it in the future you know. The tables in the vestry were bountifully supplied with nice eatables and adorned with boquets of flowers - my silver cake basket filled with every variety of cake, and my large glass preserve dish filled with peaches was on the table No. 1 for the ministers & invited guests. Hasnt it had an honorable dedication After the Collation we went back into the church for little extempore speeches and singing - and closed up with \"When shall we meet again\" and Old Hundred. Mr Smith said he never felt so near heaven as on that day and we all thought - amen - Now I've only one line more to tell you that we are all well as usual Rhoda has a bad cold - Samuel & Maria have a little infant daughter a week old. Good - night with love from sister Mary, written down left hand side of page Monday Evening - James Blake and wife and Mary Smith and Adam have just gone - They have been visiting here this afternoon and evening I told them to stop and see you on their way home and they thought they would like to - They go next December or January - Samuel Blake visited us last Thursday Mrs Mayo and Ann called this afternoon and Mrs J Goldsbury Mr. D. Douglass Elizabeth Hatch's husband preached in our church yesterday forenoon - Mrs Windom is yet in town - Doct Taylor and his wife were both at our Anniversary Festival they got unclear carriage and sent for them ! the first time the Doct has rode out",

Also included are the draft of an address to be delivered to the American Institute on the subject of the appropriate disposition of the funds given to establish the Smithsonian Institution, as well as eleven letters from William Barlow the younger, to his wife, Matilda Richards Barlow, 1842-1851. Barlow, unemployed at the time of the bulk of the correspondence, apparently had tuberculosis.

Negro suffrage in the South is a joke.\nNow the most optimistic supporter of prohibition frankly admits it is not enforced today, but is confident it will be enforced later. But is there anything to warrant such a conclusion. More than one half the adult population of the U.S. if left unrestrained would consume alcohol to some extent, hence do not want the law enforced. Only a small portion of the other half are willing to take any active part in enforcement, most men are much absorbed in their own affairs to spend any time or thought in the enforcement of a law that does not effect themselves directly. So we have the sad spectacle of a law flagrantly, and many times openly violated. What could be more destructive to good government.\nI think we can safely conclude that so long as the appetite exhists and the supply of grapes and sugar and yeast cake hold out, and every kitchen a brewery, Dame Nature will turn these ingredients into very good wine. And if anyone wants a stronger kick the omnipresent bootlegs with his ways that are dark and tricks that are vain can supply him.",

His father was a well-known abolitionist who was later nominated as the first vice presidential candidate for the Liberty Party. In 1876, Francis J. LeMoyne erected the first crematorium in the United States near Washington, Pennsylvania. John LeMoyne studied law in Pittsburgh and was admitted to the bar in 1852. That same year he toured the West, deciding to moved to Chicago and begin his law practice. He married with his wife, Julia, the following year. In 1872, LeMoyne became a candidate for the 43rd Congress on the Liberal Party ticket, but was defeated. He ran again for the 44th Congress as a Democrat and won.

Resisting the entreaties of men as illustrious as Colonel Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte, grandnephew of Napoleon I, Julia chose to follow her father’s advice: “‘<a href=\"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/scripto/transcribe/215/48360#transcription\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Be somebody, July.’ Papa always used to say, &amp; ‘be somebody’ I WILL. I’ve always been told I had plenty of brains, &amp; every natural advantage; so why shouldn’t I be Somebody???</a>” <br /><br />Yet the pace of her life exacerbated an underlying ailment, and in 1869 she fell seriously ill with an affliction assumed to be a “nervous” condition. Reporting the conclusion of her doctor, Julia writes that “<a href=\"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/scripto/transcribe/215/48436#transcription\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I am not allowed to read anything serious or have any kind of a lesson…I think I think the whole time &amp; that I cant help</a>.” Unsurprisingly, such cures proved ineffective, and Julia died in 1876. <a href=\"https://webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=574581\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View catalog record</a> | <a href=\"http://collections.carli.illinois.edu/cdm/ref/collection/nby_mms/id/40934\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View in digital collection</a>"

            "desc": "Jenny Dufau, a leading French soprano with the Chicago Grand Opera Company beginning in 1911, was described as the “smallest soprano” of the opera company. By 1912 she was singing important roles in Die Walkyrie in German, The Barber of Seville and The Jewels of the Madonna in Italian, and The Tales of Hoffmann in English. A native of Alsace-Lorraine, Dufau had arrived on the Chicago musical scene in 1910 following studies in Berlin, and almost immediately was successful with audiences. After 1916 she concentrated on a concert career, appearing at Ravinia and in Hamilton Park concert series, in Orchestra Hall and in Boston, among other places. In May, 1916, she sang with the silent film The Law Decides, which was one of the latest of entertainments called “Cinema Concerts.” In a 1917 recital at Orchestra Hall she sang La Marseillaise as apparently was the custom, followed by “an eclectic program” of Russian, Swedish and French songs, along with new songs written for her by Frank LaForge. Dufau’s name no longer appears in the Chicago papers after 1917, so presumably she returned to Europe at the end of the war.<br /><br />This collection consists almost entirely of letters written to Jenny Dufau by an Italian lover named Gaetano Riccuilli from September 1915, to April 1917, while Dufau was performing with the Chicago Grand Opera Company. Most of these letters concern his family or hers, the events of his daily life, the fact of their separation due to the war, and his many moods. Ricciulli apparently was an active service army officer on disability leave at the time of these letters.<br /><br />The principle historical interest of the letters lies in the many passing references to the war, especially to its disruption of civilian life in Italy, and to a lesser degree in France and Switzerland. There are repeated references to censorship, and the development of censorship is traceable by evidence on the envelopes. For a brief time after the start of censorship his letters become more circumspect, but they return to the passionate tone of the earlier ones fairly quickly. One letter speculates on the possibility that America may enter the war on the side of the Italian-French-English alliance. Except in a very general way, there is no information here on the progress of the war itself or of civilian morale, as these topics undoubtedly would have been censored. <a href=\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=808377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a> <p></p>"

As several of her siblings moved westward into Wisconsin, she followed, and though she was trained to teach school she married Asa Hurd of Brandon, Wisconsin in 1859. The young Hurds bought land in Minnesota and attempted to become successful farmers.<br /><br />Augusta and Asa Hurd had one daughter born in 1862, whom they named Mary Olivia. Six and a half months later Asa joined the Union Army as a wagoner of Company E, 10th Minnesota Infantry and Augusta and her baby rejoined her sister in the more settled and stable town of Brandon, Wisconsin. Asa never returned from the war, having apparently been killed in April, 1865, outside Montgomery, Alabama, while foraging for his company, although there is some possibility he simply disappeared west as veterans sometimes did. Augusta never remarried. She supported herself and her daughter Mary by land speculation in Minnesota and South Dakota at a time when settlers were pouring into the Territories.

What we go to face we do not know.\" Nursing in a camp hospital in Siboney, Cuba, for little over a month, Wingreen too contracted fever, but continued with her work until leaving in late August.<br /><br />The collection includes letters, often reading like a diary, which Amy Wingreen sent to her sister, mother and nephew as she traveled from Chicago to Cuba and back again to New York and Washington in the summer of 1898, plus a small group of letters to her from relatives and friends of some of the soldiers she nursed. The collection also includes miscellaneous material relating to her medical service from April, 1898, to December, 1899, and two narratives of her experiences, one by her and one by her (later) executor Esther Turkington. <a href=\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=184085\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>"

The journal of the 1851 voyage from San Francisco to New York describes hardships of travel on the recently inaugurated Nicaragua route via San Juan and Greytown, and an Atlantic voyage plagued by an inexperienced captain, coal and food shortages, and a massive storm.

When we resumed our march we had an opportunity to observe Fort Magruder where our men were sadly butchered on the 5th of May. It is a large square fort and well protected from assault by fallen timber. We camped that night a short distance from Yorktown and remained the next day in that vicinity. When the tide was out we all went down to York river and dove for oysters. and the Cornucopia was in our camp. Oysters potatoes, peaches, apples, green corn and fresh pork. On the 22d we left camp and passing through York Town moved on in the direction of New Port M Newport News, we encamped that night near Big Bethel. And the next day reached Newport News. Here plenty still reigned. we followed diving for oysters as at Yorktown. On the 26th we embarked our brigade 2200 in number on the steam transport Mississippi. On the morn. of the 27th we steamed out and reached Aqua Creek where it was thought we would land about noon on the 28th. After some delay here we steamed on toward Alexandria but it was too late to get there that night and as the Captain was afraid to run his vessel after night we anchored till morning. We landed at Alexandria on the 29th. Went into camp about 3 miles west of the city and remained until the afternoon of the 30th. When we broke up camp and marching nearly all night rested a few hours just before day. then moved on to Chain Bridge. August. 31. We were here but a few hours when orders came for us to move to the support of Gen. Pope. Accordingly we set forward by way of the Old Fair State University marched till about 11 oclock that night then",

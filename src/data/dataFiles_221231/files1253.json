O should we not acknowledge our father's hand in all our sorrows and feel that not one is in vain - and how should it humble us to think that we need so much to lead us away from earth to God.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":100031,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/100031","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ff67defb50738af533bc2964159def2e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ff67defb50738af533bc2964159def2e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ff67defb50738af533bc2964159def2e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ff67defb50738af533bc2964159def2e.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-20T01:51:55+00:00","modified":"2021-05-23T17:48:24+00:00","filename":"ff67defb50738af533bc2964159def2e.jpg","authentication":"4190becde1e07723c4ff4072650f249d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_05_fl_128_019_031_o2.jpg","size":1759083,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2898,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.056203607852158998792191368920612148940563201904296875},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20181017"],"TimeCreated":["012311+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20181017"],"TimeCreated":["012311+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20181017"],"TimeCreated":["012311+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ff67defb50738af533bc2964159def2e.jpg","FileDateTime":1587347478,"FileSize":1759083,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2898\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2898,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2019:01:03 11:58:38","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333332999803833018859222647733986377716064453125,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:10:17 01:23:11","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:10:17 01:23:11","ShutterSpeedValue":4.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":1.75,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":85,"SubSecTime":82,"SubSecTimeOriginal":82,"SubSecTimeDigitized":82,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3242,"ExifImageLength":4027,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803255,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["85\/1","85\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF85mm f\/1.8 USM"}}}},"item":{"id":1253,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1253","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Feb. 4.

A lovely sabbath morning this & may its quiet stillness be an emblem of that peace and joy which shall fill many a heart this day. I hope I do feel some gratitude to God for his goodness to me. How much does the world owe to the religion of Jesus. How it soothes and sustains the soul in trial; and in prosperity it brightens every joy. I feel more and more convinced that piety is happiness- \"the sunshine of the heart, the Sabbath of the soul, the resting place on which the heart lays down its load of cares & anxieties and sorrows.\" Blessed be God that he has given the least reason to hope that","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":100043,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/100043","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/83797d58cf04833deb572de01981437c.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/83797d58cf04833deb572de01981437c.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/83797d58cf04833deb572de01981437c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/83797d58cf04833deb572de01981437c.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-20T01:52:12+00:00","modified":"2020-07-25T11:07:11+00:00","filename":"83797d58cf04833deb572de01981437c.jpg","authentication":"fa7d7adc93ea37913141c16cd83d60c8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_05_fl_128_019_043_o2.jpg","size":1636876,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2891,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05242566329733400198875870046322233974933624267578125},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20181017"],"TimeCreated":["013006+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20181017"],"TimeCreated":["013006+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20181017"],"TimeCreated":["013006+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"83797d58cf04833deb572de01981437c.jpg","FileDateTime":1587347479,"FileSize":1636876,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2891\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2891,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2019:01:03 11:59:01","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333332999803833018859222647733986377716064453125,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:10:17 01:30:06","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:10:17 01:30:06","ShutterSpeedValue":4.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":1.75,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":85,"SubSecTime":36,"SubSecTimeOriginal":36,"SubSecTimeDigitized":36,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3234,"ExifImageLength":4027,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803255,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["85\/1","85\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF85mm f\/1.8 USM"}}}},"item":{"id":1253,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1253","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"my soul possesses one little spark of this living, vital Home.

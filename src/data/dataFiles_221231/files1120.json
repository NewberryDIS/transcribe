These little gatherings are generally known as \"cottage prayer-meetings. This object is a very commendable one to me: for it whispers of the olden time, when the Apostles went about from house to house, preaching the Master's word. As usual, at the one in question:\n\"The voice of my father ascended on high,\" as the old poem goes. Others prayed: & each petition seemed unclear by a true motive. I listened, with much attention to the various remarks were made. Some portions of them suited me; others didn't: for I am somewhat peculiar in my religious views. God has never manifested Himself to my life & soul, as I have every reason to believe He has done to a vast majority of His more faithful followers. As regards certain points perhaps I may be walking in the dark. If so, He knows my heart, & \"I will trust & not be afraid.\" Several of our good, old hymns were sung; & if they did lack a little in perfection & harmony, they sounded sweet & good to my believing ear.

He has a tender, sensitive heart, but which, only the One above him, has ever fully understood.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":79248,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/79248","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c69d5b8c1bdc475541a7801829a12e42.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c69d5b8c1bdc475541a7801829a12e42.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c69d5b8c1bdc475541a7801829a12e42.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c69d5b8c1bdc475541a7801829a12e42.jpg"},"added":"2018-10-02T17:21:47+00:00","modified":"2020-03-27T21:27:38+00:00","filename":"c69d5b8c1bdc475541a7801829a12e42.jpg","authentication":"d215ef17e3dc6af73acc1074e333b838","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_barnes_e_box_1_fl_7_11_5_8_1875_037_o2.jpg","size":1240033,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2848,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040315263472742002281989925904781557619571685791015625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171002"],"TimeCreated":["033200"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["844390"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171002"],"TimeCreated":["033200"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["844390"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171002"],"TimeCreated":["033200"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["844390"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c69d5b8c1bdc475541a7801829a12e42.jpg","FileDateTime":1538500887,"FileSize":1240033,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2848\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2848,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:10:05 16:53:01","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333332999803833018859222647733986377716064453125,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:10:02 03:32:00","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:10:02 03:32:00","ShutterSpeedValue":4.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":1.75,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":85,"SubSecTimeOriginal":13,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2978,"ExifImageLength":3764,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803255,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["85\/1","85\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF85mm f\/1.8 USM"}}}},"item":{"id":1120,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1120","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"19\nThe busy week is fast & gone.

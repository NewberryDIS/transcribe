Now it happened that I was working\nin a closely related field and was familiar with the techniques which\nwere employed for such determinations.  Mainly, it depended on\npaper chromatography which is a tedious process by which an\nextract of steroids is dropped in a very small, measured amount on\nthe end of a long strip of filter paper which has been treated with\nan appropriate solvent.  Under standard conditions, the drop\ncontaining whatever steroids were present in the extract, is allowed\nto travel along the moist paper, which is hung in a special\nchamber for a given number of hours.  The rate of travel serves\nto separate each hormone and by developing the strip, it is\npossible to see the size of the spots made by the various\nhormones in a pure state, and the spots can even be quantitively\nremoved and measured.  The whole thing is very ingenious, but\nit was terribly tedious and cumbersome, and far from reliable even\nwhen I used to move through the whole process alone.  There are too\nmany steps, and each step has its weak point.  And when the technique\nwas first used, it worked out fairly well for cortisone and for \nhydrocortisone, but aldosterone, present in much smaller amounts,\nfailed to show up with the same pair of solvents, hence its relationship\nto the others - particularly, cortisone and  hydrocortisone  - remained\na little vague.  So, on the occasion of the meeting that I've referred\nto, and the paper on the aldosterone secreting [?], the flush of my\nfirst admiration faded suddenly when it occured to me to wonder if\nit was actually true.   I remembered that the leader of the two\nresearch groups were good friends and that the pressure from the medical\nschools and from the sources of federal grants-in-aid is\nvery great.   It's produce, or else lose your grant.  On the other\nhand, there are so many highly-specialized techniques that almost\nno group is able to asses the contributions of another,  hence the\nultimate analysis, to declare them \"reproducible\" or \"not reproducible\"\nor, in simple English, true or false.

By this I mean that\nthe surgeon is on a salary from the clinic and it is not directly \npaid by the patient.

Then there\nis the technical part to be learned, the cutting and staining of sections of\ntissues and the mounting of slides.\n\n   It was about at this time that I had one of the great experiences\n\nof my medical education, although I recently checked with my embryology\nprofessor and discovered that the experience must have been in part\nhallucinatory.  It had to do with the origin of pulsation in the developing\ncardio-vascular system.   You may know, Inspector, that the foetal blood vessels\nform on the yolk of the fertilized ovum and that they branch and grow\nuntil, at the site of the future heart, the primitive vessels [?] together, clasp, \nfuse, to form the right and left sides of the heart.   These in turn modify and\nbreak through to become the four chambered heart of man, two auricles\nand two ventricles.   There the blood is sent into the lungs by the right ventricle \nand is returned, oxygenated, to the left ventricle from which it passes into\nthe left ventricle and out to the periphery through the aorta returning\nto the right auricle it goes back to the right ventricle to repeat the \noxygenation process.  But note that all of this stems from the activity of\na few cells which function as the \"pace-maker,\" the instigator of the\ncardiac construction.  All this multiplication and differentiation of embryonal\ncells,  all this [?] tingling of developing life has gone on, up\nto a certain point, like vegetative growth, complicated but [?] so\nto speak, a mute destiny locked within its chromosomes.  And then, at\nthat magic, that mysterious moment, those interlocking embryonal blood\nvessels must twitch, tremble in their strange, gelatinous developing.  Yes,\nInspector, they must flicker feebly as they are caught up in their great\nfuture.  And there it must be like the first chiming of a great bell, but\nintense, divine.   And he twitching becomes regular, rhythmic, and\nsoon the whole new organism has become [?], permeated with \nthe gift of pulsation, and a new human has come into being.\n\n   I don't remember how this was demonstrated to  us, but however it\n\nwas presented, the diagrams, slides, words - it kindled my imagination\nwith the same pulsation and I have never forgotten it.

Sickness arouses some\nof our deepest apprehensions and superstitions.  It seems to us to come\nfrom the outside, hence it represents an attack or an invasion:  something\nwe eat, drink or breathe, even something we touch.  And behind\nthat something, you can see traces of the earliest war gods\nof all, those that earliest man recognized and set himself to placate.

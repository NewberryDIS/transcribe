The people were all seated and observed perfect silence. No one durst speak, or make the least noise while the priest was talking. About noon the priest became very much fatigued, but still continued his discourse till near sunset.  He enforced obedience to God in every respect, telling the people they must do all that God had directed them and never disobey in any secret place, thinking themselves alone; for God always saw them, and was with them.  He exhorted the people never to indulge in any idle or vain conversation, nor call anyone A ski ni, because it was wicked.  He urged them to abstain from all lewdness and from Polygamy. Children he exhorted to be industrious and alwas ming (sic: always mind) their parents. \n  He enforced his exhortations by holding up to the people the prospects of futurity, assuring that if they were obedient, when they died, they would go to God, and dwell forever with Him, where it would be always light, like a pleasant delightful day.  But that if they were disobedient, they would be miserable forever in a lake of fire.  That just as they got to that place an awful gulph would appear before them, across which they would see a small pole, with a black dog at each end.  Being impelled forward, they would go onto the middle of this pole, and then the dogs would turn it, and plunge them off into the gulph or lake of fire.  Some few, however, might be permitted to cross, but on arriving at the other side, they would be put into a house of fire, and transfixed with large iron spikes, and thus tortured forever. \n  At death the righteous & wicked would be immediately separated; and the wicked driven forward in a different path from the righteous.  \n  Just before sunset the priest offered sacrifice.  The altar was made of flat rock about 2 1\/2 feet high, of one stone or more.  The sacrifice was a piece of meat, with a powder of old tobacco sprinkled on.  The fire was not common, but made new, as follows viz. the priest put a dry stick on the altar, with a round shallow hole in the upper side.  In this hole he put some of the weed called Golden rod.  He then took a stick 2 or 3 feet long, the lower end of which exactly filled the hole or socket above mentioned.  This stick, standing upright in the hole, on the golden rod, he whisked swiftly round, till the golden rod caught fire in the socket.

The man obeyed -- but his warning had no effect. The messenger was sent again with the message; but again the warning was unavailing. So also the third time, the messenger was then sent to direct the man to build a house that would float on the water, and go into it with his family, and take in some of all kinds of animals.  This he did.  God caused the animals to come to him, and then the doors of the house were shut and the rain commenced.  The people tried to save themselves on hills but were at length all drowned. After some time the man opened a place and sent out a raven to look for dry land, but finding none he returned to the house.  After some time again he sent out a turtle dove.  This bird returned with mud in its claws, which showed that the earth began to appear.  Raven (a blind man)\n\nThe above person viz the Raven image above the word \"Raven\" (supposed to be considerably upwards of a hundred years old.) says that when a small boy, the old men used to predict the destruction of the world, after four generations, in the following manner.  The Lord would cause a storm to rise out of the east, which would rain pitch till every thing was covered with it.  This being followed by a storm of fire, would be set in a blaze, and consume the whole world.\nThe Natchez Indians say that sometime after the creation, children began to marry very young, and have children of their own; and at length some children were born with full sets of teeth.  God was displeased, and sent a dog to tell a certain man, that on account of the weakness of the people, in twelve nights He would cause the water to gush out of the ground and destroy them all.  Therefore he must make a raft of twelve plank, and take his family and the dog onto it that they might be preserved.  He did so, and at the set time the water gushed out of the ground and bore the family up above all the hills and trees.  But nothing else, not a log, nor anything swam, but every thing lay just as it was, so that the people could bi no means save themselves from drowning.  On the seventh day after the flood came, the waters dried away.  This man then went out, taking with him, & his family, the dog & fire; and God told him then that the world should not be again destroyed by water, but by fire.

He appointed their feasts, -- their fasts, and all their ceremonies.  He also told them how to consecrate their priests, make their Kings &c. and enjoined it upon them to obey his instructions forever, ie. from generation to generation.  He enjoined perfect obedience to God their Father above, and warned them of the misery which would follow their disobedience.  He said that when he died one would take his place and give them the same kind of instructions, and directions as he had done. citation: Nutsawi (Pinelog.  \nWhen a successor was appointed to fill the place of the prophet above mentioned, the following ceremonies were observed. viz.

A speaker was then sent for four different ways, & at four different times, before a suitable person could be found. On his arrival, he made a very lengthy speech to the people, and at the conclusion directed all to salute the king. Each one then went individually near his seat, and bowing, said, Tsa ku wi hi tso lo. To which he replied, he replied Ho. Then all sat down in silence all night. At daybreak the king made his speech to the people, in which he promised to exercise his authority in all respects according to the commandments of God; after which all the people promised obedience to him. The assembly then continued in their seats till about noon, when the young people withdrew. The lower officers filled his tobacco pouch with old tobacco. This was a part of his dress, hanging on his left shoulder, at his right side. \nThe king then arose, and two of the highest officers, one at each side, putting their hands under his arms, partly supported him, as he held his sceptre with his right hand over his shoulder, and walked, first to the door, and then to his own house. On arriving at his own residence, his official dress was taken off, and put away in a room for the purpose, in a double cane basket having a lid. His face was then washed, and a common dress put on him.

Then he gave the same to the second &c. till each messenger was supplied, i.e the messenger of each town first. The council being dissolved, all the members dispersed to their respective towns; and as soon as convenient, each priest collected the inhabitants of his town, when his messenger, at a proper season brought forward the stick of beads & tobacco and delivered them to the principal men of the town, together with the talk from the national council. While delivering this talk, or making known the acts of the council, the old men were smoking the tobacco. \n\nThe messenger then selected a man to order the next green corn feast, and gave him notice of the selection. He then took the beads from the stick, and wound them round a staff from one end to the other, and went out into the town house yard, and called aloud, Atsi nu sti. The man above selected, started, went out of the house, danced round the yard singing \"Ni-ta ka ni,-ni ta ka ni\" &c. then came to the messenger of the council, took the staff and exclaimed, Na wi go ni ka li sta, to which all exclaimed Waneh. With these beads from the council the man received full authority from the U ku, & national council to hold the first of green fruits in that particular town.  citation:  Nusawi.  The above plan of authorizing each town to hold the green fruit feast separately, was probably adopted to prevent the labour and trouble of all meeting together. \nThe councils were appointed by the U ku, and his privy council. The other chiefs, however, if they saw any special cause for a national council, had a right to request it; and in that case the U ku complied with their wishes. This sometimes rendered the councils irregular. But the general time for the national council was in the spring, before the feast of first fruits. On calling a council, the U ku raised the national standard at the council house. This consisted of a very long pole, painted white, (with white clay) - on the top was painted a certain kind, and to the top was fastened a white cloth (or white dressed deerskin) four or five yards long, having red spots like stars painted on it.

But in case danger was apprehended the U ku and the great warrior & suit, all smoked the tobacco together. The U ku then hoisted the national flag, and dispatched his messenger to give notice to the council to be immediately convened. The council coming together and determining on war, hastened to paint the national standard, and flag red. They also painted themselves, red, together with their bows and arrows, warclubs, and other weapons of war.  The council selected four physicians, one for each war party (the whole body of soldiers were divided into four companies.)  Seven counsellors were then selected, one of each clan, to direct in each company, in all twenty eight, seven for each of the four companies.  A priest was called upon by the council to officiate for the whole army, or, as was sometimes the case, the seven counsellors of each company selected a priest for their company in particular.

(not physic dance. Three Killer) \n\nThe stated time for holding this feast was the first of autumn. This, in modern times, has been held in several places in the nation. (Doubtless in more ancient times the whole nation met. enquire farther) Seven days previous to the feast, the seven counsellors convened the people at an all night dance (what seven counsellors) strikeout: (all priests I think) and gave notice that the above feast would commence on the seventh day from that time. The priests right hand man then selected seven counsellors, one from each clan, to assist on the occasion & to fast, together with seven women selected from the seven clans. He also selected seven men to cleanse the council house - repair the altar, new whitewash all the benches, posts, joists, and vessels for the occasion, & to whip the houses (to drive away the evil spirits) He then selected seven men to hunt, and others to provide the articles for purification. (All articles used for healing or curing the diseases of the body, and for cleaning bodily or mental defilements, are called by one general name nu wa ti, which we translate medicine.) The next morning the priest and his right hand man, the seven counsellors, and the seven women commenced fasting, and for six days ate only once in twenty four hours left margin, vertical note: Confirm a little after sunset and then nothing but light food (enquire). \nThe hunters at the same time commenced the labour assigned them; and the first buck they shot down, the chief hunter approached, and taking hold of the tongue before touching it in any other place, cut off a piece from the end on the right side, and wrapped it up in leaves, for sacrifice. The man who shot the buck, then took off the skin, and barbicued the meat, which together with the skin and the skins of all the deer killed on the occasion belonged to the priest, and were delivered to his right hand man on the return of the hunters. But, the priest must not taste of the flesh of the buck, till he had offered the tongue for sacrifice. Those also appointed to provide the articles for purification, went in search of them. These articles were the following viz.

P. 447 Hebrew: Gimmel Chet Denotes circularity of motion or form. -- The word is applied to the celebration of religious feasts, whether in honor of the true God; or of idols, as, 1 Kings 12:32. and in the reduplicate form it plainly denotes dancing round in circles. 1Sam. 30:16. - It is moreover certain that religious dances were used in the worship of the true God; (Judg. 21:19, 21, 2 Sam. 6:14, 16. 1 Chron. 15:29.) and it is well known how eminent a part they made in the religious rites of the ancient heathen. The ancient idolaters (probably) by these dances intended to attribute the progressive rotations of the earth & planets in their circular orbits to the independent power of their God the heavens; and the performance of this service by believers was disregarded to reclaim those motions to Jehovah, as the original author of them. Parkhurst under the word Hebrew: Gimmel Chet As the religious dances of the Jews were circular, so especially are those of the Indians. strikeout: All Their dances, at religious festivals, all their ball play dances, and war dances are all performed in the same manner.

This feat was annually on the first of September, or soon after; and also during the year, when any dangerous sickness was feared, the yo wa was sung & the above feast celebrated.  citation: Corn Tastle.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70293,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70293","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ed1da9798cd905ea834e0bec3f52cbab.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ed1da9798cd905ea834e0bec3f52cbab.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ed1da9798cd905ea834e0bec3f52cbab.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ed1da9798cd905ea834e0bec3f52cbab.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:26:37+00:00","modified":"2022-02-14T15:48:11+00:00","filename":"ed1da9798cd905ea834e0bec3f52cbab.jpg","authentication":"d785e5a0cd4a52ade1f9397fb2351548","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL03_FL001_00021_o2.jpg","size":922042,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2966,"compression_ratio":0.0575686171674029967260111106952535919845104217529296875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ed1da9798cd905ea834e0bec3f52cbab.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423561,"FileSize":922042,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2966\"","Height":2966,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2966,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:06:40","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":814,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5389},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:18 14:04:26","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:18 14:04:26","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":8,"SubSecTimeDigitized":8,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2966,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":1051,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1051","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"34 The seven counsellors of the priest selected a man to sing the yo wa, when the one previously appointed was sick or dead.

After this was one used for finding things lost or stolen and last of all was that used for determining the time any one had to live.   These stones are chrystalline quartz, with six sides, coming to a point at one end like the diamond, are perfectly transparent, and were doubtless selected instead or to take the place of the diamond used by the ancients, shaped thus, diagram of 5-sided structure resembling a house, only regular in its parts.

In case the child was to be thus set apart, the priest who was to have the care of his education was called as soon as the child was born, to take it under his tuition. Before it was put to the breast he gave it a kind of purifying drink; and as the child was not able to fast, he directed the parents to fast for it seven days, eating only at night about sunset.  As the child grew up he was watched with the utmost scrutiny. And as the mother was liable to her monthly courses, the son was delivered as soon as possible into the hands of a grand mother or some aged matron, not subject to any female defilements; and her eye was almost continually upon him.  She would not allow him to go into any house as he pleased and sit down lest he should be defiled by some polluted seat.  Neither must he eat any food but such as his protectress pronounced clean.  She also guarded him from any defilement from the dead.  As he became capable of understanding he was taken to the priest who spent occasionally twenty hours with him, without eating or sleeping, instructing him in the great doctrines and duties of religion, but especially in those ceremonies connected with the use of the Tsu lu sa ta. If devoted to war, the arts &c. of war were especially informed on his

 Sometimes sons were not consecrated to sacred office till eight or nine years old. In this case the priest took the boy about day light onto a high hill, gave him the water of purification, the same given to the infant; and then ordered him to look toward the east, so as to catch the first rays of light from the rising sun, and then follow that orb with his eyes, not looking off till its last rays were lost in the western horizon; and thus the boy did.  The old man stayed by him, observing a strict fast during the day.  Should the boy during the day take his eyes from the sun, the rule would be violated. At night the priest took the boy and spent the whole night in walking with him in this silent retreat, giving him instructions on various subjects, but especially respecting the use and soundness of the Tsu lu sa ta.

Here he instructed him again in the various duties of his intended office.  A little after sunset this day they ate some of the root of which the purifying drink was made.  They had now fasted forty eight hours, i.e. two days and nights & one night without sleep.  In this retreat they continued five days more, eating nothing but the above mentioned root, and that only once a day, a little after sunset; only on the seventh day and night they watched and fasted twenty four hours, not eating or sleeping.

On looking at this stone, if they saw an old man with white hair, and or white beard, they understood that the boy was to live to very old age.  But if in the stone was seen a man with black hair and black beard, they boy would die young.  The priest then took the boy to a river, and ordered him to wade in, and stand facing the east, while he stood on the bank, with his face in the same direction and prayed for him.  After prayers, he ordered the boy to plunge entirely seven times, first with his head toward the east, then toward the west, then east & alternately.

Suppose two young men conceived a peculiar fondness for each other, and desired to enter into the strongest bonds of perpetual friendship, they went to that feast or fast of purification when the yo was was sung: taking an opportunity, sometime during that feast, when the people were seated in the council house, they arose, walked toward the fire, and then turned and commenced dancing round the fire, what is called the A to hu na, or friendship dance, each having on his best clothes.  While dancing in the presence of all the people, while looking, thus exchanged one garment after another till each had given the other his entire dress, even to legings, mocasins &c. and thus each of them publicly received the other as himself, & became thus pledged to regard and treat him as himself while he lived.  Sometimes two women, and sometimes a man and a woman contracted this friendship.  Thus when a young man and woman fell in love with each other but were hindered from marrying, either by relations or by being of the same clan, they bound themselves in perpetual friendship.  While dancing round the fire as above stated, the man throws his blanket over the woman, and the woman as soon as convenient threw hers to the man.  The man also having prepared a cane sieve, & hung it by a string over his shoulder, gave her that. He also presented her with a pestle to pound corn with.  The mortar he had for her at home. \n\nFriends among the Cherokees, must share with each other whatever they might have.  They must also, if requested always reveal whatever secret they might know. To hide any thing from a friend was betraying a want of confidence inconsistent with the ties of that friendship by which they were bound.  But friends must never reveal secrets thus made known to them. citation:  T Smith.

These were the souls of persons who had died previously.  The family would then prepare victuals and carry onto the mountain, or near the place where their friend was buried, and set it on a rock or some other conspicuous place, & these little spirits would trouble them no more.  It is said that a man once died and his spirit afterward kept always about the house till the family prepared victuals & placed them on a rock near his grave, and then the spirit spoke to the person who put the victuals there & troubled the family no more.  Witches were living persons assisted by some evil spirit.  Anciently, it is said, these were very dangerous, so that it was not safe for persons to be out after dark.  They would frequently come about houses, and knock, knock, knock about in various parts of the house.  The head of the family+ then filled his pipe with old tobacco, and smoked about in the house & out, blowing the smoke in every direction.  At length some of the smoke would get into the witch's throat and produce a strikeout: sneething sneezing, and then all the family were secure.  The witch would immediately depart, and in a day or two would be dead, certainly in seven days after inhaling the tobacco smoke.  When one was sick in a house, witches would be constantly flocking about it, therefore the old tobacco had to be smoked there continually.  Witches would sometimes get in some corner of the house and sing like an owl, and again, make various kinds of noises.  citation: Nutsawi.

These, on being found dead in the road were dried and burnt to a coal, and whoever rubbed thei'r eyes with this coal were enabled to see witches, and thus to kill them, because no witch could live over seven days after being thus seen.  citation: Nutsawi.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70314,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70314","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/9df427aff93f976affdf9d223ccdd56b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/9df427aff93f976affdf9d223ccdd56b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/9df427aff93f976affdf9d223ccdd56b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9df427aff93f976affdf9d223ccdd56b.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:26:57+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:55:26+00:00","filename":"9df427aff93f976affdf9d223ccdd56b.jpg","authentication":"9555f50f71c619b5fde4e1adb699abc7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL03_FL001_00033_o2 copy.jpg","size":839325,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2965,"compression_ratio":0.0524217725313849969293045205631642602384090423583984375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"9df427aff93f976affdf9d223ccdd56b.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423562,"FileSize":839325,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2965\"","Height":2965,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2965,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:06:51","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":814,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4455},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:18 14:09:25","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:18 14:09:25","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":17,"SubSecTimeDigitized":17,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2965,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":1051,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1051","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"55 Signs. v On strikeout: starting commencing a journey should one start a fox, and should the fox after running a few steps look back and bark, that would be a sign that some one of his family or neighbours would die before his return or soon after.

But if they had not a wire they daubed pitch on their faces, and by means of that pulled out the beard with their fingers.  citation: T. Smith.  Formerly many wore a long beard, yet some considered it unbecoming, and therefore pulled out their own beards, and doctored their sons by rubbing something on their faces to prevent the beard from growing.  citation: Zacheriah.  The Raven, supposed to be considerably over one hundred years old, & now blind, says that anciently the Cherokee men uniformly wore a long beard, as their fathers had done, & considered it peculiarly ornamental.  It seldom grew over six inches long.  It was considered an almost unpardonable offense to seize a man by his beard.  When one did it, he was generally killed by witches before another morning.  The Raven says that when a lad, he feared his beard would not be so thick and long as was desirable; and being told what to do to promote its growth, he commenced doctoring it.  He accordingly took the skin, with the long hair on it, from the underside of the lower jaw of a Buffalo, and chestnut burrs, and burnt them together, and took the ashes and coal of the skin, and mixed them with bears oil, and rubbed the mixture on his face.  The medicine, however, proved ineffectual, and he never had as heavy a beard as he had desired.  \n\nSome platted their beards, one braid hanging from each side of the mouth, & one from the chin; though more generally it hung loose.  That on the upper lip, was either pulled out, or kept cut about half an inch long, so as not to hang over the mouth.  \nThe Raven says that the old men used to tell them that the ancient Cherokees had always been in the habit of wearing a long beard.  About the same time that the Cherokees commenced pulling out their beards (probably 80, or 100 years ago) they also began the custom of pulling out the hair, so as to form a ring round the crown, about two inches wide, leaving a tuft on the crown about as large as the palm of the hand.  Men began thus to pull out the hair when about forty or forty five years old, and would continue pulling it till at length it would not grow, and the skin from which it was pulled appeared as if no hair had ever grown on it.

Their consultation however was little more than a mere expression of opinion.  Being seated together the great war chief, after stating some circumstances of the case, said to his fellow, It is my wish to engage in the war.  What is your opinion.  I also wish for war, replied his right hand man.  The great chief then arose, saying We will mourn (or give ourselves up) He then took a rattling gourd in his hand, went out into the yard, -- raised the war whoop, and commenced singing the following line, repeating it four times ri gi wea ne e shaking at the same time his rattling gourd.

At length he went into his house, laid down his gourd and took his seat.  His fellow then arose, took the gourd, went through the same maneuvers, and took his seat.  The warriors living near heard the war whoop, and immediately sounded it again for their fellows who lived more remote, and started.  Others again hearing them, again raised the whoop themselves, and ran.  Thus the information spread almost immediately far & wide, that in a few minutes vast numbers had gathered about the house from all parts of the town.  The warriors being assembled, the great war chief arose and told them that it was now determined to comfort those who were still mourning for their friends who had been killed by such a nation, and whose blood had not been revenged.  Messengers were then dispatched to every war chief throughout all the towns in the nation.  Each war chief, on receiving the message, consulted his fellow, or the next in authority, in the same manner that the great war chief did at first, took the rattling gourd, walked the yard, raised the war whoop and in short they went through all the maneuvers of the first two; in order to gather the warriors of the town.  And on the arrival of the warriors, all marched under the direction of the town war chief & under officers.

This man accordingly notified the war priest, and on his accepting the appointment, the messenger, now his assistant, went back to the town (probably to the treasure house, back of the council house) to a place where seven dressed deer skins had been deposited, and took them to the priest.  The priest then wrapped his u lu sa ta in those seven deer skins, and gave it to his assistant to carry, going forward while he with the holy ark followed behind.  This ark was made either like an earthen box with a lid, or as in some cases like an earthen pot having a lid.  In this the holy fire was constantly kept burning, but should it go out new fire must be made.  But in case the warriors of each town chose to have a war priest from each of their respective towns they could do so, and the seven counsellors of each war chief could appoint their respective priests.  The seven counsellors appointed women to prepare provision for the army.  This consisted of parched corn mean, and corn bread.  The bread was made in long cakes, about six inches wide.  This was baked on the hot hearth, covered with leaves and hot ashes.  In general each town furnished provision for its own men.  The warriors carried their own provisions.  Of course on some expeditions they were heavily loaded when they first started.  They also furnished themselves with weapons, and armour.  Their war club & in later times their tomahawk, they carried in the belt.  The whole army being assembled, a day and night were devoted prayer, fasting, and wakefulness.  None must eat or sleep.  And no one must take anything whatever from the house of another, but the thing to be passed from one to another, must be dropped on the ground and picked up.  On this day the seven counsellors above mentioned appointed the under officers for the first company, musicians, Doctor, cooks, &c. &c.  Then seven counsellors from the next two towns appointed officers & for their strikeout: town company & so on, each two towns forming together one company.  The principal officers were as follows, viz. First.  The great war chief, now called the Raven, has a raven skin fastened about his neck.  Second, the Ka ta ti ka ne hi, or flag carrier, considered an equal in almost all respects with the first.  The flag was raised on a hole painted red, and consisted of a red cloth, or a deer skin painted red.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70319,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70319","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/cdc1bd37d81f1dead414df146e587959.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/cdc1bd37d81f1dead414df146e587959.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/cdc1bd37d81f1dead414df146e587959.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cdc1bd37d81f1dead414df146e587959.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:27:02+00:00","modified":"2022-02-01T22:27:55+00:00","filename":"cdc1bd37d81f1dead414df146e587959.jpg","authentication":"740aab5d61fc968773bbf585839e31f2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL03_FL001_00037_o2 copy.jpg","size":951436,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":3017,"compression_ratio":0.0583996857314720008158559494404471479356288909912109375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120618"],"TimeCreated":["000000+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cdc1bd37d81f1dead414df146e587959.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423562,"FileSize":951436,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"3017\"","Height":3017,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":3017,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:06:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":814,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5536},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:18 14:11:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:18 14:11:01","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":2,"SubSecTimeDigitized":2,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":3017,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":1051,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1051","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"60   Third Ska.li lo ski, or the great speaker.

They ran so as to form two wings, as if to enclose the enemy, while the great warrior went directly forward, meeting his equal, in office, on the side of the enemy, and either conquored or died, unless possibly saved by his warriors.\n But the general method of the Cherokees was to set an ambush for their enemies, so as to form an acute angle > and send out a few men, that their enemies might suppose they had but few to contend with, till they found themselves unexpectedly surrounded.

The first at the appearance of the first new moon in the spring, about the time grass began to grow. The second was the green corn feast, when green corn became fit to eat.  The third was the second great green corn feast, about fifty days after the first.  The fourth was at the first new moon in autumn.  The fifth was about ten days after the last, and was called tto hu na. And the sixth was E la wo ta te g\n\nThese feasts are often called dances, as the people generally during the feasts devoted much tine to dancing. This was a religious ceremony. It was always performed\nin a similar manner, that is in a circle, or circles. The  performers moved with the left hand always, toward the centre of the circle.  Anciently they had but one kind of dance at all their feasts which was called ttohyna. Each company, i.e. all + special attention was paid, it seems to purity of manners, by obliging wives to follow their own husbands in the dance and all single women their own brothers or persons of their own clan, whom they could no more marry than their own brothers. Each clan also when seated occupied its own side of the council house, which always had seven sides.\n\nAs the fruits of the earth began to spring forth about the first of spring, this began the year with regard to most of the national feasts.

At evening each man put up his green bough and took it again the next day: and during the evening the men and women united in social dances, wives following their husbands, and young women and girls, their brothers of others of the same clan with themselves.\nThis feast was provided for in the same manner as the first. The men of the chief town furnished meat, while every family brought new fruit ready cooked from home as a thank offering.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70363,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70363","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/a0841c3256f21d56bc15ef4b0b226357.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/a0841c3256f21d56bc15ef4b0b226357.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/a0841c3256f21d56bc15ef4b0b226357.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a0841c3256f21d56bc15ef4b0b226357.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:27:43+00:00","modified":"2022-02-11T15:36:25+00:00","filename":"a0841c3256f21d56bc15ef4b0b226357.jpg","authentication":"25343ca91a4a9256b97db36d9dd5d631","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL03_FL002_00015_o2 copy.jpg","size":818890,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2903,"compression_ratio":0.052237787218841001679603408547336584888398647308349609375},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["093303-0700"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["093303-0700"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["093303-0700"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a0841c3256f21d56bc15ef4b0b226357.jpg","FileDateTime":1522423564,"FileSize":818890,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2903\"","Height":2903,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2903,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:07:23","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":814,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4186},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 09:33:03","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 09:33:03","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":17,"SubSecTimeDigitized":17,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2903,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":1051,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1051","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"20  Feast of Green fruits as described by Nutsawi & Corn Tassel & others.

The chief hunter therefore, stepped up, and before touching it in any other place, took hold of his tongue, and cut off a piece from the end of the right side, -- wrapped it in old leaves of the last year, and put it up for sacrifice.  The man who shot the deer, then skinned and dressed it, & barbicued the meat.  The meat of this buck, the skin, and the skins of all the deer killed on this occasion were the property of the priest, and delivered to his right hand man on the return of the hunters, but the priest must not eat any of the meat of the buck till he has offered the tongue for sacrifice.  On the evening of the sixth day the hunters came in with the meat barbecued, which was deposited in a house at the west side of the council house for the purpose of storing away meat, -- first fruit, &c. at the national feasts and also for depositing or treasuring up provisions brought for the priests and old men that lived at the council house.

This moon evidently included the latter part of September and fore part of October.\nThe seven counsellors of the N ku who directed in all the national feasts, were very particular in determining the time when this new moon would appear. They counted, it is\n\nsaid, the nights from the new moon before, and also watched the waning of the old moon. But in case the moon could not be seen, and there was any doubt respecting it, the priests would, it was said, determine by the divining stones, the day of the new moon.\n\nHaving determined the time when the new moon would appear, the seven counsellors made arrangements for the feast. They assembled, seven nights previous to the feast,\n\ndirected all the hunters in the chief town to start the next morning in pursuit of meat. They also appointed seven, honorable women to cook, and prepare the victuals, and seven men to prepare tables seats &c. and direct the feast.\n\nThe hunters returned the day the new moon was to appear, with their meat barbicued, having been out six nights (but some say they had hunted\u00a0? nights) and deposited the meat in the treasure house. The meat of the buck however, from which the end of the tongue was taken for sacrifice, & seven deer skins, were given to the priest. The tongue was also delivered to him, wrapped in old leaves, which must be burnt as soon as the tongue was offered. In all cases the tongue must be sacrificed, or burnt, before the priest could eat or taste of the flesh of the deer from which it was taken.\n On this evening also the whole nation assembled. Each family brought hard corn say seven ears, beans, also pumpkins dried, and all kinds of fruit they had raised, and delivered to the priest for his support, or rather, it was said to feed his friends who should from time to time call on him.

All watched for the first appearance of this new moon, and on the first sight of it assembled at the house of the priest (or conjuror, as at\n\npresent) who was on this occasion attended by two right hand men, subject to his orders. One of these assistants selected seven men to sing for the women; The first of these\ntool his seat, and commenced singing. The women then started in the dance, which consisted of a slow step in a circle round the fire. The woman who led the dance had a tarapin shell, partly filled with pebble tied to the calf of her leg.\n\nWhen the first singer had concluded his song or rather music, which he did in about three  quarters of an hour, he stopped and retired, and the women took their seats.

He then took a little bunch of weeds, and dipped it in fresh blood, either of a deer, or fowls, and drew a streak of blood on the skins from the tail to the head. On this streak of blood on the buck skin he set his diamond, or Ul lu sa ta, in the middle of the skin, and also seven strands of beads, one for each clan.

But of either of the above kinds of wood could not be obtained, then some other sort was selected, & used in its place.

He then proceeded to relate the following anecdote. Soon after, the world was made, the sun, in passing over, perceived that it was not large enough to support all the inhabitants, should they multiply, and never die, and therefor the decided that the people must not live forever; The sun had a daughter in the world, who was at length bitten by a serpent, and died. When the sun came over again, he (or she) enquired for his ( or her) daughter; and was told that she was dead, and only his baby remained. The sun then told the people to make a tight box- and go to a certain place where they would see the spirit of his daughter dancing about in the air;- that must watch and as she came near them, and seize her and put her in the box and take her back to her body and then open the box let her spirit loose to reanimate her baby again. He assured them that if that would bring his daughter to life again he would allow them to  live forever. He charged them however to be sure and not open the box till they came to her body. The people readily obeyed the direction of the Sun,- made the box,- repaired to the place,- saw the spirit, - caught it, - put it into the box and started. The spirit of the daughter, however, was continually entreating them to open the box and let her see and let her enjoy a little fresh air; but remembering what the sun had told them they shut their ears to her cries and hastened on. At length, however, just before they got home, they were overcome, and concluded to peek so far as to give her a few rays of light, when at once she gave a leap and was gone, and with her, the immortality of the human race.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}]

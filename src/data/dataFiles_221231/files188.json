Yes, that happy band is broken.  Once has departed for realms of eternity.  Others are scattered here and there engaging in the busy walks of life; while others still, are yet remaining preparing themselves I trust for a career of future usefulness.   As it has been quite a long time since you heard directly from me, I will endeavor to give you a short account of what has been my situation since we separated at your mother's in Philipston.  A few days from that time I left home for the purpose of attending school at Wesminster.  I found the principal J. R. Gant to be a very fine man.  He was wholly devoted to his task and I think strove so to conduct his school that it would be of the greatest advantage to all those under his charge.  The thought almost startles me, when I recollect, that since then nearly nine months of my time has been spent attending school, and still that there is so much left I had desired to learn ere I left school as a scholar.

Soon after receiving the sorrowful intelligence of Mrs. Kendall's deceased I wrote to Mrs. Weaver and expressed our sympathy with you all in your deep affection.  It afforded us a melancholly pleasure to read the particulars of our dear friend's death, for how beautiful was her calmness at the hour of departing, and how consoling to your afflicted heart to hear from her own life assurance of continued watchfulness and affection in her Home beyond the skies.  Blessed thought for those who are this suddenly delivered of the society of dear friends, to know that while they feel sad and lonely, the Angel spirits of the departed are happy in Heaven.  It seems only natural that she should have felt this resigned for those who are as well prepared to live as she was are always prepared to die.  Hers was a Christian life in the highest acceptation of the term, corresponding in every particulars with a beautiful verse I committed to memory a short time since showing who might be considered true Christians.  They who have kept their sympathies awake, And scattered blessings for more than customs sake.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43188,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43188","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e71bce5ff9f40d198b473f78ebce8d2d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e71bce5ff9f40d198b473f78ebce8d2d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e71bce5ff9f40d198b473f78ebce8d2d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e71bce5ff9f40d198b473f78ebce8d2d.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T16:36:13+00:00","modified":"2020-04-08T15:08:06+00:00","filename":"e71bce5ff9f40d198b473f78ebce8d2d.jpg","authentication":"d632a3a7f8540480a1188279122cf224","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_097_011_002_o2.jpg","size":1139252,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

Although we have no regularly organized [?], have no church, and for a very long time have had no preaching, the few Universalists who are now here, have induced the Reverend A.D. Mayo to come and make an effort to establish a society. he is to commence at \"Concert Hall\" next Sunday, so you see we are hereafter to enjoy the privilege of attending church of our own.

Kendall\nDear Sir, \nI was pleased to receive your letter of 27th of August for your words in approbation of past conduct, and encouragement to future exertions I am much obliged.  You reminded me of the necessity of energetic labour and perseverance in overcoming obstacles to insure success in life- of this I have often been before reminded and I have ever endeavored to keep it in mind.  It is worthy of being repeated a thousand times, for the benefit of youth.  While I acknowledge this as true, I hope I do not fail to appreciate the value of a knowledge of this truth. I wish that every boy and girl could understand and feel the same.  Your kind advice to be careful of my health, I shall endeavor to follow. It is now much better than it has been.  You requested me to give you a history of Cleveland I am glad you spoke of it for I had not before thought to inform myself upon this subject- a matter which ought to be of considerable interest to me, since we have pretty much concluded to make of this place a permanent home.  If it would be of any interest to you, I can give you a few of the most important statistics.  The first landing in Cleveland for purpose of settlement was in the Autumn of 1776, in 1810 Cleveland was made the county seat of Cuyahoga County.  In 1814 it was incorporated with a village charter.  in 1816 first church organized; in 1834 the principal streets were graded; in 1835 a large portion of the business part of city burned.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43200,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43200","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/93c85c5f6ec6735edaa1a47b92bf236e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/93c85c5f6ec6735edaa1a47b92bf236e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/93c85c5f6ec6735edaa1a47b92bf236e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/93c85c5f6ec6735edaa1a47b92bf236e.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T16:36:54+00:00","modified":"2020-04-08T19:08:29+00:00","filename":"93c85c5f6ec6735edaa1a47b92bf236e.jpg","authentication":"c863f85bfebe2a743e401fcd4109b64c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_097_016_002_o2.jpg","size":1247130,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2886,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04001212751212800122768697974606766365468502044677734375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["052634"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["052634"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["052634"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"93c85c5f6ec6735edaa1a47b92bf236e.jpg","FileDateTime":1509467682,"FileSize":1247130,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2886\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2886,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:09 13:59:45","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025000000000000001387778780781445675529539585113525390625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 05:26:34","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 05:26:34","ShutterSpeedValue":5.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":51,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3016,"ExifImageLength":3762,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":188,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/188","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"in 1836 raised to rank of a city Queen City of Lake Erie named after Moses Cleveland a graduate of Yale College the following table exhibits the population of Cleveland of different periods of its history population in 1796 was 3 do  1798  16. do  1825  500. do  1831  1,100. do 1835 5,080 do  1840 6071. do  1845 9,573  do 1850  17,600 do  1851  21,140, do 1852 25,670, Last Spring Ohio City was annexed to Cleveland making a population of around 40 to 50,000 at this time.

I have not heard from any of the Institute scholars expecting Helen [Reigner?].  The\u00a0? the friends are all well.  I did think of visiting M---a this Autumn, but guess (a Yankee expression) I will have to give it up.  We should like very much to have you visit us.  Come and spend the Sabbath, although our S. School is not as large as it has been, yet still we have a very pleasant school.  Mr. Bacon I should like to have you become better acquainted with, you must come so as to spend three or four days with us and we will try to make your visit agreeable.  But it is growing late and I must close, hoping to meet you ere long face to face.  Your aff. friend Mary E.

I have never seen any \"manifestations\" but have heard many of my friends who have, speak of them, tell some very wonderful things. Like you, I cannot think it is anything which originates in the \"Spirit Land\" & yet it cannot account for the phenomena.\n\n  I had a very pleasant visit in the city. Called on Hannah Wills, found her well & happy. I spent all my time with Alice. She is getting along very well with her studies & does not confine herself too much, I think. Have you heard anything of the new school in contemplation, near Oxford,Co. It is to be on the same plan of the school at Mt. Holyoke in Conn. or  Map. (I forget which state) the household work being all done by the students thus rendering it much cheaper, the tuition, board, all being on 60 dollars. I have hear several speak of it very favorably. It is to commence next September & by that time the cars will drive from here past it. If they carry out every plan which the circular speaks of it will be a good school & I should like to have Roeilla & Amy go.\n                       Rec'd a letter from Helen Reigner Christms. She writes an excellent letter & I enjoy corresponding with her very much. In her last she speaks of the death of one of her intimate friends, Emily. Indeed, also two of her cousins, young ladies of theirs: In speaking of their death she quotes some lines from Mrs. Hermans which are very pretty, I think, but do not remember of seeing them before. \n\n\"Leaves have their time to fall,\nStars have their time to set\nBut thou, hast all seasons for thy own, O Death\"","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43219,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43219","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d6f9de757fe02f8ae63432251483d71f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d6f9de757fe02f8ae63432251483d71f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d6f9de757fe02f8ae63432251483d71f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d6f9de757fe02f8ae63432251483d71f.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T16:37:57+00:00","modified":"2020-04-10T17:17:58+00:00","filename":"d6f9de757fe02f8ae63432251483d71f.jpg","authentication":"044bf677ee22c58c2724de1d507aa904","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_098_003_001_o2.jpg","size":1429875,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2889,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04582756432444899663547488444237387739121913909912109375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["052847"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["052847"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["052847"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d6f9de757fe02f8ae63432251483d71f.jpg","FileDateTime":1509467682,"FileSize":1429875,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2889\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2889,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:09 14:00:39","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025000000000000001387778780781445675529539585113525390625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 05:28:47","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 05:28:47","ShutterSpeedValue":5.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2491,"ExifImageLength":3103,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":188,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/188","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"which ascertain how much good there is in us\" How often does some little trouble make us feel rebellious and discontented, when suddenly something greater, something that is really an affliction falls upon us & then we can see how wrong we have felt.

Still I cannot but feel that the future usefulness and success of every individual, depends more fully upon the path he selects on entering this broad field of labor than upon any decision he is therefore called to make, at least if he has previously determined to live a life of integrity and faithfulness. He knows not whether he is the best fitted for this or that calling. He knows of no business or profession in which some individuals have not been successful, while other have utterly failed. not only as regarded their own good, but the good of those around them. Hence, though very hopeful, they are extremely doubtful and uncertain as to the \"better way.\" But perhaps in this I am calling on more of my own individual experience, than would be allowed as proof of a general rule. But tell me, is my experience an exception? If not, perhaps thy kindly sympathy and forbearance will invent for me an excuse for this apparent indifference and long delay.

When I came we felt there was only a mere change for us to raise him from his feeble state.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43228,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43228","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f8636786db15e368e4a7ef645c91f7b5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f8636786db15e368e4a7ef645c91f7b5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f8636786db15e368e4a7ef645c91f7b5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f8636786db15e368e4a7ef645c91f7b5.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T16:38:29+00:00","modified":"2020-04-10T21:25:00+00:00","filename":"f8636786db15e368e4a7ef645c91f7b5.jpg","authentication":"99d72a1993f9ec42fb8fd63821108f92","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_098_005_004_o2.jpg","size":1617327,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3600,"resolution_y":2868,"compression_ratio":0.05221495815899600267950830811969353817403316497802734375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["052949"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["052949"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["052949"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f8636786db15e368e4a7ef645c91f7b5.jpg","FileDateTime":1509467683,"FileSize":1617327,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3600\" height=\"2868\"","Height":2868,"Width":3600,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"23mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:09 14:01:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025000000000000001387778780781445675529539585113525390625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 05:29:49","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 05:29:49","ShutterSpeedValue":5.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":77,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3777,"ExifImageLength":3010,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":188,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/188","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"But the \"Great Physician\" came to our aid, and by the blessed influences of His power attending us, our efforts ever successful, and he still lives. He is not quite well again but is comfortable and we trust will soon regain his health.  Grandmother \"withers\" but slowly for her weight continues at nearly two hundred.  She is, however, well and happy.  My mother dear still glides around this house with light elastic step, notwithstanding her labor and care have for a few years past been far greater than woman ought be called to bear. Her whole desire is for the good of her children, and for them she'll surely toil while yet her strength holds out. May they not forget the great debt due the parents who have so fondly and faithfully nourished them.  As regards [?], I've very much I'd like to say to thee, but as my sheet is nearly filled.  I must abridge and say all in as few words as possible.  It may excite they surprise, my friend, when I tell thee that my teaching days are over.  The experience of the past year has all to do with this conclusion.  When I left my school a year ago, it was my intention to enter very soon upon a course of study preparatory to entering Brown University in the fall. After being at home a short time, I found that father's health was very poor, and for several weeks he was not able to attend to his customary duties.  I could not feel justified in leaving him to labor alone in feeble health and concluded to remain at home for a time.  In September  I went to Providence and found that by close application and being very economical of my time.  I could before the year was out, stand even with others of the entering class, Ere I was fairly started in carrying out this plan I was sent for an account of father's sickness and it being necessary that I should remain at home several weeks, my [coll?] arrangements were entirely broken up not as much from a want of courage as from a feeling that such would be the wiser part and gave up the idea of a college course, since which time, my desire to make teaching my profession, has so much diminished that I have finally decided to have it out of account entirely and get into business as soon as possible.  I am thinking much of the western country. Were it not that my means are very limited, and that I am compelled to practice strict economy, I should travel through the west and try to decide for myself, upon a desirable location, the kind of business I should like to follow etc., etc. As I must deny myself this privilege and pleasure, I would ask thy worthy counsel and advice with regard to my turning my course westward.  Do you consider the west the place for a young man of limited means for all N.E.?  What [?] of the west do you think the most desirable as regards health and enterprise?  What course for obtaining a desirable situation do you recommend? About the kind of labor I am not particular except that it be lucrative and does not conflict with principles of honor and right.  I shall desire upon some course very soon therefore a few lines soon received [?] will meet the most grateful regard of thy friend, Hyman A.

But, that this spiritual birth is gradual, it does not expand at once, that it takes a long time to conquer all the evil passions which will rise (as a test of our strength) to have perfect Faith in God, to love our neighbor as oneself, & to do \nrighteousness. He told us, if we do not, adopt & practice the principles of truth & righteousness taught by Jesus Christ, we cannot enjoy the \"kingdom of God.\" I also went to hear Mr. Black, last evening a Cumberland\/Presbyterian minister, a talented man & one that I like very much. Although some parts of his sermon, were in opposition to my views, yet with most of it I was pleased. He first spoke of tenacity of our religious sentiments, of the importance of establishing in the mind some system of religion which would have as much truth in it - as comes within the range of the human mind, that we should search the Scriptures to indoctrinate the mind with the knowledge of the will of God, to form & fashion our character from Their teachings and that a correct knowledge of the Father is eternal life & happiness that we show to the world by our example, the purity of our religion. That This would be an argument that is irresistible. He said that there should more liberality in the church of Christ. There was too much of the spirit of bigotry & predjudice among Christians, too much unwillingness to \"try their Faith & see whether it be good\". He said a great many other good things, but as I am coming near the end of my sheet - I will close this.\n\n             Mr. Bacon thinks of leaving us next month. We are very sorry to part with him.

To the Sunday L. especially has he endeared himself * last Sabbath when he spoke of leaving us. You should have seen how sad the little girls looked, & several came to me after church \"Why, what makes Mr. Bacon go away? There is in our society as in every one I believe, those that exert a bad influence, & who have been working against Mr. Bacon for sometimes, and although he knows he has many friends, yet- he seems to think it  best for him to leave. These little disturbances always make me feel badly, but I do not know but they are everywhere. Have you read \"Records of Bubbleton Parish\". If you have, you will find some characters in it, which are very like some we have here. It is a work written by some minister \"East\" & will I think do a great deal of good.

We have thought of you much the past summer in our home enjoyments. Our physical enjoyments in the way of simple good living surpassed even the summer you was with us. Our strawberries were abundant, blueberries and blueberry cakes & pudding in great profusion. Graham flour all the time on hand but we needed you here, to make a majority in favor of Graham bread all the time. The season has been propitious to all kinds of products, but apples which we have in small supply. While the physical has been well cared for, the intellectual has not been entirely neglected, about as many books have been read in the family as last summer. I have not read as much for want of time, have read the Lives of the Queens of Henry VIII by Agnes Strickland. Life in Germany by Bruce, parts of other works together with Phrenological & Water Cure Journals, Tribune & Ploughman. Our new charge you may well suppose take some of my time some of my pleasantest hours are spent with our boy in my arms.

Yes Mr. Kendall no one outside of our own family shares so largely in our esteem. Your business must tax your energies to their utmost tension. We do rejoice at your almost unparelled success & prosperity. May our kind Father keep and protect you and make you a pillar in his Church, and a blessing to the world.

Miss Howe takes Harper Magazine, we take the Unitarian Quarterly Journal, Tribune, Water Cure Journal & Sunday School Gazette. besides an abundance of transient papers & magazines. I have read more books this winter than ever before in the same time. Since I have been confined to the house so much, have spent much of my time reading. If we have not improved mentally it has been our own fault. Spiritually, We ought to say as much. Our family worship morning and evening. We prise, and trust it has made us better. Our Sunday School worship has been broken. Mr. Putnam left Petersham 1st Oct. since then we have had various Minister: one a Mr. Jackson from Walpole N.H. has been in our family. We prise him much. - has supplied this pulpit now 10 or 12 Sabbaths, I think. An elderly man and one of large experience, was an Orthodox minister 30 years, is now thoroughly Unitarian, has a well stored mind and knows how to draw from it, to suit every occasion. I think we have profited bu his ministration in our family and from the pulpit. A Mr. DC Normandie from Town, preached for us two Sundays ago. The Parish gave him a call in Dec. he could not accept, as his people would not give him up. Since then a Mr. Bush has preached for us as a candidate, was liked very well but could not be our minister as the salary offered him ($700) was not adequate. Last Sunday & to-day we have had no preaching. Who we shall have to break to us the bread of life is not entirely solved? Ministers are scarce. Mr. Putnam asked a discussion 1st Apr to take place in six mos. The failed in pastoral duties was ever esteemed a good preacher. I have had your request and that of your sister, brought before the Church. It was voted to give you letters, and in the absence of a minister the Officers of the Church should make them out. You will probably get them with this letter.  --------\nPecunniarily, Our gains are slow, but we are making something more than our living. As steady an industry as we practice ought to bring us gain, in many places it would bring us much more than here.

I should have been interested in hearing it, but think it more a duty, to stay at home and write you than attend the Lecture, and further, by staying I furnish conveyance to some of my neighbors who may need the Lecture more than myself. I attended to the matter of those letters as soon as practicable after you was here - our communion was last Sunday, when I thought it a suitable time to bring it before the Church. I spoke with Dea. Willard same day - he informed me that he sent letters to you last winter and it was a matter of record upon the Church-Book but as you had not rec. them Mr. L. would furnish them without any action of the Church. You will find them enclosed. I consulted Doct. Parkhurst in reference to a receipt for pills  same day you left, said he would give me one if I would call at his house: but when I called he had decided not to give me one lest he should do more hurt than good, not knowing the symptoms of the patient so you do not receive one. I have my doubt about their suiting her case. Thus much for the business part of my letter. You don't know how much we enjoy our meetings and minister.

The lightening was blinding, the thunder deafening; the willos beside the creek bent in long sweeping curves, leaves were torn from the trees, and branches of the cotton-woods snapped and fell. Torches which, but a few moments before, were seen moving about neighboring camps were extinguished. The rain struck; it came in horizontal sheets, all the broad world was shut out in the onrush; each raindrop was like the prick of a needle.

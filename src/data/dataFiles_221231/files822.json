Peabody killed. Capt. Wade, Lt. Penfield, Lt. Bramble &amp; Major Powell are killed. Lt. Klingler, Lt. Shurtliffe, Capt. Nichols, Capt. Hoge, Lt. Norris, Capt. Donnelly, and myself wounded. My wound is in the knee but slight. I never left the field but was furnished a horse. For forty hours I was in the centre of a most terrific fire. I may say that I have come out with honor and ere many days pass you will see my name honorably mentioned. Our loss was terrible and out of my company I lost nine killed and eleven wounded. We had the honor of opening the battle and nobly we stood the shock of the vast battle line of the enemy. This continent has never been the scene of such a battle as this and the survivors may well be proud of the scars they wear. For myself I can say that I have seen death in every form but take all I ever saw together does not compare with the hour of this carnage of blood and death.

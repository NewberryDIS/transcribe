Was'nt I vexed with myself when I found you had left one pair here? When you particularly desired me to remind you of them? And Joseph's meal - that was worse than all the rest. He'll have nothing to make bread of. I have put them all together in the firkin, as also the French Grammar - which I suppose he intended to take, - and his gun, which of course he will mourn after, if I do not send it!

I have got a tremendous cold - head ache am so hoarse I can scarcely speak loud. My throat is exceeding sore - haven't got a yarb of any kind in the house. Though I must do something, so I fixed some Flax seed and loaf sugar -guess I'll soak mt feet tonight and be well in the morning. I fear you and Josie have both been cold today, it has been so windy, but I suppose you are safe home by this time, unless Josie had to stop to rest. Wish I could spend the evening with you all at home. I wish I had something more to write but believe I have not, so will put away my paper.

What a stormy day! real driving snow storm this forenoon, and fast rain this afternoon. Samuel read \"Lyell\" to me and fixed his boots, while I mended his coat. This P.M. he is writing to Warren while I scribble to you. I forgot to put your Inkstand in the firkin. Josie, having company, you know, and much else to think of; so I got it ready to send up \"Pa,\" but he could not take it. Samuel says we had better get a good bottle & carry up when we go. I have never seen but three or four of the numerous inkstands you mentioned and most of those I gave to Mr. Crosby's children. There is only one here now. I wrote a little to send by Mr. Furber, but thought it not worth the trouble. Mrs. Crosby is getting better slowly. I wish to know the precise quantity of cord wanted for the Pall Cloth, from tassels I believe - write me, and I will try to get it before I go to Milo . Isaac's things are all ready. Kerchief hemmed and all. What a pity Charles did not bring his hog down sooner, when there was better sleighing and a higher price - butter too has fallen is being brought in in immense quantities, 'tis said. \n                Last night Jane was looking out the window and said there was a great star bigger than all the rest, and had longer prickers too. How I want to see you all, and Charlie too, he must cut a fine figure sawing wood. Mrs. Furber left me a skein of white yarn, so I shall not need any more Mother. Yesterday and last night had bad head and ague ache - took a little more cold I suppose. Soaked my feet and sweated, - fell better today than I have before since you went away.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94706,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94706","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b0e33222e0f47635926c20da01fb2c2f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b0e33222e0f47635926c20da01fb2c2f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b0e33222e0f47635926c20da01fb2c2f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b0e33222e0f47635926c20da01fb2c2f.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:47:25+00:00","modified":"2020-07-04T17:45:29+00:00","filename":"b0e33222e0f47635926c20da01fb2c2f.jpg","authentication":"e607c56d2b52ee3b0c0d6274e592e83c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_23_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1376764,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2820,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0452050170738109990953290662218932993710041046142578125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["041751"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["041751"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["041751"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b0e33222e0f47635926c20da01fb2c2f.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652425,"FileSize":1376764,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2820\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2820,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 16:39:34","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:31 04:17:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:31 04:17:51","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"SubSecTimeOriginal":77,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2798,"ExifImageLength":3571,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"March 14th, Thought I would not tear off the former part this epistle, valueless though it be, but \"continue to proceed on.\" We arrived safely & comfortably home Sat.

I could find no black cord, nor tassels, will sometime go to an Upholsterers & try to get tassels, and will get a skein of worsted as before for cord.\n\n         Frillings for Albina, as I did not set it down, I could not tell how much she told me to get, but thought it was three yd's, though it seems a monstrous pattern for two aprons.

If it was'nt the veritable Charles Harlow! He wished and wished Isaac was here. For my part, I concluded Isaac would \"bless his stars\" that he was not. He came and introduced himself to Samuel, who was chopping wood at the door; \"believed he was Mr. Metcalf's partner in business\" etc. Samuel invited him in - he stopped two hours or so, took dinner, & rode up to Bangor with Samuel. He talked most all the time about Religion, querying about one thing and another etc. He does act very queer. Samuel hardly knew what to make of him. Eliab says he owes him $2.50 and would owe him much more if he would have lent it to him. Yesterday I did \"break the ice\" and go to Sewing Circle at William Bennett's. Enjoyed it very well. Mrs. Jewett pleasant & polite as usual. Hannah Moore \"chock full\" of \"carrying on\" about Mr. Webb & Mr. Dunmore & much jabber about cholera & everything else most. Dysentery with cramps very prevalent now. Dr. Rich says no doubt Cholera will be here again. Third Parish have held divers meetings & have given Mr. Webb a call. Offer him $850, with the privilege of being absent half the time for two years, at ten dollars per sabbath. The Augusta people previously offered 800, only, but would at any rate overbid Bangor if that would make any difference, which Webb says it would not. He has decided to go to Augusta, or rather, people say Prof. Pond has decided to have him go. They want to send a smart man from the Seminary out to Kennebec.

One of Prof. Shepherd's great sermons yester, afternoon - subject sin, its progressive character, results etc. brought in the Rumseller in the course of his sermon, how hardened in sin etc. \"Would build house on the very skulls of those he had ruined?, mingle their bones with the frame work & cement it together with their blood, while the groans of his victims was the music of his apartments etc.\" I have not got it right, but that is the substance.  I have washed your bed blankets today, besides other woolen and a few white clothes, got done, and floors washed a little after twelve. To be sure Samuel \"stood over me\" and helped me all he could - pounded, wrung out the blankets, hung out the clothes etc. so I must not take all the credit to myself. Sewing Circle tomorrow at Mr. Lewis's. All the gentlemen that usually attend meetings as The Hall invited - great jam in the evening.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94715,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94715","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/01a61f05cb9d518185c2321ed84ef990.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/01a61f05cb9d518185c2321ed84ef990.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/01a61f05cb9d518185c2321ed84ef990.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/01a61f05cb9d518185c2321ed84ef990.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:47:36+00:00","modified":"2020-05-22T02:32:43+00:00","filename":"01a61f05cb9d518185c2321ed84ef990.jpg","authentication":"ee87d91fdec9f92087e87c9c95a8b8cf","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_23_004_004_o2.jpg","size":1419691,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2794,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04704827142819299756748563368091708980500698089599609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["041859"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["041859"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["041859"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"01a61f05cb9d518185c2321ed84ef990.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652426,"FileSize":1419691,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2794\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2794,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 16:39:50","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:31 04:18:59","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:31 04:18:59","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2779,"ExifImageLength":3580,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"26th Storms, and I don't go to sewing circle.

I want a letter from some of you. Why don't you write? I wish, if you think of it, when Isaac comes back, you would send me one set of Montgomery's works.

Will Almeda lend me the other Volume of Bunyan, and I will send them both home by the first opportunity., as also his Manual of Peace, which I intended to have returned before now. I am getting through the \"Interior Life\" - Think it  very good book. I think there is no danger of our being too perfect, and I really cannot find as that advocates any more perfection or holiness than the Bible requires. The more I read that, the more I read the Bible, and the longer I love, the more I feel that I ought to try constantly to be holy. - if 'tis right to do right at all, why not to do perfectly right - that is, to try. Yet it does seem as though so much heart evil, as well as outward wrong, could never be subdued, and \"brought into subjection.\" \"Thy grace is sufficient for thee\" is certainly a strengthening promise.

Want to send a letter Monday, so I must write this morning.\nNice good letters have been received from you all at sundry times lately - Apr. 17th, 24th &c. good folks.

With regard to Isaac's labored explanation, dissertation or whatever on health, I can only say that the amount of action of our \"horse stable carpet\" made neither of us sick - By the way he would honor it with a more respectable name, I know, if he should see it. it is really very handsome - every body even Mrs. Thaxter says so. I shall certainly pack it up and carry it to Milo when I go, that you may see it!

We had a fine time coming down, only sorry we did not bring Lute. Stopped two hours at Bradford, most of which time I slept refreshingly on the hard narrow sofa. We were just in time for the stage dinner. Samuel went to the table. I did not - he brought me ham & potatoes, bread, & butter, strawberry and custard pie. I did not feel as well that day as for some previous days - was very tired at night, slept almost all day Sunday, feel quite nicely today. We got here some after five. Jane came with a fine lot of strawberries soon after, and who do you guess next? Charles Harlow, of course! Very glad to see us -very sociable etc. for half an hour or so, then wished to speak alone with Samuel, wanted to borrow five dollars and give good security! He would probably have got it if I had not previously heard of Eliab's trials. I pitied the fellow - to walk away down here to ask such a favor of an almost entire stranger, and be refused too! Albina's bread was good - and quite a blessing to us. I hope you'll think to send my green veil by Lucy. I forgot it. Mrs. Goddard is very sick again with her breast - worse than ever. They feared she would have fits yesterday. I expected it when she came up here that damp morning. I forgot to talk all I intended with Almeda about her bonnet. If I were in her place I would have a black straw, lined with black, if she prefers it to white, trimmed with crepe or ribbon just as she likes, and a plain black lace veil with broad hem - all of which would be very cheap and proper.

I try to help her, but she thinks I can't very well. Mrs. Goddard's sister is fitting her dress today. I am desirous to get it done for her to wear next sabbath, as he other one is somewhat soiled. If Almeda has a fine white skirt which she can send as well as not, perhaps she had better, to wear under her muslin. Am having it cut high outside, lining loose with adging round the tip. Almeda must it think I am extravagant - the child certainly needed another dress here. She & Mr. Temple seemed as pleased to see each other as our brother & sister. He seems to feel very much for the Milo people. I have made Lucy a small plaid, blue gingham apron, looks real pretty. I was much disappointed not to hear Mr. Little's Eulogy on the President today, but it rained. Samuel has engaged with Mr. Hathorne the same as last year. Is at Old Town lots lately, and expects to be more next week. Sat. P.M. Lucy's dress is all done. -sets beautifully. The poor girl has pretty hard work writing letters - she has been so unused to excitement that the company got her all into fidgets the other day. Jane would enjoy just such a spice every day, but Lucy would not endure it much better than I should. They did carry on. I tell Lucy she must try to learn herself to be calm under all circumstances. I had a number more things to say, but the hurry of finishing off Lucy's dress made me forget them. We are going to visit the Seminary some day.

We do not have much of a school, and I am satisfied that Jane would learn more at home than at school, of everything useful at least, and if your teacher has commenced again, I think Lucy had better go home immediately, as she ought to go to school - our school does not keep but a fortnight longer and I would just as lief Jane would not go another day - besides I am as strong and well now, as before I was sick, about, and could do very well with what Jane could help if she did go to school. Lucy and Jane are both good girls - Jane is much better than when school first began - only flighty - but take them both together, my patience is tried sometimes. Lucy tries to do right, and is a real good girl, but Almeda has allowed her to be so slow and puttering, that I fear she will never learn to be really smart and quick about work. It is an utter impossibility for her to hurry on any occasion. Tell Almeda from me that she had better do better with Lissie - of she does not work but an hour in a day, let her move that hour.

I also got ten yds of the above mentioned sheeting for Almeda and five for Albina (just enough for a pair of chemise, and very pretty for it too I think.) should think it would be pretty also for children's nightgowns when bleached. You will find this kind all in one piece - 25 yds. For Albina five yds \/ 4 per yd     .32\n               11 3\/4 yds, 4 cents \" .47\n               11 \"            9 cents ___99\n               3\/4 \" linen, 50 per yd  37 1\/2\n                1 brown table cover       75\n                1 salt cellar                    10\n                                                  $3.00\n\nI could not find any 8 cent sheeting very good. Thought this 9 cent was nice. I put in a bit like what I was making at home for Samuel - you will see it is a min. quality. Thought eleven yds would make Charles two prs of shirts. For Josie's shirts I got 6 yds of the same kind. Ten yds of ,6 1\/4 and a 1\/2 of, 4 for Almeda makes just a dollar, besides which, from her funds I paid the remaining , 30 besides what the stockings pd for the S. Circle. This is a jumbled up mess - don't know as you will understand it.

Thought besure she would come yesterday. no boat today - she must come tomorrow. I suppose you in particular, Mother, will ridicule me greatly, if not burn me in clergy or effigy or something else, when I tell you \"I been sick\" and bint got well yet! I suppose I took cold last Monday, but am sure I don't know how or when. Felt rather foolish after washing & all the evening - and Tuesday morning got up with headache, pain in back and limbs, & for that matter all over, jumping pulse, and dysentery to boot - groaned all night with pain in back and limbs like aching fingers where my cold - been lolling on the sofa about half dressed ever since - slept tolerably last night though I feel better today. Is there such a Thing as inflamation of the Diaphragm?  I have had much severe pain & sounds right across the pit of my stomach - hurt me to cough terribly and to move \"every which way.\" Samuel has made bread two or three times - capital too - and Jane done all the rest of the week, like a woman - every thing in the world she could do for me. & took care nicely.

Micawber, ahem. Well, I will being about I as usual. I am getting along nicely now - gaining strength daily, only I cannot walk. Samuel has carried me out to my meals three days - went out to breakfast this morning - also he carried me out on the piazza Sat. and yesterday, and held me there about five minutes each time - all I have been out of doors yet  - no more Irritable weather. I was poked? into the sitting room yesterday while Ann opened the window & gave my room & bed an airing. Yesterday I knitted almost an inch - first time I have had any work at all - feel enough better today to pay for it - expect to get well surprisingly now! Jane was quite unwell a day or two after Almeda went home - took some oil & is very well now - made it hard for Ann to have us both to wait upon some, and the work to do besides. Her back is weak & troubles her, but I think if Jane is well, she will get along easier in future. Jane has been so turned about for a few weeks, that she is hardly herself, but will come round again soon I think. Almeda did not seem well at all for two or three days before she went home. I am afraid she worked too hard & got too tired here. I suppose I must not write any more now. Be kissed & loved, all of you, for me. Do write to us - good bye - Lucy.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94771,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94771","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4aae5acc31d060fb9f733b571434c023.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4aae5acc31d060fb9f733b571434c023.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4aae5acc31d060fb9f733b571434c023.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4aae5acc31d060fb9f733b571434c023.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:48:51+00:00","modified":"2020-05-27T03:08:21+00:00","filename":"4aae5acc31d060fb9f733b571434c023.jpg","authentication":"9523058c25851ba4de7f0e9487a775bd","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_23_023_002_o2.jpg","size":1056683,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2815,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.034757022564304997092055060647908248938620090484619140625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["042622"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["042622"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["042622"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4aae5acc31d060fb9f733b571434c023.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652429,"FileSize":1056683,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2815\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2815,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 16:41:40","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:31 04:26:22","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:31 04:26:22","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2808,"ExifImageLength":3591,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Much obliged to Almeda for being so thoughtful & prompt about the liniment -

Coronation cord, one stick six cents; please return the other form. 13 1\/2 yds of the gingham - just what there was in the peice. Thread I have forgotten, will ask Samuel. I send pattern of sun bonnet - just like Jane's I think. If not right, you can alter it. Pantalettes, peices of dress etc., like Jane's old dresses, for Almerda.\n\n                             Lissie Doe decided to go and see Ann, and go the rest of her journey alone.

He finds no prospect of employment on the Hartford & Fishkill R.R. and is going on farther - thought it probable he might be in Westfield this week and wished us to write to him there.

The largest fire there has been for some years = six dwelling houses Eastes' & Whittese's store foundry besides several shops, and with great difficulty saved the Universalist Meeting house. The lower side is black from top to bottom. Cleared all out on the lower part of Baptist hill and Exchange street. Very high wind so that roofs of houses caught fire many times way up State St. most half a mile. broke out again in the night and burnt a brick stable belonging to, and joining the Hammet house,","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94789,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94789","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b6415557a8b507780ca2bbe16db93edc.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b6415557a8b507780ca2bbe16db93edc.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b6415557a8b507780ca2bbe16db93edc.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b6415557a8b507780ca2bbe16db93edc.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:49:15+00:00","modified":"2020-05-28T17:46:43+00:00","filename":"b6415557a8b507780ca2bbe16db93edc.jpg","authentication":"52a06b0e8c858103c4a3a88d4aaabdbc","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_24_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1294129,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2860,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04189746827246799976141033994281315244734287261962890625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001400"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001400"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001400"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b6415557a8b507780ca2bbe16db93edc.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652429,"FileSize":1294129,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2860\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2860,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 09:54:13","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:01 00:14:00","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:01 00:14:00","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2923,"ExifImageLength":3679,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"in one tenement of which Mrs. Griffin, sister to Mrs Dr. Shepherd of Sebec, abides.

We conclude on the whole it is a tolerable decent kind of a place - better than we expected. We have really a nice boarding place. The most neat and quiet little place that you can imagine, overlooking this \"N.W.

She is shopping all the time - getting all sorts of nice things. She popped in quite unexpectedly last Tuesday. Mother had gone to Mrs. Brown's to dinner, by special invitation, to meet Mrs. Lee. Mr. and Mrs. Lee came home with her and spent the night. I was invited to Mrs. Brown's too, but would'nt go because Samuel was not asked!\n  Samuel is getting along nicely now - his appetite is good and he gains strength finely since he has done sweating nights. We only staid at Deer Isle five days. Samuel went to the salt water, got chilly, and brought his fever again so we had to have the doctor four or five times. So we thought best to get home just as soon as he felt able to come. I think the sea air & bathing would have benefited me if we had staid longer & I had not been so tired and anxious about him all the time. Went Wednes. & back the next Mond. Cost us $15.00 Yesterday afternoon we all went to Hampden & Mrs. Crosby's.

Mother keeps threatening to go home, but I don't see how I can get along without her. I send a pr. of chemise for Jane, don't know how they will fit. Mr. Tibbits is boarding here now finishing his house. I am afraid Samuel will go into the woods again & I suppose he ought to, if he has a good chance. I wish I could be well enough to get along this winter with Jane & not hire a girl. Mother says she shall go down street again one of these days. I will get baby's apron at Charley's waist. Mrs. Stat.? Harlow died last sabbath. She had been sick a long time, but her death was quite sudden at last. His fourth wife. Guess I must lie down now. good bye\n\n                                                                                                                                                                       Lucy.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94802,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94802","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ca94ff9080b0ad1bec16550b5e3392c7.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ca94ff9080b0ad1bec16550b5e3392c7.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ca94ff9080b0ad1bec16550b5e3392c7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ca94ff9080b0ad1bec16550b5e3392c7.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:49:33+00:00","modified":"2020-07-04T18:09:30+00:00","filename":"ca94ff9080b0ad1bec16550b5e3392c7.jpg","authentication":"f052aa57286ebedbe89da6fe609869b3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_24_008_001_o2.jpg","size":1313048,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2867,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0424061801599300014498084010483580641448497772216796875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001610"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001610"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001610"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ca94ff9080b0ad1bec16550b5e3392c7.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652430,"FileSize":1313048,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2867\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2867,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 09:54:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:01 00:16:10","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:01 00:16:10","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2895,"ExifImageLength":3635,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Bangor Oct. 11 1851\n\n                                                                                                                           Bangor Oct. 11 - 1851.\n\nDear Mother\n\n                                 I will begin a letter to you because I feel like it, though I have nothing particular to write.

I guess he meant Samuel should have the land at any rate, for he came down from $508. to $400. willingly. and when Samuel told him he could'nt give more than four hundred, and should have to look further said \"Well Mr. Furber, you may have the land for just what you have a mind to pay me - but did not wish to have anything said about it! He and \"Tib\" and myself spend our leisure time drafting now-a-days. Mr. Tibbits keeps drawing plans of divers sorts with quirks and crooks in them. He says he wants a job, and Samuel knows the expense of one of these little plain houses too well! Our neighbors, the frogs took a long leap yesterday - way over the river. In other words, Mr. Fogg has moved over the other side, on Lincoln St. Mr. Lincoln has taken the Flour and Onions, and has been paid for the same.The basket etc. said he would take next time.

So any thin material of any sort that nobody else wants for rugs or anything else, you may save for one.

What did you trim Lucy's with? What is Lissy going to have? I think you had better send us a firkin of butter, and let me keep the firkin this winter if you have one to spare. We use a good deal of butter now, more than when we have plenty of milk, you know. Weigh out a firkin full of lumps & send by first opportunity.

Samuel thinks some of going to Milo in a week or two, to collect money of Owen, - he says, too, he wants to see the old place. I should think he would want to go before snow comes.

He want to see Mr. One, and unless he gets a letter from him today, may go. Eliab had a letter from Ann yesterday. No news except that Argyle P. Rumsey took Bliss (The name of his wife) to himself very unexpectedly to see his friends a few days since. She gives Eliab lots of good advice about \"Susan\" etc.etc. I have had a \"pull back\" for a few days - feel better today. I cannot imagine the cause, but my back gave out all at once. It was as much as I could well do to get across the room.\n   Frances says she wants to go home before Thanksgiving, which you know, is the 27 - of this month. So please to hasten your decision that I may not be left without any help. Eliab thinks that unless he makes a trade with Brown to go back there, he shall go west very soon. Then, if expedient, we can turn \"Tib\" away, so as to have a small family. I suppose he will be more likely to let us have the house, and at reasonable rent, if he can stay here - it will be very convenient to live so near Milo \"our house\" is building. Please to write soon your conclusions upon all these matters. Is Albina going to send us a good lot of butter? I do so much\n\n[left-hand side] Good bye Mother & all the rest. shall write you a long letter as soon as I can find a place at which to date it.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94813,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94813","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d05585403d18f562bd085f70cc0bd60b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d05585403d18f562bd085f70cc0bd60b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d05585403d18f562bd085f70cc0bd60b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d05585403d18f562bd085f70cc0bd60b.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:49:48+00:00","modified":"2020-05-29T16:23:51+00:00","filename":"d05585403d18f562bd085f70cc0bd60b.jpg","authentication":"306294ddf62e0fb578b272eb4a0eef67","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_24_011_002_o2.jpg","size":1343223,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2856,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.043547794117646997091863880768869421444833278656005859375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001740"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001740"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001740"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d05585403d18f562bd085f70cc0bd60b.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652431,"FileSize":1343223,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2856\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2856,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 09:55:06","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:01 00:17:40","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:01 00:17:40","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2895,"ExifImageLength":3649,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"want to arrange matters so that I can go to Milo to Thanksgiving, but I fear it will not be expedient.

Mr. Tebbits is over at work on the \"Pendle-pant's\" house.\n                       Three good surveyors are \"out of the market\" - (one gone to selling rum - the only licensed rumseller in Bangor) one moved to Boston, and one sick, so there is a great demand for surveyors, now just as the river is shutting up, and everybody is in a hurry to get their lumber surveyed and the vessels sent off. Divers people are after Samuel. The surveyor general is very anxious for Samuel to take hold and help this fall, but won't give him a commission for another year. I tell him I would'nt do a thing now in the coldest most uncomfortable part of the whole season, unless he would let one survey next year. Samuel says he could probably make six or seven dollars a day till the river freezes. So he surveys some, and stays at the mill some.                     \n                     Well I am looking to see Mother, Jane and Charlie this week. What a time! Don't disappoint me now, will you?

The April numbers are here, ready, waiting for an opportunity to send them. If you would just ask Mr. Smith to call when he is down - it would be both a pleasure to us to see him, and a convenience to send by him. Lucy seems to get along well and like her school.

One man a Mr. Holman who lives in Hampden, sold last summer $$0 worth of thimbleberries (we had one box of them) all raised on a piece of ground but little if any bigger than your house & land upon.

It is a beautiful place there - improvements every year.\n                      With regard to Mother's going home, she wants I should say something. Of course it would be greatly for my happiness to have her stay here always, but I do not want to be selfish about it. I cannot feel willing that she should stay and continue to do the work here. It has been as much as she ought to do all winter, and in the warm weather it will of course be more fatiguing. We are now taking immediate measures to get a girl. I am on the track of a good one here, but may not get her. I wish you would ascertain where Frances is, and whether she would come if wanted, and if you hear of any other good girl please inform me. I am going to get a girl just as soon as I can. Then Mother will be at liberty  as far as I am concerned, to make you good folks a visit & come back again, or to stay there; just as she can best enjoy herself. I percieve her heart yearns to be with the grandchildren, but as there is one of them here, I tell her she ought to stay here some. She, of course, must decide according to her own inclination. She don't seem to know whether she wants to be here or there when Ann and Isaac come.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94823,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94823","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c1b93af3542406857cb7c8593f01a626.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c1b93af3542406857cb7c8593f01a626.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c1b93af3542406857cb7c8593f01a626.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c1b93af3542406857cb7c8593f01a626.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:50:02+00:00","modified":"2020-05-29T18:30:57+00:00","filename":"c1b93af3542406857cb7c8593f01a626.jpg","authentication":"b6b95e3ad992c7d696500a0c9b336ce1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_25_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1376074,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2832,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0449909107553879972218879856882267631590366363525390625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001915"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001915"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001915"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c1b93af3542406857cb7c8593f01a626.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652431,"FileSize":1376074,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2832\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2832,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 09:55:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:01 00:19:15","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:01 00:19:15","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"SubSecTimeOriginal":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2882,"ExifImageLength":3663,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"For myself, I want to be in both places - don't know but I shall divide on that \"'portant 'casion.\"!

I think I could get along with the work but the so constant care is sometimes a burden - we have breakfast ready at half past five - write whether you and Lis could come and carry me home at the of a fortnight or 3 weeks if I should write to you that I want to go I cannot tell yet, you know, whether or when","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94826,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94826","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/96614f358c57b6b53f54d589926a94b3.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/96614f358c57b6b53f54d589926a94b3.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/96614f358c57b6b53f54d589926a94b3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/96614f358c57b6b53f54d589926a94b3.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:50:06+00:00","modified":"2020-05-29T21:44:27+00:00","filename":"96614f358c57b6b53f54d589926a94b3.jpg","authentication":"e57f6931b88a0faae7aa687eb9f1f142","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_25_003_001_o2.jpg","size":1648139,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2895,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05271345870914100062432083859675913117825984954833984375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001931"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001931"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001931"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"96614f358c57b6b53f54d589926a94b3.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652431,"FileSize":1648139,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2895\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2895,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 09:55:38","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:01 00:19:31","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:01 00:19:31","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2928,"ExifImageLength":3640,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Bangor June 21, 1852\n\n                                                                                                                                   Bangor June 21 1852\n\nDear Brother & Sisters\n\n                                Mother did not think of going home today, but has concluded to wait till Wednesday & so I will write a few words, though I have not much to say.

I am very doubtful, Charles, whether Charlie will on the whole be benefited by attending school this summer. I do not think children should be sent to school till they are six years old. At home, frolicking about, they are laying in a stock of physical strength and stamina which will give them greater power and strength of intellect by and by, which they will need when they come to the labor of study. I don't believe it is good for their little bodies to be kept so still six hours in a day. How does Lissie prosper, Almeda. I suppose all her Motherlyness is put in requisition to take care of Charlie nowadays. Lucy's school is one week longer - if I get a girl I suppose she will be homeward bound shortly.

We received them graciously. Lucy and Jane trimmed round like women, prepared the \"go to meetin' chamber,\" got things ready for breakfast etc. We had baked veal for dinner yesterday and some slices cold for breakfast with warm potatoes, bread & butter, & doughnuts, all ready by 1\/2 past sic this morning.

He says that my sewing here at home , - more than a hired girl would do, all which is very right and proper, - might amount to fifty cents a week, while the difference at the mill, when he trusts to his men, is nearer a hundred dollars. \n                                       I was particularly gratified with all the items of intelligence contained in \n\n[left-hand side]filled my sheet?

It is 12 o'clock - I must see about dinner - good bye.\n\n                                                                                                                      Daughter Lucy.\n\nI should think C. might do well to get a steady Irish girl, if the right sort could be found it would be good help: or perhaps a man and his wife to work on farm year after year and have a little shanty to live in near by Eliab or Sam'l might perhaps find a chance after a time. I think it quite probable am Irish girl could be got, by trying & you surely must have? some one.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94877,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94877","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/2704f3b9e9a0fc8b24d9a3318da6ce45.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/2704f3b9e9a0fc8b24d9a3318da6ce45.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/2704f3b9e9a0fc8b24d9a3318da6ce45.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2704f3b9e9a0fc8b24d9a3318da6ce45.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:51:17+00:00","modified":"2020-06-02T03:35:35+00:00","filename":"2704f3b9e9a0fc8b24d9a3318da6ce45.jpg","authentication":"e3d8cc14ab10a3b1ccde14ce864e177a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_25_015_004_o2.jpg","size":1414742,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2895,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.045248576728714996753044630395379499532282352447509765625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["002547"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["002547"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["002547"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"2704f3b9e9a0fc8b24d9a3318da6ce45.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652434,"FileSize":1414742,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2895\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2895,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 09:57:25","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:01 00:25:47","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:01 00:25:47","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":44,"SubSecTimeOriginal":47,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2941,"ExifImageLength":3657,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Dear Mrs. Ansthiss\n\n       I remembered that Mrs. Kicher had engag'd to have her Daughter Maria board with you and work for her board which the school keeps.\n\nMaria has been helping me save at week what she could for I have not been able to any other girl and I don't know now where I could get any one.

I hope you will write to him often - we have all written, but in his last he said he had recieved no letter yet. How soon is Charles coming? It seems to me if Anne stays here this winter, you ought to be here too, as she may go away in the spring, and you not have so good a time to be with her again very soon. Samuel is going to have a horse and ? this winter, so I guess Anne and I will occasionally take passage with him as far as Milo and Brownville when he goes into the woods.

Haskins, whom I think you saw him riding with Eliab once. We invited Prof. Shepard & wife Mr. & Mes. Jewett, Henry Brown, Mr. & Mrs. Haskins with their brother & Miss Jenks. The five first mentioned came not - Mr. Jenks was obliged to go away, Mr. Brown had a cold and Mr. Shepard's little boy had the croup. Mr. S. acted the gentleman by calling over yesterday to tell us, as he said, why they treated us so shabbily. They will come & spend an evening soon. We bought an extension table & a stuffed racking chair for the occasion, borrowed a dozen tea spoons & 1\/2 a do. chairs, had splendid success with every article of cookery. The table looked beautifully. Even Eliab, the fastidious & the connoisseur, was unable to find any fault with the arrangements. We had tea & coffee, both excellent, good bread, some of Albina's good butter, & cut the largest cheese, which is really superb, quince preserve nice sugar gingerbread, cup cake in hearts of rounds, currant cake frosted, and jelly cake which last was perfectly elegant as Mrs. Shepherd would say - and Mrs. Haskins the \"au fait\", did not know how to break it, which mortified her extremely & forcibly reminded us of the night when Sarah Harlow took tea here! Besides we had some nice custards in the new egg glasses which Samuel bought of auction the other  day, with apple jelly under the custard.

We bought a firkin of butter recently, very ? in stamped lumps (50 pounds) but shall probably want some more. We have also bought a quarter of beef - wish we had not, so I think likely yours is better, though this is good - a far cow four years old. Apples I judge are pretty cheap everywhere this year.

I feel anxious to hear about her cold - am afraid she took more standing out by the carraige, I hope you will get the wool picked and all your matters attended to before many weeks so as to come down here. S.C. Thurston has gone to Carlostine Jewett's to board. Hannah Moore has got homesick at Wisconsin - has returned to N.Y. Her brother at California died a short time since. Isaac, I shall depend upon your coming to stay a nice while with me - you never did make me much of a visit. I should think, too, you had rather be here some. so as to know what is going on. I must finish this to send to the office when the folks go to meeting. Do please all write often. Cannot Charles & Albina ever squeese out a letter to me? Affectionately Lucy.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94905,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94905","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/06ccbadca6ecc1fc7c9f022da6e22713.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/06ccbadca6ecc1fc7c9f022da6e22713.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/06ccbadca6ecc1fc7c9f022da6e22713.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/06ccbadca6ecc1fc7c9f022da6e22713.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:51:58+00:00","modified":"2020-06-03T05:10:29+00:00","filename":"06ccbadca6ecc1fc7c9f022da6e22713.jpg","authentication":"88c0b1a08add69cf8b3f18082d498181","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_26_004_004_o2.jpg","size":1157455,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2811,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.038125848188992998710755699676155927591025829315185546875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001233"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001233"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["001233"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"06ccbadca6ecc1fc7c9f022da6e22713.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652435,"FileSize":1157455,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2811\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2811,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 09:53:51","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:01 00:12:33","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:01 00:12:33","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"SubSecTimeOriginal":98,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2834,"ExifImageLength":3629,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I do feel very sorry and bad about Isaac's letter What can be done about it?

I thought you were going to stay longer at Almeda's while Anna was there. Are you going again before she comes from there? Maria has kindly offered to do your shopping (a great amount!) and Almeda's. She sent her bonnet to be colored & trimmed, and wished a veil procured also. Eliab came home last friday - made no purchases - Maria was dear good while he was gone - came almost every day; sewed some, altering a dress for me, and relieved me almost entirely of the care of baby, and for that matter Mrs. Griffith too - she kept him all the time - fed him with checkerberry, catnip and what not. She understand the matter of taking care of babies admirably I assure you. The little Percie is very good most of the time - has a worrying day once in awhile, as yesterday for instance, but is just as good as babies can be today to pay for it. I have not fed him a bit for a number of days, except occasionally a little elder blows or checkerberry for medicine. The elder flower answer nicely for physic. Mrs. Lee said they were good, so I deem it no harm to use them, although she alone of all the many I have consulted in regard to \"sugar rags\" agrees with Mrs. Page - O, yes,\n\n[left-hand side]I thought you were going to stay at Almeda's with Anna, so as to fix that delaine dress right off.

I have written to Isaac and Nettie and to Almeda within a few days - shall write to Anna soon when Jane goes. I wish Anna would write to Maria. What does Charles do with the carraige? Do please to write very often.\nLucy thinks I should write but a little. I have had to read what she has written to avoid repetition. I think that she has pretty nearly gone over the whole ground. Eliab did not purchase the tract of land which he went to see but is negociating for another tract which I think it quite probable he may buy.

Dr. McRuen says there is no hope for Margaret -says the left lung is entirely gone - that she has kept up so long, she will probably sink rapidly. We shall try to ride down there tomorrow morning. Her poor father & Mother, I don't know what I can say to them.\n\n              Samuel has just weighed Percie- eleven weeks old last night - weighs almost fifteen pounds. Ir. Me. called the other day - he says if we both keep on growing we shall be good large folks by and by.

Her sympathies were so much roused for a poor little spanish girl in \n\n[left-hand side and top] and tree, with tow-boats, ropes and hundreds of men - liners, sc? and what not, all to no purpose - the ways were not sufficiently greased. Samuel said. It went off next day but none of us saw it. Owing to neglect in the builders of our church, the large beams 65 feet long were not properly tied together & jarred by the tremendous wind of last Monday night, one beam sprung off two inches letting for flooring timbers & plastering door. Injured many pews & had it been in time of service must have killed many people. It was a sad accident.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94935,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94935","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/cca076ed20f53412f4a145fb7abd1680.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/cca076ed20f53412f4a145fb7abd1680.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/cca076ed20f53412f4a145fb7abd1680.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cca076ed20f53412f4a145fb7abd1680.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T00:52:38+00:00","modified":"2020-06-04T22:53:48+00:00","filename":"cca076ed20f53412f4a145fb7abd1680.jpg","authentication":"803fb040665e322063ad95dcde5abb9e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_26_013_002_o2.jpg","size":1166390,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2816,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.038351943918349999662620319895722786895930767059326171875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["003409"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["003409"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["003409"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cca076ed20f53412f4a145fb7abd1680.jpg","FileDateTime":1586652436,"FileSize":1166390,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2816\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2816,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 09:59:23","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:01 00:34:09","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:01 00:34:09","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":44,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2396,"ExifImageLength":3062,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Cuba that we heard about lately - she said if she had been in this country she should have taken her in a moment - her only fear was of the Spanish temper.

He has been pretty goodnatured, but until yesterday has seemed very much stuffed with phelgm, and hoarse by spells, so that I have not dared to put him down. Sabbath day we put a bandage on his neck & gave him some of his medicine, fearing the croup. I think if I am careful now he will get entirely over it. You say I am too careful, but just as sure as I try to be careless a bit, he takes cold. He had grown poor. The cow came lat night. I hope he will thrive on good new milk. Though for several days he has not taken any  - won't swallow a bit of any kind of food, but is very tenacious of titty! The cow gives a nice mess of milk. Mr. Jordan will take the mornings' milk every day and allow five cents a quart, which is better than we expected to do with it. He has taken back the little cans too.

Mr. H. bequeathed a;; his public documents, such as surveys of Minn. & Utah territories, etc. to Eliab! About 25 bound volumes I believe.

Don't let James and Jane trouble you. I am grieved about them both. I think Sam'l had better make every effort to find a place for Jane. I had a letter from Ann a few days since which I will enclose, also a few envelopes enough to last till Samuel goes up again, when I will send more. Eliab got them for you. We expected Mrs. Palmer to spend the day yesterday, but instead, Mr. & Mrs. Crosby came to dine and Julia Parker to spend the afternoon, all unexpectedly - Julia is a very pleasant girl - good, rather loquacious like her Mother, but the good sense of her father to go with her loquacity.

I only nursed him twelve times last night. He is good only when I know his teeth pain him; but he is just learning to stand and requires a good deal of attention, as you know. He has not had a bad bump yet, though he fell out of the cradle this morning. I was sitting close by it, and he fell partly on me. We have both had a pretty hard time since Isabel went away. There was a good deal to do of fixing up fresh meat etc. (more than I expected when Isabel went away, because of the continued warm weather) and myself being perhaps a little too anxious to get it all done immediately, (which, however, was rather necessary) I \"overdid,\" and consequently got partially \"overrot\"\u00a0; so that Mallie has taken almost the whole charge for several days.

Mallie had a letter from him today, which but for the severe storm, which detained the mail, would have arrived some days since - that was dated in Boston; he was going to leave immediately for New Haven and Bridgeport, Conn. on business - he has had an offer of a very good situation at Ne Haven recently; Samuel is hoping that he will not engage himself any where positively before he returns, as there is an excellent opportunity for them to go into business together here. Samuel will tell you all about it. We expect Eliab home now every day.  I suppose you expected a letter from some of us last week.

Well, they will be here probably all through whatever may take place, summer and fall. I am really very poorly. The complaint has never troubled me so much before. I was weak, and had the injury to my back along with it before, but this has never been so bad; it never troubled me nights before. Now I feel the pain and weakness when in bed, as if I could not get up again. I do walk into the bedroom and kitchen because I cannot help it, and of course have to lift and take care of Percie more or less as best I can, but I am so afraid I shall get fairly down on my back, I don't know what to do.

I shall write to Almeda too, and if she and Albina both send a box, it will not come amiss. If there is more than we want, it can go right into the store. Samuel and Eliab have got a splendid store. The largest and best arranged store, wharf and counting room in the city. Their counting room in particular is very pleasant. Very high, with large windows coming almost to the floor on three sides, a large, handsome and convenient desk, clock, looking glass, table of books, papers etc. They will have to negotiate some, as Sam'l says in order to meet their notes, for a while, but think it is a good business, and an excellent situation, and that they can carry it through safely.

I have another girl engaged to come next day, but on engaging found her character was not good and have been without, except while Katy McLaughlin, who helps nicely about the care of Baby. But we are in a bad fix and must have help. Percie had a touch of croup the night after Isabel went away, so that had added to the care. He took cold when Katy had him out. I expected a girl today, (Irish) but she has not come.\n                         We think now of doing without till we go to Milo ad trying to hunt up one there or at Brownville. Nettie and I have some idea of going up before Anna comes, as I cannot go there; (there will be fatigue & excitement enough without) perhaps last of this week or first of next, if  Samuel cam leave to go with us. I think you may expect us. Mallie and Eliab will keep house. How does Almeda's lounge prosper? I will tell you about Isabel when I come.

Last evening Mr. & Mrs. Shepard, their oldest daughter & Mr. Egbert Smythe, (who now preaches 1\/2 time for us,) took tea here, tomorrow we feel obliged to invite Mr. Harlow's family & Mrs. Blood -we wanted to wait till you came, but have been nowhere hardly with Nettie & had no company & wanted to have them before she went home. We hired washing & ironing this week. Nettie send much love - says she feels wicked to go away without seeing you more, as she expected. I hope to have a little good time now I have got a girl that can keep the fire going without my telling her every time to put it a stick ?\nWell I am tired - much love - good bye\n\n                                             Lucy","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":95006,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/95006","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/68a64083db8f8257971c15fd51a14473.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/68a64083db8f8257971c15fd51a14473.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/68a64083db8f8257971c15fd51a14473.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/68a64083db8f8257971c15fd51a14473.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-12T01:02:27+00:00","modified":"2020-06-06T17:40:21+00:00","filename":"68a64083db8f8257971c15fd51a14473.jpg","authentication":"69cf4b4a08b079f32cdc2240d9285b4a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_27_001_001_o2.jpg","size":950979,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2256,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.039030855988968000958028170543911983259022235870361328125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["004406"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["004406"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180601"],"TimeCreated":["004406"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"68a64083db8f8257971c15fd51a14473.jpg","FileDateTime":1586653299,"FileSize":950979,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2256\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2256,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:08 10:01:56","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:06:01 00:44:06","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:06:01 00:44:06","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":44,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1910,"ExifImageLength":3047,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1216,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1216","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Bangor March 14, 1855.\n\nDear Mother , Nettie and all\n\n                             A letter to either of you is the same as to all, especially if I write pretty often.

If they reuse, said he should \"throw her across the town of Dover and leave her.\" I feel no little anxiety to know the result of his journey. If we get fairly rid of her, shall we not feel relieved, and yet uncomfortable thoughts of her will always intrude themselves upon us. Do you believe we shall ever take another Hobbs to bring up? Hattie and Mary expect to go this week - they would have gone today had Mary been well enough. If Sam'l should go to Norfolk (which I do not expect) perhaps we should make one family either here or at Eliab's, as she would be alone so much and S. would be away three weeks probably.

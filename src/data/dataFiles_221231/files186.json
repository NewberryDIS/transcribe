Jam 29th 1846\n\nMr. Kendall, Sir,\n\n                                   Last Sabbath morn, my heart was made glad by the sight of another token of your regard for me. It ever gives me pleasure to hear from friends & acquaintances, especially those who have rendered themselves dear to me by repeated acts of kindness. It is good to have friends, who who, we can in confidence to communicate our joys & our griefs; who will sympathize with us in our sorrows & rejoice with us in our happiness.\n              You mention the death of your brother. May God comfort you in your affliction. It seems hard to part with those we love, yet, thank God I have never been called to part (by death) with any of mine, except my Grandfather, since I was six years of age.\n         You seem to be not at all sparing of compliments but, I am fearful that I am not deserving of so much. With regard to climbing that \"hill,\" I must sat, that my progress   --if I make any, --- is very slow. If I look onward, \"the top of the hill, & the temple of Truth,\" appear as far distant as ever; - if I look back, I can see that I have advanced a little. I am determined, however, not to turn aside or go back. As to \"Pleasure,\" in what can it be had, if not in this, if \"Virtue accompany is? I may yet get lost, in the mazes of \"Ignorance,\" or bound in her \"chains\" or I may yet","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42770,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/42770","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/45a056dbbf9459967c91bf533e5e22a4.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/45a056dbbf9459967c91bf533e5e22a4.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/45a056dbbf9459967c91bf533e5e22a4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/45a056dbbf9459967c91bf533e5e22a4.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:36:47+00:00","modified":"2020-04-27T04:29:27+00:00","filename":"45a056dbbf9459967c91bf533e5e22a4.jpg","authentication":"66f5289adc2f63a98eed7727d94a1c69","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_088_009_002_o2.jpg","size":1751524,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2836,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0571855247348899975445846166621777229011058807373046875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["021701"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["021701"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["021701"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"45a056dbbf9459967c91bf533e5e22a4.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460516,"FileSize":1751524,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2836\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2836,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:01:03","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025000000000000001387778780781445675529539585113525390625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:17:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:17:01","ShutterSpeedValue":5.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3327,"ExifImageLength":4222,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"go down the stream of \"Insignificance\" and be buried in the gulf of Oblivion; but if I do, I promise you it shall not be in consequence of \"Indolence.\" Yet, let is always bear in mind that \"Science may raise one to eminence; but Virtue alone can ensure us felicity.\" May we, I say bear this in mind & let virtue be our constant companion.\n\n            Please - accept my thanks for the solution of that problem.  The moment I cast my eye on it, I saw at a glance the rock on which I hung, and when I saw your first supposition, I took my slate and worked it through, before tracing yours through. In my former trials I had x equal one term, then when I added them together there were two unknown quantities in the equation. I then tried to work it by substituting the value of X, for X. but on multiplying together it produced an equation, which in my present stage of Algebraic knowledge I could not reduce, (if it can be reduced), at all. It never occurred to me (yo will wonder at my dullness) that X could be anything else. Since I wrote you before, my health would not admit of my performing any more labor, either bodily or mental, than my school required, of course I have not done much with Algebra.

             I received yours with joy & thankfulness, as it not only informed me that you were well & doing well, but bu it I see that you are still regardful of me. I was glad to hear that you had got into a place where you will have some help, as it is hard for a teacher to drag the school along with him when the parents are hanging back.   You will conclude from the date of this. that I am not at home, --that is true, -- I feel that I am not at home.  I closed my school there Saturday, Jan. 9.  You know the circumstances which existed before I commenced, and what was apprehended, but on entering the school I found that such feelings did not extend to the scholars. Everything has gone off harmoniously & as far as  I know, to the perfect satisfaction of all concerned. The interest manifested by the scholars, their deportment and their progress were truly gratifying to me. Nothing better could have been required in any aspect. The parents, too, have done more than I expected. I believe I told you before, what had been done by getting of books, for the children, and in addition 20 visits from the parents, --more than all I ever knew before in this district.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42788,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/42788","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/cf06c261c2f9df2fe45744669304e8bb.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/cf06c261c2f9df2fe45744669304e8bb.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/cf06c261c2f9df2fe45744669304e8bb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cf06c261c2f9df2fe45744669304e8bb.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:37:48+00:00","modified":"2020-04-28T03:07:54+00:00","filename":"cf06c261c2f9df2fe45744669304e8bb.jpg","authentication":"a5f5db7075f12b145843dc83f680cec4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_088_014_002_o2.jpg","size":1484210,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2816,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04880214909511799981078894461461459286510944366455078125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["021914"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["021914"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["021914"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cf06c261c2f9df2fe45744669304e8bb.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460517,"FileSize":1484210,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2816\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2816,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:01:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025000000000000001387778780781445675529539585113525390625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:19:14","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:19:14","ShutterSpeedValue":5.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3361,"ExifImageLength":4296,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"This, you know encourages both teacher & scholars. and has an influence on the school which is not realized & appreciated by but few.\n\n  But, as I said before, I feel that I am not at home,- that I am not in that school.\n  The next day after I closed there, application was made to me to teach a school here, and in less than 2 hours I was on my way to W.

The return of Autumn, together with the sound of Mr. Goldsbury's bell, brings to mind past days, reminds me of the happy days when I attended school under your instruction, and raises within me a wish that I could again enjoy the same privileges.

The line may come when I shall not be so far behind some of those who have had greater privileges than I have, and a few of whom now try to look down on me from their elevated (real or fancied) stations with contempt. \"Never give up\", \"diligence and perseverance overcome all difficulties\", \"hope for the best.\" These have been my mottoes, therefore, these are my mottoes now and these shall be my mottoes hereafter.

Jan. 11, 1848.\nBrother Kendall,\nOften does my mind revert to the times we have passed in each other's company and wish I might again enjoy the same privilege again. Right well would I like this evening, to hold a tete a tete conversation with my old friend & brother Kendall. But, as that pleasure is forbidden me I will improve the only substitute for it, and I hope it will be as acceptable to you as it is agreeable to me. In the first place I will give you an inkling of my present situation. I am in my second school and have been here a little more than two weeks. Not exactly in the Mount Caeser School, but in the same district, and with some of the former pupils of Mt. C. Seminary.\nI have about 45 scholars, embracing, of course, a great variety of dispositions, habit, propensities, etc. We find, you know, some who have been indulged by mistaken parents in almost every childish whim, -- some, who have been debarred from even innocent amusement, --Some who have been taught that money is the root of all good and must procured at all events, -- Some in fact of every possible description (almost) and all our talent for government, all our knowledge of human nature must be exercised. And not only does the teacher have the numerous & conflicting dispositions of his pupils to encounter, but, what is often worse, those of nearly as many parents.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42796,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/42796","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c387fd077732cae56470e7d5e1b75505.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c387fd077732cae56470e7d5e1b75505.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c387fd077732cae56470e7d5e1b75505.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c387fd077732cae56470e7d5e1b75505.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:38:16+00:00","modified":"2020-04-28T03:34:10+00:00","filename":"c387fd077732cae56470e7d5e1b75505.jpg","authentication":"2f9b5032af64c6aae99c4ed538515d3d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_089_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1752035,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2852,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.056881298374109996729419691519069601781666278839111328125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022028"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022028"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022028"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c387fd077732cae56470e7d5e1b75505.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460517,"FileSize":1752035,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2852\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2852,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:02:17","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025000000000000001387778780781445675529539585113525390625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:20:28","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:20:28","ShutterSpeedValue":5.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3287,"ExifImageLength":4148,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Too often is it the case that, when the child takes a little offence he is encouraged by his parents. to disobey again and this is a fruitful source of more mischief.\n    I would not have you to infer that such is the case here more than in many other places, I was speaking of a too common evil.

That must depend in a measure upon our past lives. If the reflections of the past are pleasant, if we are rightly improving the present we are happy. But if on the contrary the past bring naught but thoughts of sadness, if the present is unimproved our share of happiness is small. It often witnesses the formation of bright hopes and fond anticipations of future happiness, which are as unlikely to be unrealized as those which we have already cherished and seen withering in decay. But the future is yet to come, and what does it contain? Who can tell? Who can pierce its dark vail and reveal its hidden mysteries? No mortal arm has strength sufficient fore such a task. No mortal eye can pierce the vail and see what lies beyond. Each day as it rolls onward realizes to us some dream of happiness or disappoints some long cherished hope.

I can respond yes to that, for I shall leave New England in six months from now Providence permitting. Ella visited with our church last summer and she seems to enjoy her religion very much. She has always said she should go to the south to teach and I think she will. I received an invitation to go to Indiana to teach, last fall.

This school being near her farm, and she had concluded it was impossible to procure a suitable Lady, in time. I do regret not knowing your wishes sooner; for I do believe Miss Weed would have suited admirably, - have been pleased and added to the happiness of my friend's family. I doubt whether she will like the present arrangement, for I know she had entered into it with much hesitation, but could not now withdraw, tho she might prefer having Nannie at home with Miss Weed.\n   Please give my love to your Sister, Mrs. Wright & family--I should be very much gratified to spend a few days with you all once more.

Since you left here my health has not been very good, You will remember that about the time school closed or a little before I took a bad cold which settled on my lungs. this I suppose caused me to have a spell of the Childs and fevers these kept me in bad health& for three or four weeks since that time my health has been improving and I can now say that I am be well. The Cholrea has not been very bad around here any how it has not got hold of me yet. While I was sick I received word from a Nighborhood in the upper & edge of Spenser Co that the people wanted me to teach a school I visited the people and they made up a very good school it is in a very good place for the business and I think I am likely to do well.

I showed him the letter of recommendation you you gave me  - put the best side out and yankee like told him I was ready to teach \"the young idea how to shoot\" into all the branches imaginable, Latin & Bookkeeping not excepted.  The next thing was to agree upon the terms. I told him I could not think of teaching short of five hundred pr. year - and I am now at work at that rate.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42832,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/42832","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/1cb85dc22abf0369806d91356715d2e0.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/1cb85dc22abf0369806d91356715d2e0.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/1cb85dc22abf0369806d91356715d2e0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1cb85dc22abf0369806d91356715d2e0.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:40:19+00:00","modified":"2020-04-29T19:37:12+00:00","filename":"1cb85dc22abf0369806d91356715d2e0.jpg","authentication":"58f6dce7b6369d99125c1bc57e9423cf","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_089_011_002_o2.jpg","size":1768019,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2879,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.056861918361570999713716645374006475321948528289794921875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022509"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022509"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022509"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1cb85dc22abf0369806d91356715d2e0.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460519,"FileSize":1768019,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2879\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2879,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:03:56","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025000000000000001387778780781445675529539585113525390625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:25:09","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:25:09","ShutterSpeedValue":5.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3361,"ExifImageLength":4202,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"After due consideration I concluded that \"it is not good for man to be alone\"(especially in Kentucky) and as the people here were not particular about having the school commence immediately on account of fixing the house etc. I went to Akron --bought to a 'focus' my former engagements and now have my wife with me.\n\n                            I intended to have returned in four weeks, but did not under five.

I should not write at this time except under the peculiar circumstances existing. Mrs. Hikes (Mr. Edward Hikes' mother) is dangerously ill  --her recovery is somewhat doubtful and my wife thinks I ought to inform you of the fact as your sister and Miss W. knowing it would be much pleasanter for them and at the same time more convenient for Mr. Hikes' family, would prefer coming some other time than the present.  You cannot think how disappointed we are. Ever since we came from Mt. Washington we have been looking forward to \"Christmas\" when we thought we should see you once more and have \"a heap\"of enjoyment. But we shall insist upon your coming at your vacation at any rate. We shall of course see you, if not the ladies, in a few days; for if you go to Louisville and do not stop to see me, I'll never call you a yankee again.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42836,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/42836","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/1b58960e5714722347b294f5beac85fb.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/1b58960e5714722347b294f5beac85fb.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/1b58960e5714722347b294f5beac85fb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1b58960e5714722347b294f5beac85fb.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:40:31+00:00","modified":"2020-04-29T20:10:50+00:00","filename":"1b58960e5714722347b294f5beac85fb.jpg","authentication":"95cf41853d05d03348c99697fdbb0359","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_089_012_002_o2.jpg","size":1493819,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2834,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04880613058365400325211425069937831722199916839599609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022536"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022536"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["022536"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1b58960e5714722347b294f5beac85fb.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460519,"FileSize":1493819,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2834\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2834,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:04:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025000000000000001387778780781445675529539585113525390625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:25:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:25:36","ShutterSpeedValue":5.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3334,"ExifImageLength":4235,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Since I saw you I hope prospered quite well---got off a Balloon-- Lecture etc. But more when I see you.\n\n   Did you get the box of apparatus safe and in season?

The winds from the lake are very keen- and the Slays has been perpetually going. the folks Seem to enjoy themselves very much in Slaying wraped up in their rugs, furrs Muffs etc. and their actions (for actions Speaks louder than words) Seem to Say that they enjoy themselves as well as those of a more temperate latitude.\n                       I am happy to Say that my Sundays are Spent in a very pleasant manner by attending the churches of divines that are interesting -- we have two ministers in the city (Presbyterian and Unitarian) which I attend alternately who are very interesting they have their Sermons arranged in such Systematic order that a person of ordinary intelect is almost compelled to apreciate the value and Superiority of their discourse- but I am Sorry to Say that thare are others who do not understand the first principles of preaching (if they do they don't practise them) and are inferior to the dry Sermons that we have in Mt.

I taught Latin part of a session last year, and French a short time, but in general I think there is much less interest taken in the languages in this country, than farther north. We have had a very mild Winter--so mild that flowers have been in blossom nearly the whole season. On the 26th there was something of a snowstorm--rare occurrence in this country, with very cold weather for the season.

I have so many other things to take up my time that I find very little leisure for studying them.

He taught school successfully last winter - practises surveying whenever he can get an opportunity = and would like well to be a civil Engineer.

James H. Hobbs to N.K.\nHuntsville Arkansas April 18, 1850\nMr. Kendall\nDear Sir:-\nPerhaps you have looked for a letter from me and wondered why I did not write, and have thought for a moment that I had forgotten my promise, or that that respect and love that I now have and ever have had since our first acquaintance, for you had waxed cold. The reason that I have not written, because I have forgotten you! Forget the many pleasant moments that we have spent together in the capacity of teacher and student and also socially? Forget the rambles we have taken near the pleasant village of Mt. Washington seeking some of those pure streams of water whose meandering course finds their way over those high rocks! All these things forgotten: No,Sir,ungrateful indeed would I be to let such moments of pleasure pass by unnoticed and unappreciated. Those b books which you taught me to peruse by being absent from me may be forgotten. Mythology, Aesops Fables and other parts of Latin may slip the memory but those lessons that I received at your room when the flickering taper supplied the great luminary of day I would be thrice happy could I call it the same way that I have in by gone days: Miss Kendall no less natural sounds her name and memory wanders back and tells me that I was a student also of hers, that lesson after lesson, and instruction after instruction I have heard fall from her lips. \nWhile these things are flickering across my mind the thought arises\"Where am I\". Am I in such a country as you are;where prosperity, happiness and pleasure may attend all, or am I in a country where these things are not known. Really I know not how to answer the question for I never have been at any place where the people enjoyed themselves better than here. I am n near the Red Man's home and now and then we can see the squaws carrying such packs as they do. The smoke of their wigwarms may be seen assending which seems to tell the doleful tale that the tribe will soon be extinct.\nIn my imagination I see you going up to the Academy and after you have got there I see you figuring around as though your whole soul was ingaged, imparting instruction and building a foundation for many pupils that may lead them to future happiness, prosperity and renown. God bless the Teacher, Though he's bothered, perplexed and harrassed by his bad pupils there is a pleasure arising from a consciousness of doing good. I have the honor to be the principal of the Huntsville School and think that I am getting along very well. I know not how much longer I will teach school as I expect to comment the practice of law before a great while.\nTell my brother and his family , howdy.

At the time the city of Orleans was beseiged by the duke of Bedford. Joan pretended to have received a divine communication to expel the invaders. She was introduced to Charles VII, she offered to raise the seige of Orleans and conduct the prince to Reims to be crowned, at the same time demanding for herself a consecrated sword that had for a long time hung in the Church of St. Catherine. Her request was granted and she at the head of her army entered triumphant the city of Orleans, and appeared in a splendid armour at the coronation of Charles which took place in the Cathedral of Reims. She then though her mission done and sought to retire to private life, but  but finally yielded to the public wish and and remained in public life.  She was finally taken by the English I think, and was condemned to death and actually was burned at the stake in the Market place of Rouen in the early part of the year 1431.

If this is done it is evident that those ministers who may be living at that time will have to attempt to sustain either the old or new translation and let them take either they choose and they should be prepared to sustain these positions for it is evident should it so happen that the bible is translated again that there will be greater division between the different religious seats than","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42877,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/42877","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/1cee38fc7a1e9c6ef85e2c9b7447eac8.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/1cee38fc7a1e9c6ef85e2c9b7447eac8.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/1cee38fc7a1e9c6ef85e2c9b7447eac8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1cee38fc7a1e9c6ef85e2c9b7447eac8.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:42:49+00:00","modified":"2020-04-30T19:28:49+00:00","filename":"1cee38fc7a1e9c6ef85e2c9b7447eac8.jpg","authentication":"a7318d997c0a71db2c90dcd628d83869","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_091_005_003_o2.jpg","size":1518223,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2822,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04981438827204200114895371598322526551783084869384765625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["023242"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["023242"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["023242"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1cee38fc7a1e9c6ef85e2c9b7447eac8.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460520,"FileSize":1518223,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2822\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2822,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:06:06","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025000000000000001387778780781445675529539585113525390625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:32:42","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:32:42","ShutterSpeedValue":5.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3347,"ExifImageLength":4269,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"has ever heretofore ?

But a sad requiem has sounded, as the March of Time has wafted two times and almost three years to my notice, and duty calls me to the alarm of a change of vocation. But, Miss K., I had rather be a student than anything Else. To be a student I would freely undergo the difficulty of pronunciation in French - Latin verbs and nouns, and almost anything in the shape of Study. My Schooldays have Ended with an unfinished Education--much regretted. There is a great deal of ignorance in this country, and So I cannot Enjoy myself here like I could at Marietta. I have done nothing yet in the way of Speaking, but Expect to soon. Miss Kendall, who were your French Scholars? How did they get along? I wish I could finish French for I liked the study. I wish you to tell me if the French Colloquy was spoken, and how it went off. How do you get along in Music? What Scholars played at the Examination? What kind of music and who else played at the Exercises. I'd almost  give a $1000 could I have been there Now, does the baby grow much? I would like to see it very much. How do the Weavers do, and what their progress in Study and Music? Give them my regards. You have lost a splendid scholar---Miss Pollock alias Mrs. Peters. Now I think, if the \"Reverend\" had finished his Latin any Greek he might have been ready to marry. But \"so goes the world\". But as this is a tender subject I'll \"drop\" it. We have a female school in Greencastle but I fear, -- a poor thing. They turn off graduates, but how far their graduation Extends, I am unable to say. But I guess, not far. I shall attend the College Exams next Wednesday.\n\n                                        Miss Kendall I should like to hear from my old school teacher; so if you will write me I will write more next time certain.

My health at the time of my writing last, was improving and I was quite Sanguine in regard to it; but latterly it has been quite poor. I engaged a school for the winter but have been obliged to abandon the idea of teaching at present. The doctors think my disease to be upon the liver, and I am now taking medicine for it.

If you have I can heartily say that I am pleased with the choice you have made. If I could only see you I would say much more than I can commit to paper. Why can you not when your school is finished come down and spend a few weeks with us? We should enjoy it So much. I have nothing to do, and we could use up the time with pleasure and profit. When tired with talking we could spend the time in reading for there is a large Library here, which was given to the town by Professor Wayland.

They will have studied the gospel of Matthew critically, and Seilen on the Principles of Interpretation an Porter's Principles of Textual Criticism, Also the Hebrew Grammar, and perhaps a dozen Chapters in the Hebrew bible. Probably Mr. Kendall will find it difficult to purchase a copy of Porter and Seilen. But I presume he can have one from Divinity Hall. In regard to the Hebrew, I suppose he may find it difficult to prepare himself. If he chooses, I will accept an equivalent for that in Greek, say in Xenophon's Memorabilia.

For a combination of all that is pure beautiful and lovely --for the very beau ideal of female loveliness, I think Agnes surpasses anything I have Ever met with in fiction. What a blessing it would be for us all if there were many such as Agnes to animate and Encourage with their warm and generous Sympathies. Yet where shall we find Such? Echo answers where?  My reading still continues to consist mainly of the works of the immortal poets. No inconsiderable part of my leisure time is now employed in attending some of Excellent courses of lectures that are being delivered.\n                                           I regret very much that I have not","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42942,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/42942","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/0408d9f5d0c72f4f26079da964c18401.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/0408d9f5d0c72f4f26079da964c18401.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/0408d9f5d0c72f4f26079da964c18401.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0408d9f5d0c72f4f26079da964c18401.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T14:46:10+00:00","modified":"2020-05-01T20:52:57+00:00","filename":"0408d9f5d0c72f4f26079da964c18401.jpg","authentication":"3c893464d66bc1bed38fcaf2e2cf7b4f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_092_011_004_o2.jpg","size":1476885,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2888,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047350627116035999553123048144698259420692920684814453125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["024735"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["024735"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["024735"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0408d9f5d0c72f4f26079da964c18401.jpg","FileDateTime":1509460523,"FileSize":1476885,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2888\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2888,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:08 15:08:50","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025000000000000001387778780781445675529539585113525390625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 02:47:35","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 02:47:35","ShutterSpeedValue":5.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":15,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3003,"ExifImageLength":3743,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":186,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/186","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"time to write more frequently to you as it always give me much pleasure.

When seated, here away from home and acquaintance, my thoughts often wander back to our school room, to the scenes which passed there, and the tears rush unbidden to my eyes, hen I think those scenes are forever past, that they can never be recalled. You may think it silly to give way to one's feelings in such a case, but if it is is must be so, for I can't help it. Often times have I thought at the close of school, that I never could enjoy myself so well another term but never have I left a school with such feelings as I did that last.

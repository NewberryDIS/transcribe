Levies of troops have been made from each count & there are ready at a moments notice to join the Main Army when required.   The volunteers who have come in from the United States are stationed on the circuity of the Rio Grande, to protect the frontier in that direction.  Thus no march of the Mexicans can now take place into Texas without meeting with ? opposition.   The Texan Navy has returned from Yucatan;  it is now refitting at New Orleans & in a few days will be in ready for Sea\n\n  Much has been said relative to some ? around the Steamers that are in preparation in England to assay aid, but there is reason to believe that they will not do wonders.

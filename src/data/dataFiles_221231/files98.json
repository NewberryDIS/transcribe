March 10, 1851\nDear brother Robert:\n\n   Rejoice with us, the \"dumpling day\" is coming. One short week after tomorrow and our charming cousin, who has already commenced to nibble at the enticing bait will be fairly caught in the trap. So sad day shall that be to our sweet cuz, I hope, for many a delicious morsel does that trap contain and may many a bright day of future bliss dawn on its inmates. Mary sends a note in this to her brother in regard to getting cake. If Henry says anything to you about it you will of course assist him to select it. Give your advice in favor of good sized loaves so that she may be sure to have enough. You know we don't want a very leetle piece we don't have some wedding cake every day. I hope you will come up for your share, but you know best how it will be about your business. I will not advise you to leave if it will be an injury to you, we will save some cake for you and tell you just how they act. I suppose they will do it up right as Sarah has been very faithful in giving Mary lessons in the part she must take, and his sisters, no doubt, are as good to him. If you come up that day mother says I can return with you, if not I will be down in a day or so after. Should you think I cannot be of much use to you just let me know, and I shall content myself to remain at home. Mary tells Henry if he does not feel able to get her any to speak to you to get some.

There has been an immense vegitation this season and on account of the quantity of rain, there is a great deal of decay, which renders it somewhat unhealthy.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":24656,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/24656","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/72321460887a907def96476b5b15e061.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/72321460887a907def96476b5b15e061.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/72321460887a907def96476b5b15e061.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/72321460887a907def96476b5b15e061.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-05T14:31:28+00:00","modified":"2020-03-25T00:17:10+00:00","filename":"72321460887a907def96476b5b15e061.jpg","authentication":"264b9fa55204adc42f020cd08be19b68","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_04_fl_157_005_05_o2.jpg","size":1159891,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2740,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.039196100297378001775516764837448135949671268463134765625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["022148"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["022148"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["022148"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["022148"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["022148"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["022148"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"72321460887a907def96476b5b15e061.jpg","FileDateTime":1507213753,"FileSize":1159891,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2740\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2740,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:08 14:03:35","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 02:21:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 02:21:48","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":64,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":98,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/98","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I am enjoying my school very much.

This makes my school smaller this term and gives me a little discipline to do, but it is nothing serious. It did not take long for my pupils to learn that I was master.

I should be obliged to go down alone in the stage if I went today and if I waited a few days Henry would take me with Elizabeth and John Henry. Now, as I thought that it would not be very pleasant to go to commencement unless you were able to accompany me I of course choose to go when I may have company. I cannot tell now just when I shall be with you it will be either the last of this week of the first of next. Do not expect me till I come and then you will be sure not to be disappointed. Mary came back from Boonville last evening, she had a very pleasant visit. Our S.S. class recited 324 verses Sunday last, Miss Tanner said 114 of them. Henry took charge of Mary's class. Mrs. Thomas is getting better, there is some hope now that she will recover. John Henry is doing very well up in Steuben he seems to like the country very much. Anna says I must be sure to tell you that your Horse-shoe Geranium is blossomed. The flower is quite pretty. We are going to wash today and I am in great haste so you must be satisfied with a short note. I expect to stay a day or two with you when I go down. We are beginning haying today.

I have not forgotten my promise to Nettie, she shall hear from my eye before long. Have you got your black caps made yet? Does Margaret laugh at them? Give me love to her and say I thank her for all her kindnesses to my sister. Love to Mr. Kellogg's family Susan in particular, Mrs. Earle, the Misses Royse, Shattuck, Bake Tompson, Eliza Kellogg and all other friends not forgetting Marie Scott. We are all pretty well. The children have gone to school. Father and mother went to Ninetysix yesterday afternoon and returned last evening. We have not heard from Elizabeth since I came home. They are beginning to wash and I must hasten. John's health is much the same as it has been. Sister Margaret's class beat us yesterday they said 79 verses and we only 71 we feel a little bad about it but never mind \"it is all in the family.\" I cannot say when Mary will write to you, I will just run and see. I guess you will see something from my pen before long to let you know that I am yet your sister. Is not Jane a dear good faithful sister? I wish I was half as good but Sarah. I love you yet and my thoughts often dwell with you in your own pretty little room.  can write no more at present, as I must go and wash. Almost too dear I think I am. How do your singing boy and rattle box get along. I suppose you have that fruit you so much wanted. How did it taste? Is your candy all gone? Give my respects to the Dr. Remember your next letter is to be written to Anna. With much love to you in which all join. from your sister Jane","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":24667,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/24667","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f988f7ac3e1d82973b8294ae4ac61096.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f988f7ac3e1d82973b8294ae4ac61096.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f988f7ac3e1d82973b8294ae4ac61096.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f988f7ac3e1d82973b8294ae4ac61096.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-05T14:32:05+00:00","modified":"2020-03-26T22:50:59+00:00","filename":"f988f7ac3e1d82973b8294ae4ac61096.jpg","authentication":"4289770825e0cad2412698d6073bd51f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_04_fl_158_003_01_o2.jpg","size":969742,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2241,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040067347579619001785022902595301275141537189483642578125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["022320+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["022320+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["022320+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f988f7ac3e1d82973b8294ae4ac61096.jpg","FileDateTime":1507213754,"FileSize":969742,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2241\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2241,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"8mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:05 11:46:41","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 02:23:20","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 02:23:20","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTime":0,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"SubSecTimeDigitized":0,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1438,"ExifImageLength":2310,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":98,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/98","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Galesburg, Dec. 22, 51\nDear Sarah:\nAnna has been appointed one of the Editresses of the Junior Paper.

It is, as you know, more than three months since my last letter was written, how long seems the time! Why did I thus treat my friends and self? for I am the sufferer. Alas! I am ashamed to own that I should thus yield to disappointment. A strange infatuation hung over me, I shrunk from the pen as men do from the leprosy, but I hope the spell is at length broken.\n    Thank you, my sister, for writing to me, and especially for making your letter short. I should like to have heard more particularly of \"the old house at home\" and the treasures clustered there, but \n\nannotation Jennie to Sarah  \/annotation\nin margin:\nRobert is very much in need of those vests which I took home to mend. He says if he does not have them soon he will be obliged to wear his best one every day, this would be quite too bad as he has so many at home quite good enough for that purpose. I have repented more than once that I ever took them up. I hope you will ask mother to send them soon. If there is no earlier opportunity perhaps they can be sent with Mary Thomas next Saturday. I hope they will not be forgotten as indeed this is the most important business of my letter. It is snowing a little just now. We have not had much sleighing as yet. Ask Sarah if she succeeds in cultivating her self-esteem as Mr. Fowler advised. I find it quite a task. Tell mother that I found three more of her plates down here. I will send them up at the first opportunity. I have not baked any thing yet but I will try to soon. We have no cooking stove up now. How is Mary's head now? Does she succeed in taking any treatment? I am glad to hear that you have a girl. I hope she will prove just the one mother wants. I am glad that you are again taking packs. I hope the next time I hear you will have tried the sitz-bath. Do Sissie and Eddie go to school every day. We have had some pretty hard weather for them to go through. Cousin Henry went to see Lizzie a short time since. She is doing very well.

I finished my composition that I commenced last week, subject Selfishness and Benevolence. I have enjoyed this day very much and had a grand walk this eve. Goodnight. Sun 6: I wonder how our Sarah has been this pleasant Sabbath day. We have been out to church thrice. This evening Mr. swift preached from the last clause of the twentieth verse of first chapter of Romans, \"So that they are without excuse.\" The object of his sermon was to show that the existence of Got is proved from our moral nature. As also it is proved by our physical and intellectual nature. So that were there no other evidence we should still be inexcusable if we did not believe in God. The afternoon discourse was preached by Rev. Mr. Boardman, Detroit, from Lev 18: \"Thou shalt not let any of they seed pass through the fire to Molek.\" This he said he thought meant \"save all the children.\" He spoke mostly of the efficacy of the Sabbath schools. Particularly the good they were accomplishing in the west. I thought from his discourse that he was an Agent of the A.S.S. This evening we had a very interesting monthly concert.

It was such a treat to receive one from my father. Dear father, I thank you very much for your sacrifice of those precious moments spent in writing that well commenced family letter. Oh! that the others had been so faithful, then indeed it would almost seem as though I had seen all our pleasant family circle at my own loved home. That \"ancient scrap\" as you call it has however furnished me with a very pleasant chat with my father and mother and a short one with Sarah my sister. The regulations of our school I have already learned to love, not not only as being necessary but as the best that could be formed for a school of this size and character. There have been instances of girls here becoming sick in consequence of receiving food from their friends or purchasing, and therefor they made a rule in relation to it, so it has been with the other requirments of this nature; they have formed them as the case required, for example, our dining hall has been rather noisy before sitting down to the table and after rising while we were going out, Miss Whitman requested the young ladies several times to be more quiet, but this had on effect; so a new regulation was added to the others, that we should not speak at all after entering the dining hall until we sit down nor at all after rising from table. I suppose I should say in connection with this that when we go to table we all stand back of our own chairs until the tardy bell strikes, which is a sign for us all to be in our places, and then Miss Whitman makes","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":24743,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/24743","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f7dcba5bb869174d4745682b877b068f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f7dcba5bb869174d4745682b877b068f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f7dcba5bb869174d4745682b877b068f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f7dcba5bb869174d4745682b877b068f.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-05T14:39:12+00:00","modified":"2020-01-16T22:16:22+00:00","filename":"f7dcba5bb869174d4745682b877b068f.jpg","authentication":"568fe64b219db37b75eb3c9e1da205cd","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_04_fl_156_001_02_o2.jpg","size":1437686,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2736,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048654632337015002452318412906606681644916534423828125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["010323"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["010323"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["010323"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["010323"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["010323"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["010323"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f7dcba5bb869174d4745682b877b068f.jpg","FileDateTime":1507214290,"FileSize":1437686,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2736\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2736,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:08 13:34:02","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 01:03:23","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 01:03:23","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":98,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/98","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"the first move, so you see we may not speak before the benediction is pronounced.

It was was a very interesting letter. there was quite a revival in that school.

I thank you many times for devoting that new years day to writing to me. It was so pleasant hear from father and mother the same time. I was very sorry to hear that Sarah was no better. I do hope that Dr. Fitch will be able to help her. How long since Dr. Gittean has ceased to attend her? Did he consider her case as hopeless or did he think all the time that he could help her? I wish I could pass this next vacation with her, but this may not be and I am content to do that which is for the best. I do not think I should be homesick at all if Sarah was only getting well. It often seems strange to me, how I could ever summon courage to come so far to school and leave her so sick at home. I would write to her to night but my time is so far spent that I fear I cannot. I shall surely write next tuesday evening, if God permits. Tell her to keep up courage as well as she can. I wish Mary could be at home with her, I fear she is very lonely. Tell Gwen that I am very thankful to her for coming to keep my sister company and I shall ever love her for it. I hope Sarah's head will soon be better. Does it affect her eyes any? When next you write please tell as particularly as you can about her.

I am a strange creature, I must confess, thus to let every little delay chase away my smiles, especially when I know how much you always have to occupy your time, but it is nothing more than you should expect to have one oddity among so many sons and daughters. I have not been very well for the two last weeks and perhaps I feel more childish than usual just now. I am getting better now and I hope to resume my duties again next monday. the Dr. says so if I gain as fast as I have. I have not been into school exercises since a week last friday. I was not much sick but did not feel able to study. I do not take any medicine now, the Dr. came to see me yesterday he said that I was 50 per cent better than when he saw me the last time (Thurs. eve). The Dr. has been to see me five times in all, shall not have to see him again unless I am worse. I suppose I shall need some more money to pay the expense of my illness.

I hope soon to be well, there was nothing particular the matter of me, I did not have any appetite and of course became quite weak, I am now able to eat quite heartily.\nThurs. morn. It is a bright lovely day and the young ladies have gone to visit Mt. Holyoke. In your last you advised me to accompany them, but I am not quite strong enough to ascent its lofty side. More than half the school went, some who live near or who have been here before and visited it did not go. They went in two companies, the first started at 6 the other at 8, they expect to return a little after noon. Five carriages went each time and they were all well filled. Harriet has gone and Mary Wright, a young lady from Northampton, very kindly keeps me company until she returns. I felt quite disappointed in not being able to go, but if I return next year I hope to go then. I have told you that we are not allowed to purchase any eatables or drinkable, those who go upon the Mt. have permission to buy what water they may want. It is sold at 3 cents a glass. I am better today and in very good spirits. Wish I could see sister Sarah and the rest of you. Seven weeks more and I hope to hear your voices. I guess you will laugh when you see your rosy chubby daughter, to think she has so lately written to you about being sick. I don't suppose Sarah would think of being ill if she felt as well as I.

I received a letter from Elizabeth a short time since and learned by that that Mary has commenced her school. Wish she and Sarah would \"league\" together and at least write me a few words in your next letter. Mary has been very faithful in writing, but I fear lest she neglect me now thinking she has not time. I have almost despaired ever receiving an answer to my letter to John. I wonder if he thinks I have forgotten that he owes me one, Lewis to is still my debtor, they will need to hasten if they settle their account before I go home. I think every member of our ancient league will admit that I have acted right in ceasing to write regularly to them. It seemed almost wrong to take the time, which might be devoted to faithful correspondents, in writing letters that I had little hopes of being answered. I received a letter from Mary Thomas the first of last term never answered it because I could not write more than one a week and every week was a letter due to the league, she wrote me again last week and I shall endeavor to answer that soon.\nThis is the only letter I have had since I have been sick, and I assure you it was very joyfully received. Do write soon, you can form no idea from my poor scribbling how precious are your letters. Hattie has returned from the Mt. she brought me several flowers and stones from its summit. They had a very pleasant time, but are much tired. The carriages could only to to the foot and they had to climb up as best they could. Where does Lewis live now? M.J. said that E. Williams had a shop in his former home. I am sorry to hear that Jane Abrams is not more happy in her married life, I always had a very exalted opinion of Mr. & Mrs. A's kindness for I remembered their good apples and those fat geese he used to bring us. Excuse the writing of this sheet, I hope my next will look better.\nI will write again soon, do not be anxious about my health. Wish you could write so that I could get it tuesday eve. How is Henry's health now? I hope he will not work too hard. I fear dear father cannot endure the labor of another paper he has already so much to do. I must close with love to all.

It is quite doubtful whether I shall be able to study much this week. I hope to make up my lost lesson in philosophy so as to finish that this year I do not think it best to attempt any more. Next week thursday, we expect to commence our reviews in preperation for examination, and if I can attend to all my reviews I hope I can finish here in an other year, if my health is good. Do not feel anxious about me as I am getting better, though my strength seems pretty long in returning.

Dr. Poor, who has been a missionary to Ceylon 30 years and expects soon to return, lectured in the sem. hall to the young ladies, I was very sorry not to be able to attend. They say he was very interesting. \"His text was, come thou with us, and we will do thee good.\" I have not heard a great deal about what he said, but one thing Hattie told me I thought I must relate to father. He said that there was only one class of females in Ceylon who ever learned to read, they were called the dancing girls and they read in order to learn the songs. They never married and were regarded as the wives of the gods. They frequently steal children and educate them for dancing girls. He mentioned, this as one instance, a young girl who had charge of a white babe carried it out one day and the babe went to sleep, she laid it down in the shade and steped the other side of the bushes to pick some berries, while she was gone the dancing girls found the child and stole it. Great search was made for the babe but without success. Five or six years afterwards a friend told the mother that her child was at such a No. in a certain street, she immediately ordered her carriage and went to find it.

Please write again soon, you hardly how how much good even a few lines do me, with much love from your daughter.\nDearest Mary: I was very very happy to hear from you, and the next night I received a letter from Robert and both together made me so joyful that I hardly knew what to do with myself. I wanted to answer you that very night, but Harriet laughed at me because I had sent one that morning. I was sorry that you all felt so bad about my being ill as I have not been very sick. I hardly knew as I ought to tell you any thing about it, but Anne Gates said if I did not, she would. I am glad that you are all so well, but I fear Sarah does not improve as fast as she ought, I wish she would take example of me and get well quick. A person when sick is almost sure to be down spirited now and then, and I know how to pity Sarah when she feels so, I would much rather have the head ache or even tooth ache.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":24756,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/24756","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ea61323b81457b75e202e26c2e2d4ad6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ea61323b81457b75e202e26c2e2d4ad6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ea61323b81457b75e202e26c2e2d4ad6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ea61323b81457b75e202e26c2e2d4ad6.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-05T14:39:48+00:00","modified":"2020-12-12T15:17:30+00:00","filename":"ea61323b81457b75e202e26c2e2d4ad6.jpg","authentication":"e242b87007663fe1a0dec56d11b7ade4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_04_fl_156_004_04_o2.jpg","size":1371937,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2773,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.045810026579048999939569597472655004821717739105224609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["010431+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["010431+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["010431+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ea61323b81457b75e202e26c2e2d4ad6.jpg","FileDateTime":1507214290,"FileSize":1371937,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2773\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2773,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:05 11:43:25","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 01:04:31","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 01:04:31","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTime":93,"SubSecTimeOriginal":93,"SubSecTimeDigitized":93,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2277,"ExifImageLength":2956,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":98,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/98","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"When I get down hearted I sieze my pen and begin a letter to some of you and am soon cured. I would have given any thing could I have recalled the first part of my last letter when I found the effect of my other on Sarah, I did not think I had put anything in that like sadness. Tell her not to cry over this, for if she does I shall fear to write any more. I fell a great deal better than I did this morning when I wrote father's part. Only 38 more d before I start for home, three cheers for that time, then Sarah if you cry-- I had almost a mind to say you should get no kiss. Straw- berries are beginning to get ripe, I wish I could go out and gathe some and send them to Sarah, I know they would do her good. I have thought of something that I shall make her when I go home for a change, I will give her all the time till I come, to guess what it is. There has been quite an excitement here the past week, I told you in my last that three young ladies had been sent home. This was but the beginning of the troubles four more have gone and it is feared that others must leave before order and quietness can be restored. The teachers all have a very hard time and some of them are almost sick. As Miss Whitman and Miss Hazen are both absent the trustees have examined the cases of the young ladies and they decide their fate. I cannot tell you what their offence is as it is a long story I will leave that till I come home. They seem to have no regard for the teachers, themselves or any one else. I have not heard so much about it as I should had I been well but I know enough to be astonished that girls could conduct so, had it happened in Amherst College there would no be so much wonder. -- This is a very pleasant day, not so warm as if has been, yesterday it rained quite hard all morning and cooled the air I think. Write soon and be sure to tell me if Sarah cries about this. How is Margaret? Where does Lewis think of going after he learns the daguerrian buisness? Is Mr. Roberts recovering his health?

Hadley, July 26, 1850.\nDear parents:\n\n  One week from this morn I hope to start for home. I think I shall need some more money though to carry me there. I fear you think me very extravagant, but indeed, I strive to be as frugal as possible. I have not become nearly so strong as I was before being sick, and I have been obliged to hire my washing all the time since I was first sick. This will cost about $2. We all, I think I told you, are required to work an hour every day and half an hour more wednesday. We must keep an account of how long we work, and if we do more than this they pay us for the plus time at the close of the year, if less we must pay the for what we are minus. It will be nine weeks, when the term closes, since I have worked any, and I shall therefore have to pay for 59 hours (as the half hour of wed's is called an hour) the price is 3 or 4 cents an hour I think 4 but am not quite certain. Some say the Dr. charges $1 a visit and he has been to see me 7 times in all. I have been to ride 5 times for which I must pay 50 cents. I do not know whether I must pay any thing for having my meals brought to my room so long, if I do I should not think it would be much. I have now on hand $18 which I fear will not be enough. I hope now that I shall be able to go to the church next thurs. and hear the address, if I do","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":24758,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/24758","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/23fa50815ec425efe18e16ad30779420.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/23fa50815ec425efe18e16ad30779420.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/23fa50815ec425efe18e16ad30779420.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/23fa50815ec425efe18e16ad30779420.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-05T14:39:54+00:00","modified":"2020-12-12T16:05:59+00:00","filename":"23fa50815ec425efe18e16ad30779420.jpg","authentication":"5d7d48a88f7af4130a699d50e8c4d314","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_04_fl_156_005_02_o2.jpg","size":1107595,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2648,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0387292645742420005294803786455304361879825592041015625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["010448"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["010448"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["010448"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["010448"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["010448"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["010448"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"23fa50815ec425efe18e16ad30779420.jpg","FileDateTime":1507214290,"FileSize":1107595,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2648\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2648,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:08 13:34:02","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 01:04:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 01:04:48","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":98,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/98","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I shall need a sunshade and one or two other things (the young ladies do not wear their bonnets to church) which will cost another $2.

I am sorry I said any thing about it as I do not think that was what ailed me. I guess it was nothing but ague in my head. I thought because the rest or some of them had it, I did.

She has been very anxious to take music lessons and this morning she began to do so. I hope it will not be too much for her.

May 3, 1858\nDear Mother:\n\n  We received your kind letter this morning, could you have seen us read it, you would not have thought it was \"not worth receiving.\" Your letters are always welcome, dear mothr, and this doubly so, being such good news. Why Anna found her cup of joy so full that it ran over in pearly tears. You say that it seems a long time since you have heard from us, forgive us if we ever cause you anxiety by our neglect, we try to write every week but sometimes one leaves it for the other till perhaps the week is gone. We shall try not to have it so again the next seven weeks. It seems too good to be true, to think of Father coming to Chicago. Oh, how I wish he could come here and see how and what his daughters are doing. It would only take seven and a half hours to come from C. here and then it would always seem so much pleasanter, if we should remain, to think that father had seen our place of labor. Besides, it seems that a little of pa's advice would do me so much good. You know a little of the troubles here. Last Friday the trustees met and elected Mr. Curtiss, president, 11 voting for and 10 against him. I know but little about him but I have heard nothing favorable. I do not know what is my duty, sometimes I almost think I ought to resign. I wish I could see for a little time that we might talk over matters.

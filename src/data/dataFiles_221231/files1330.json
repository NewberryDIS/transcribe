WHITELEY'S INSURANCE AGENCY.\nPOST OFFICE BUILDING TELEPHONE 168.\nRacine, Wis., Dec 6 1888\nDictated   Copy\nHon. Henry C. Payne,\nMilwaukee, Wis\nDear Sir: Mr. Simeon Whiteley of this city is about to make application for a consular appointment, and I submit to you some of the reasons why I must urge you to give him your most cordial assistance. Some of the facts are indeed new to me, although I have known Mr. Whiteley ever since I came to Racine.\nMr. Whiteley was one of the foremost in organising the Republican party in Illinois. He was one of the 17 Republican editors who met at Decatur Feby 22.1856, [see Nicolays Life of Lincoln] which provided for the meeting of the first Republican State Convention in Illinois. I have seen letters from Joseph Medill of the Chicago Tribune- Ex Lt. Governor Bross Ex Lt. Governor Beveridge- ex Lt Governor Shuman, editor of the Chicago Evening Journal- and Paul Selby editor of the Springfield (ILL) State Journal confirming the fact, and extolling Whiteley's abilities and character.\nI believe it to be demonstrable- that the election of Lyman Trumbull to the US. Senate( and that was a turning point in the political history of this country) might not have been accomplished but for the faithfulness and almost heroic self sacrifice of Mr. Whiteley.\nMr. Whiteley has shown me a letter signed by E B Washburne.

Owen Lovejoy, and W Pitt Kellogg. commending","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":111138,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/111138","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d0331153398e66f2fc1caf09227fa172.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d0331153398e66f2fc1caf09227fa172.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d0331153398e66f2fc1caf09227fa172.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d0331153398e66f2fc1caf09227fa172.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-13T21:51:27+00:00","modified":"2021-01-18T18:26:59+00:00","filename":"d0331153398e66f2fc1caf09227fa172.jpg","authentication":"ced99376c1c32020c6b16307f6f8a5c3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3024_BX01_FL003_00003_o2.jpg","size":1239588,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2762,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041555636012551001867709743464729399420320987701416015625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120607"],"TimeCreated":["103342+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120607"],"TimeCreated":["103342+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20120607"],"TimeCreated":["103342+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d0331153398e66f2fc1caf09227fa172.jpg","FileDateTime":1605304248,"FileSize":1239588,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2762\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2762,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:06:27 10:27:51","Exif_IFD_Pointer":154},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:07 10:33:42","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:07 10:33:42","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":70,"SubSecTimeOriginal":70,"SubSecTimeDigitized":70,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2278,"ExifImageLength":2969,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1330,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1330","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"2\nS.

Mr. Baker refused to accept until he had asked the advice of Mr. Whiteley and secured the promise of his assistance at Milwaukee headquarters.\nIn 1880 Mr. Baker insisted that Whiteley should take charge of the campaign in this County- A member of the County Committee resigned that Whiteley could be made chairman. And he won the regard of every Republican by his generalship.

He\nhadn't seen them for three years, and\na year since hardly dared to hope\nhe should for three more; but his\nemployer dispensed with his services,\nhe went to work on his own claim,\nand had been taking out $1000 per\nweek clear of all expense for the\nlast four months. In four or\nfive more years he would have\nall the money he would ever\nwant and they would have\nall the money they would all\nneed, and then they could go\nback East if they wanted.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":111205,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/111205","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/46bdd84c5321ad00d972da24c20c16b8.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/46bdd84c5321ad00d972da24c20c16b8.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/46bdd84c5321ad00d972da24c20c16b8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/46bdd84c5321ad00d972da24c20c16b8.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-13T21:52:45+00:00","modified":"2022-02-14T21:47:05+00:00","filename":"46bdd84c5321ad00d972da24c20c16b8.jpg","authentication":"e54750b4d237cec190c4234b9f5c5902","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3024_BX01_FL017_00013r_o2.jpg","size":1213939,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1789,"resolution_y":2884,"compression_ratio":0.07842779641446799565596137426837231032550334930419921875}},"item":{"id":1330,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1330","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"such a fool as to come out into this\ncountry and because I made a thousand\ndollars in a day, should begin to delve\nin that spot for more, and continue\nday and night, all day until the stars\ncame, all night until they faded away,\n-month in and month out- blasting\nthe rock which gave way sometimes\neight inches in twenty- four hours,\nuntil I was so poor that I couldnt\nget trusted for a place to lean against,\nuntil my partners and men all left me- and every\nbody laughed at me as I went by\nand said \"There goes that poor fool Flack.\"\nand I knew I was a fool as well as they\ndid, until one day I got through the\nCap. 173 feet of \"cap\"- and there lay the\nprecious \"iron.\" And then Presto!

John Lee came\nvery near- shooting him, but the pistol snaped,\nBenge told me that he did not want to\nsign the rolls, but he was compelled to\nsign them through fear, but he signed\nthem because he was afraid of those men.\nThe next day when they met at the  Court\nhouse in Sequoyah District, Columbus Benge\ntook his name of the Rolls or returns of\nLees Creek precinct. When Columbus Benge\ntook his name off the returns, he told them\nwhen he signed the roll he was afraid\nbut now he was not afraid.\n\n Question By Seales?\n     Was you one of the Superintendants\n\nof election in Sequoyah District?\n\n   Ans.

( but the suit\nfor pasturage, on part of the Indians\nbeing troublesome, on account of\nthe number interested, and the place\nof seizing being of doubtful legality","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":111425,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/111425","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7574492294e7497de8230e64722f6982.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7574492294e7497de8230e64722f6982.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7574492294e7497de8230e64722f6982.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7574492294e7497de8230e64722f6982.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-13T21:57:05+00:00","modified":"2021-01-24T20:29:57+00:00","filename":"7574492294e7497de8230e64722f6982.jpg","authentication":"66cf7c59a31e74388d1df690c05bff95","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3024_BX02_FL104_00005_o2.jpg","size":684360,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2301,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0275387512675650016069628378545530722476541996002197265625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120608"],"TimeCreated":["114236+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120608"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120608"],"TimeCreated":["114236+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120608"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120608"],"TimeCreated":["114236+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120608"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7574492294e7497de8230e64722f6982.jpg","FileDateTime":1605304262,"FileSize":684360,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2301\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2301,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:07:03 11:25:33","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":180},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:08 11:42:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:08 11:42:36","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":81,"SubSecTimeDigitized":81,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2435,"ExifImageLength":3808,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.71670190270015154965221881866455078125,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.90476190480012519401498138904571533203125,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1330,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1330","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"5.\n\nStill I think, if vigorously invoked\nit will effect all that is required\nand, enable the Indian Agent to\navoid all complications- growing\nout of the matter.\n\n                Very respectfully\n                 J.

Marcy of the Inspector Genls Office,\n\nupon Indian Affairs - As published in the N.Y. Tribune of yesterday - I notice\nsome statements of such an erroneous character, that I feel impelled to call attention\nto them.\n\nIn speaking of the present \"dual management\" of the Indians - as he terms it, the Genl says,\n\nsmall newspaper article attached:\n...military post may be established in the vicinity of an Indian agency for the protection of Indian officials and soon after the buildings\nare completed the agent may think proper to change the location of the agency to some smudged there? making  necessary new buildings, smudged for the smudged but for the troops. A case was reported one of the smudged of my Department where smudged of the Apache in Arizona, for reasons ? known only to himself removed his agency as far ? a con?? military post as he deemed it consistent with smudged per own salary, and ordered all the buildings, valued at $20,000, to be burned to the ground as soon as the Indians left. At the same time he knew that the lumber was greatly needed for repairing the quarters at the adjacent p?t.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":111620,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/111620","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e7e6bcae9692ac174faaa5a42dc44ad2.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e7e6bcae9692ac174faaa5a42dc44ad2.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e7e6bcae9692ac174faaa5a42dc44ad2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e7e6bcae9692ac174faaa5a42dc44ad2.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-13T22:01:20+00:00","modified":"2021-01-29T17:35:51+00:00","filename":"e7e6bcae9692ac174faaa5a42dc44ad2.jpg","authentication":"e81a330f6184f8322b65c238f0662247","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3024_BX02_FL129_00003_o2.jpg","size":1359106,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2878,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0437259027616919981884535673088976182043552398681640625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120611"],"TimeCreated":["081223+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120611"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120611"],"TimeCreated":["081223+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120611"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120611"],"TimeCreated":["081223+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120611"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e7e6bcae9692ac174faaa5a42dc44ad2.jpg","FileDateTime":1605304272,"FileSize":1359106,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2878\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2878,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:07:05 09:34:59","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":180},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:11 08:12:23","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:11 08:12:23","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":7,"SubSecTimeDigitized":7,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2425,"ExifImageLength":3033,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.71670190270015154965221881866455078125,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.90476190480012519401498138904571533203125,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1330,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1330","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"2\nIn this statement he first assumed that an Indian Agent may change the location of Agency at will.

Putnam\nMinister\nLudington, Mich., March 4, 1913.\nMy dear Aunt Mary:\nIt seems to me that I ought to write three or four letters to you one, for I feel that it is such an effort for you to write, and you have so many to remember.\n\n  I am wondering how you are standing the winter, and if you succeed in keeping that dreadful Grippe at bay. We have all had colds, and Holden's was quite of the nature of Grippe, so he was only able to preach once a week ago Sunday, but his grit was equal to the Grippe so he did occupy the pulpit in the morning. He has a funeral at the church this afternoon, and had to drive five miles to the home this morning. Elisabeth sings in the Quartette, but I have not been very well for a few days so did not go over. Didn't I have that bronchial trouble when I was in Remsen? It has never left me, and tho' I do not think my lungs are at all affected, I think it takes my strength. The Dr. is giving me an extract of Cod Liver Oil now which he thinks will help me.\n  We have not had a very hard winter, not below zero at all, and not much snow, tho' we have the most now that we have had at all. They have had a good deal harder winter at Charlevoix, so we are glad to be here. I think I have written you of Miss Clarke, who spent three winters with us at Charlevoix. She has been sadly bereaved this winter in losing her only sister and about the only near relative that she had. I feel so sorry for her. She visited us in the fall and writes me that she would like to come again after a little. I shall be glad to have her, for we may be some comfort to her. She wrote that we seemed the nearest to her of anyone now. She had two nieces but they are so much of society women that I fear they are not much company for her. \n  It is such a pleasure to me to be able to think just how you are situated in your pleasant comfortable home, with Good Mrs. Williams to care for her, and cousin Fannie coming down to see you once in a while. I hope Cousin Mary is getting stronger all the time. They are all \"pure gold\" aren't they?\n  Thank you for sending me the Advance containing the review of Cousin Eddie's book. Didn't they mistake the meaning of \"Quillings\"? We enjoy the poems so much, and are so proud of our cousin. I enclose a bulletin with a verse on it which Elisabeth wrote.\n  We had a great treat a couple of weeks ago in having Prof. Wm .Pickens of Talladega, Ala. give us three lectures. Holden made arrangements with him to make us two weeks tour of some of the churches in Michigan, and he was here first and lectured on Abraham Lincoln, then come back later and spent Sunday and spoke in the morning on the \"Progress of the American Negro\" and in the evening on \"Fifty Years of Emancipation\".

Putnam Minister\nLudington, Mich., May 28, 1913 \nMy dear Aunt Mary: \n\n   Your letter was a great pleasure, and I have been meaning to write again before this. Our spring is late as usual in coming and it has kept cold and raw.Today however is quite warm, and we are hoping for settled weather before long. Then I shall hope to get rid of this pleurisy, which has hung on altogether too long. I was not able to go to the state meeting with Holden as I had hoped. It was last week at Cadillac, and I was on the program to lead the devotionals at the woman's hour, so I was especially sorry to fail. Holden enjoyed the meeting very much, tho' it was a busy time for him as it always is. The Superintendent of schools in Cadillac used to be in Hudson when we lived there, Mr. McGee, and they invited Holden over to tea one night. When he came away Mrs. McGee gave him a box of nice cookies to bring home to me. Wasn't that fine in her? Please excuse\n\nthe looks of this writing. I did not like to waste so much paper on a wide margin. I think that women are naturally more frugal than men, don't you? Perhaps because the women do not have so much money to handle. How lovely it is that Roberts could go abroad. He is certainly a fortunate boy and no doubt ready to make the most of his opportunities. I think travelling is very broadening to anyone, whether in our own country or abroad. I wonder if Roberts will go to Wales and see, some of our cousins. I should care more for that than anything else, I believe. I suppose you will hear more often from Roberts. Please tell me about his travels when you write. Has John written you what Clarence is expecting to do? You know he will graduate from Oberlin in June, and he has accepted a position to teach the Protestant College at Beirut, Syria. He goes on a three years contract, so he will not come back during that time. He will teach commercial branches. It seems like a great opportunity for him, and we try to rejoice over that, but it surely will be hard for his father and mother to see him go as far and for so long a time. Still it is not for so long a time as the missionaries go. But Clarence has been away from home so little I know the separation will be hard. It will be a good thing for him tho' no doubt. Azia has not been at all well this spring, having a good deal of trouble with rhumatism. Did Lizzie write you about Claire's little boy? He came just the day before my birthday - May first - and is a nice healthy baby. They call him Lee Nathaniel Newcomer. Claire was getting along nicely the last I heard. Little Elizabeth is not very strong, but is a very sweet child. She will not be two for almost a month yet. \n\n  Anna made us a flying visit when she went home for spring vacation just coming and staying over night. She will soon be going home for the summer now. I expect one of the Charlevoix teachers here for a little visit about the middle of June. Then after she goes Miss Clarke is coming for another visit. She feels so lonely since her sister died, and feels very much at home with us, as she spent so much time with us in Charlevoix. Elisabeth and I are neither of us very strong yet, but are sure the warm weather will help us out when it comes. The springs are so late here.

But really I enjoyed every minute of it about as much as I ever expected to enjoy anything in this world. I started from home just a week after Lizzie and the rest left here. We had an excellent housekeeper to take charge of things and father was well, and busy with his classes, so I had no anxiety in leaving, and started off with good courage. At Toledo I had to change cars, buy a new ticket, and get my trunk rechecked, but had plenty of time, and no trouble. I reached Cincinnati at half past seven in the evening. Had a lach take me right to the Cranford House, when when I obtained a room, and had a good nights sleep. The next morning, after breakfast, I started out to find the Oculist's office, which I did with only making one inquiry. He had so many patients that morning, that waiting my turn, I didn't get an interview until half past twelve. I felt tired and discouraged, by that time, but was fully repaid for everything at last. He made a thorough examination of my eyes, throwing a strong reflected light into them, and decided that there was no disease of the eye, whatever, but only a loss of muscular balance To use his own words, he said that \"The internal or converging muscles were too weak for their antagonists, and the eyes inclined to diverge in consequence\". To overcome this he gave me a prism, by the use of which to exercise the weak muscles.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":34828,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/34828","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/401905caf8f84bcd39dda1b131f9f1d7.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/401905caf8f84bcd39dda1b131f9f1d7.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/401905caf8f84bcd39dda1b131f9f1d7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/401905caf8f84bcd39dda1b131f9f1d7.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T16:44:35+00:00","modified":"2020-12-05T22:56:31+00:00","filename":"401905caf8f84bcd39dda1b131f9f1d7.jpg","authentication":"cf233b72140a16083b6e5808fb2bcbe4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_03_fl_146_008_03_o2.jpg","size":944477,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2307,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.03790705421503000327465571217544493265450000762939453125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160307"],"TimeCreated":["000109"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160307"],"TimeCreated":["000109"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160307"],"TimeCreated":["000109"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"401905caf8f84bcd39dda1b131f9f1d7.jpg","FileDateTime":1507739823,"FileSize":944477,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2307\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2307,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"9mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:03:08 11:01:13","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:07 00:01:09","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:07 00:01:09","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1558,"ExifImageLength":2431,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":148,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/148","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I told him that I was going up the river to visit friends, and he said that I better come and see him again, on my way back.

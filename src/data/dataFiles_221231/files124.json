I shall be ready to go Friday afternoon or Saturday. If you cannot come for me I can go in the accommodation. I can have a vacation of one week in the haying time if they wish it and thus lose three days at the commencement of next term. Hope that will give satisfaction. John, I am really homesick; do you know what that means? Only think, it is more than six months since I have seen Sarah or Anna or Cynthia! But, one week more, and I shall see them all and Cousin Elizabeth too. I promise myself very much pleasure this summer. I have a great many questions to ask.

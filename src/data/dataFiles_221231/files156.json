He tells her there is no disease of the eyes - but one set of muscles is weaker than the others & she must use lenses to correct it.  She feels much encouraged, & is now visiting in S.E. Ohio.

It is thus very pleasant for me to have two sons in the ministry.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":36178,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/36178","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/858ca4b80c757bf68ac443f2c8324663.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/858ca4b80c757bf68ac443f2c8324663.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/858ca4b80c757bf68ac443f2c8324663.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/858ca4b80c757bf68ac443f2c8324663.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-12T13:36:27+00:00","modified":"2020-12-04T19:43:24+00:00","filename":"858ca4b80c757bf68ac443f2c8324663.jpg","authentication":"491535dafa323260fdf599ef454d5127","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_03_fl_136_001_03_o2.jpg","size":961194,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2270,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.039206803720020000358914558091782964766025543212890625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160304"],"TimeCreated":["061940"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160304"],"DigitalCreationTime":["061940"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160304"],"TimeCreated":["061940"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160304"],"DigitalCreationTime":["061940"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160304"],"TimeCreated":["061940"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160304"],"DigitalCreationTime":["061940"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"858ca4b80c757bf68ac443f2c8324663.jpg","FileDateTime":1507815166,"FileSize":961194,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2270\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2270,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:06:17 10:04:47","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:04 06:19:40","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:04 06:19:40","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":32,"SubSecTimeOriginal":51,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":156,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/156","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Frank Sands writes from Lewiston Maine, that he is well.

We were not prepared for this so sudden announcement. We feared several weeks ago, that his care would terminate as Br. Henry's did; but lately we were hoping that we should soon hear of his improvement. But it is ordered otherwise, and this early he is removed from present and prospective usefulness to a higher sphere. He was a brother who we very highly prized.

We are now visiting the lakes of Northern Italy, lying partly in Italy and partly in Switzerland.  We came to Lake Como a week today, where we remained till Friday, then came to Lake Lugano, & Saturday afternoon here.  In a day or two we expect to start on our journey across the Limflors?, on the way to Geneva.  My health continues to improve, and is now quite good.  I am sorry to say that Mr. Thompson, though better than when he left home, is not yet well.  By advice of his physician he left us a week ago, & went to the sulphur baths at Aix in Savoy, where he will remain some weeks.  The rest of our party are well.  We have a courier?, a native of Rome, who speaks  several languages, and is a very pleasant and capable man, so we get along quite well.  We have had but one letter from Mr. T. written soon after he reached Aix.  Since I wrote you before we spent another week in Rome, and visited Naples, Pompeii, Mt. Vesuvius, Florence, Venice, Milan, and other places of less note.  Easter Sunday was a great time with the Catholics at Rome.\nin margins:  I forgot that I have none of those envelopes, but I send you an old one that you can copy.\n\nI enclose an envelope such as Elizabeth uss in writing to me.  Put your letter in a sealed envelope directed to me & send a copy of this inside the one I send you.  Then it will reach me wherever I may be.  Hope you will write soon.  I remember love? to Lewis & family, & all my friends.

I find an English or Scotch church frequently both, in nearly all places where we stop, and often hear excellent evangelical discourses.  It is also encouraging to learn, that a strong evangelical movement is going on among the Catholics. Missionaries are coming forward to teach a pure Gospel, & expose the corruptions of papacy.  In Naples, Florence, Venice, Milan & other places a good work is going on.  Many are becoming tired & disgusted with popery, and it is to be hoped, the true faith will soon take its place.

Scarcely more than we should notice in travelling through New York or New England.  In the cities generally the streets are narrower; in some, especially Naples the goods are exposed more in the streets; indeed the people every where live more in the open air; fewer houses & more donkeys.  Scarcely any sidewalks, and the people walk in the middle of the streets.  Pictures of the Madonna, crosses & statues at almost every corner; also shrines & chapels to Mary in the Catholic churches much ceremony & mummery; no sermons, and I fear but little true worship.  All over the country things seem backward, behind the age.  Few manufactories, very little machinery, everything done by hand.  All sewing, spinning, measuring? by hand.  Plows & schythes very clumsy.  No reaping or mowing machines.  Women work in the fields with the men, cutting up the ground with large hoes in many places, instead of plowing, working in the hot sun bareheaded.  Most of the lower classes go bareheaded everywhere.  In Paris the women on the streets wear nice white caps.  I am not much disappointed in the appearance of things.  A great improvement is manifestly going on.  The English language is spoken more than I supposed.  I find very little trouble on that score.  Sometimes in the hotels funny mistakes are made.  One day I got out my razor & I called for hot water, & the waiter sent me up a barber with a whole box of shaving implements. another time Henry called for  tea plate & they brought a pot of teas, another of hot water, milk & sugar.

The meeting passed a note of kind regards to Dr. Everett, their former pastor, and requested me to communicate it to him.  Several of them gathered around me.  An old lady Mrs. Smith told me that when father Everett left Denbigh to go to America he took his last meal in her house.

I feel as though it would be pleasant for me to continue in this work a while longer, as my health is now pretty good.  Hope you are all well.  Mrs. B. and the children are very busy, so you will excuse them from writing now.  With much love to all.  Yours Truly,\nJ.J.

May he who has sustained you in the first still be with you, as he will. We all valued her and loved her much, her sweet, gentle spirit, so earnest, conscientious, and helpful. Her life, though brief, and troubled, was very useful. She has done what she could, and has gone to join the loved ones on the farther shore. We cannot wish to detain her here; to depart and be with Christ is better for her.

It is so little we can do for them, and nothing to detain them with us. We often think and speak of you.

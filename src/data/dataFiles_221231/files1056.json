It is obvious that such a people could not prove otherwise than extremely sensitive upon the least attempt to dispossess them of any part of the native land which they prized so dearly. No land in the world could equal it in attractiveness to them. With evidence of this their history overflows. I will give an instance from among the anecdotes of the elder Ridge in the large work entitled \"The Indian Tribes of North America.\" The story exhibits a remarkable contrast with that later course which led to his destruction.

The affair is interesting. I will give some of the leading particulars of it.\nBefore this event took place, the policy of removing all Indians from within the United States to an ample district west of the Mississippi and without the limits of any state or territory, had been so determined on the part of our government, that there was no longer any delicacy whatever in relation to the means by which it was to be attempted. The Cherokees and their neighbors the Creeks watched all movements on this subject with extreme jealousy. In 1822, congress had, at the instance of Georgia, made certain appropriations and had appointed commissioners, for the purchases of the Cherokee territory. At the following autumnal council of the Cherokees, a resolution was passed \"to hold no treaties with any commissioners of the United States for any cession of lands, the Cherokees being resolved not to dispose of even one foot of ground,\" \"having","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71045,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71045","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e9ec22a79d749d8cd37f336f57a9764c.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e9ec22a79d749d8cd37f336f57a9764c.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e9ec22a79d749d8cd37f336f57a9764c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e9ec22a79d749d8cd37f336f57a9764c.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:57:25+00:00","modified":"2020-03-27T20:37:42+00:00","filename":"e9ec22a79d749d8cd37f336f57a9764c.jpg","authentication":"8e7b8ae59cdad4324fc83522df8c10b6","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL06_00108_o2.jpg","size":458237,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2379,"compression_ratio":0.035669904877555003164246727465069852769374847412109375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["034910+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["034910+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["034910+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e9ec22a79d749d8cd37f336f57a9764c.jpg","FileDateTime":1522425414,"FileSize":458237,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2379\"","Height":2379,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2379,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:14:11","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3653},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 03:49:10","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 03:49:10","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":14,"SubSecTimeOriginal":14,"SubSecTimeDigitized":14,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2379,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1056,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1056","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"\"having not more than sufficient for themselves and their posterity.\" Notices of the resolution were sent to the commissioners, assuring them of a cordial reception on any other subject, but of the entire uselessness of putting their government to further expence on this.

About six months after, another attempt of the United States' agents was made to get up a Treaty, but it was equally unsuccessful. Notwithstanding these defeats, at the autumnal council of 1823, it was understood that the very commissioners who had been repelled before, were to attend at the Council Ground for the purpose of pressing for at Treaty. The council, of course, excited unusual interest. It was understood that the Creek Chief Macintosh, with some attendant chiefs of the same nation, would be present.

Your chief, William Macintosh, arrived here soon after the commencement of the present Council, accompanied by seven others of his countrymen, including his son and an interpreter. They were received by the General Council as friends and brothers, and an appropriation of money was made to procure forage for their horses.

There occurs in his early history a second instance of the acts of his more Roman days. It is described with strong panegyric in the account supplied by his son for the work already quoted, on \"The Indian Tribes of North America.\" The anecdote I mean is of the death of Doublehead, a great Cherokee orator, who, in 1806, when attended by a regular delegation, made a Treaty which the bulk of the Cherokees considered as contravening their instructions. In this Treaty Doublehead had secured a reservation for himself & a few friends of about ten miles square, in the region now including the Alabama town of Florence. He had proceeded, with the rest, to parcel out the reservation & sell it to the whites. This aggravated the public exasperation. His offence was not punished, but it was not forgotten. When a new encroachment was sought soon afterwards, the people believed that Doublehead meant to favor it. He had gone to the neighborhood of the site where Calhoun now stands, to meet the United States Commissioners on the subject.

In the midst of the tumult of half drunken? voices, some one caught up the candle from a table and held it near the face of Doublehead. Major Ridge darted silently behind the candle, blew it out and at the same moment shot Doublehead through the cheek, near the lower part of the ear. He fell. There was suddenly great confusion, rendered greater by the darkness. All ran out, exclaiming \"Who did it? Who did it?\" But none could learn at the moment who did it. The Cherokee log tavern-keeper closed and barred the door. It was found that Doublehead had only been wounded; though it was a severe wound.

When the chief of a town or clan, or other individuals, wish to play against another town or towns, a council is convened & decides on the subject. If a ball play is decided on, some person is appointed to bear a challenge to the party against whom they wish to play: this person is instructed in the terms to be proposed.

still however, the Cherokee Nation was not in state of peace with the Northern Indians, though their incursions\/incursing were but at intervals\/entervails, and four or five years after the peace with the British, Occunnostotoe & some of his warriors went on as ambassadors of peace to the State of New York, to the Superintendant under the British Government to the Northern\nNo.1","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71127,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71127","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5298ed5af4642a19e69313b8f69151f9.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5298ed5af4642a19e69313b8f69151f9.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5298ed5af4642a19e69313b8f69151f9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5298ed5af4642a19e69313b8f69151f9.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:58:32+00:00","modified":"2020-05-19T03:21:29+00:00","filename":"5298ed5af4642a19e69313b8f69151f9.jpg","authentication":"8815b233ffa18fac155dde1818a3ed9f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL07_FL001_00014_o2.jpg","size":832822,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2326,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0331526862201839966903804679532186128199100494384765625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["121531+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["121531+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["121531+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5298ed5af4642a19e69313b8f69151f9.jpg","FileDateTime":1522425417,"FileSize":832822,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2326\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2326,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:09:28 20:47:50","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 12:15:31","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 12:15:31","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":72,"SubSecTimeDigitized":72,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2415,"ExifImageLength":3737,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.21178889649991106125526130199432373046875,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.14196242170010009431280195713043212890625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1056,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1056","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"20\nNorthern Indians, and through his influence & mediation, a firm peace and friendship was established with the Northern Nation of Indians, which has continued ever since, and the nation had enjoyed peace with all nations from that time to the Revolutionary War, 1776, but the manners, customs & government of this nation will be necessary to be noticed, down to this last period.\nChs R.

They were received by the General Council as friends & brothers; and an appropriation of money was made to procure storage for their horses. After having showed them every friendship, we did not expect that William McIntosh had any ungenerous disposition towards the interest of this nation; but we were mistaken. We find that his visit here must have been entirely through speculative designs. He has used intriguing language with some of our Chiefs, to yield land to the United States\u2019 commissioners, who are now here for that object; and made promises of procuring a large sum of money from the United States\u2019 for them, in which he proposed to participate himself, for his trouble. His verbal suggestion, at first, was not taken notice of; but he still continued in the same course, and made a written communication to Mr. John Ross, the President of the National Committee, on the subject, promising the sum of nineteen thousand dollars paid over to such individuals as he may think proper, in case of a cession.

Your petitioners have, from time to time, made them known to your honorable body, but have not, as yet, received an answer. We, as citizens of the Cherokee Nation, claim our right. We claim a right to the ferry at the junction of the Coosawatie & Conesaugee Rivers, from occupancy; which right is derived, agreably to the custom and usages and laws of our nation and none can produce a better. Now the privilege of this ferry is taken away from us by arbitrary or illegal authority by Alexander McCoy. We want you to take the case into serious consideration and examine it minutely & we are well assured that you will do us justice and give us our rights. If it was not an indisputable right we would not ask it; but all we want is justice, as we have had a ferry boat at the place, before said McCoy moved to this place with assurances sufficient that the case will be properly investigated, we subscribe our names. \n                                                                                 Jessee Halfbreed\n                                                                                 Bosanallie\n                                                                                 Jas P.

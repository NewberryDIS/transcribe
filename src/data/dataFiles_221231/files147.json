Holyoke last evening - So Jane did not get  your letter - but it is so appropriate for her - I think I will send it, and a few words besides to her today or tomorrow morning.

Yesterday afternoon I had your letter, containing also the one from Jane & Anna - Poor girls - I was glad to see that they had not been hurt by that terrible hurricane. I have not yet had a letter from them, but expect one in a day or two at Granville in answer to mine from Tallmadge - How thankful we ought all to be as a family, that their lives were preserved at such an awful time. We have seen no danger at all on our journey so far. We went Monday to Paddy's Run about 20 or 22 miles in a covered Buggy - 4 of us - Mr. Edwards, Mr. Wm S. Griffiths and us both. preached in the evening - and again at 9 and at Paddy's Run 1\/2 past 1 - and in the evening at Cincinnati - It rained and rained almost without ceasing Monday afternoon and through the night.

Hampton, Mr B's study, Saturday afternoon Aug. 15.-\nMy dear Children - We have just received your first letter - we did not expect any till today - but today we hoped to get one - and our hope was realised. - thank you very much for it - Mother has just come up stairs after being down to show your letter to Elizabeth - & I think it is best for me to step aside and let Ma go on with this -\nI will go on a little longer as mother is gone to another room for a few minutes. We both feel quite well - mother is the most feeble, and does not seem to get over the weariness of the journey as well as I do.

Dec. 9. 1857\nDear Jane and Anna--\nThe mournful intelligence we have at last to communicate-- Our dear Lizzy is gone she died last Sabbath morning about 1\/4 past 3, and was burried yesterday afternoon. But we are not left without consolation-- she had spoken as one that loved the Savior, and had expressed a desire to make a public profession of his name-- if her life were spared. Your mother had spoken to her, and had prayed with her the last time she had been to see her-- also I had spoken some to her at another time. Her father had asked her sometime during last days if she tried to pray for herself-- she said that she did. He asked her, if she had some comfort in prayer and hoped the Lord heard her prayer. She said she did hope so, and had pleasure in prayer. Also she said she had no dread of death as she used to have. Thus calmly & hopefully did she leave all earthly scenes, to ascend as we trust to brighter scenes amid the ransomed of the Lord above. Dr Fowler deliverd a very affectionate address to the mourners and the congregation at the chapel of the First church and she was burried at the cemetery. I returned with Jane last evening-- mother, Sarah & Cynthia are to come home today. Mary did not come down from N. G. -- But intended to come to Utica and home on Thursday (tomorrow) she feared the excitement would be too much for her. Probably Sarah or Sis will stay for Mary till tomorrow when we hope to see her home again, somewhat improved in health. The family did not intend to follow the useless fashion of going to deep mourning~ \nMay we all listen to the warning given us as a family circle","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":34450,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/34450","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/9b60b090dc68bd86eaa99320bbc1a04a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/9b60b090dc68bd86eaa99320bbc1a04a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/9b60b090dc68bd86eaa99320bbc1a04a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9b60b090dc68bd86eaa99320bbc1a04a.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T15:36:18+00:00","modified":"2020-09-23T13:38:32+00:00","filename":"9b60b090dc68bd86eaa99320bbc1a04a.jpg","authentication":"b2ebb1e33d1b46586fdf61e349e0b769","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_01_fl_007_004_02_o2.jpg","size":1006821,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2337,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.03989052916844999796541770820113015361130237579345703125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["013806"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160301"],"DigitalCreationTime":["013806"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["013806"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160301"],"DigitalCreationTime":["013806"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["013806"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160301"],"DigitalCreationTime":["013806"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"9b60b090dc68bd86eaa99320bbc1a04a.jpg","FileDateTime":1507735967,"FileSize":1006821,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2337\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2337,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:06:10 11:26:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:01 01:38:06","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:01 01:38:06","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":24,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":147,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/147","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"we feel as if a beloved daughter and sister had left us.

Copy please on marked part  \/annotation\nRemsen Feb. 22 1856\nMy Dear Daughter Jane\nWe have lately had two or three letters from you, and were quite sorry that you had been so long kept in suspense and in such anxiety with reference to your brother Robert's sickness-- before you heard that he was better. The way it happened (I think) was this-- After our first letter by Sissy, I wrote, I think it was the next day-- But snow storms then commenced to come, and for several days the cars could not go-- and the mail stopped. I feared then that our second letter could not reach you for several days after the first one. Robert + Mary are in New Graefenberg since a week ago last Monday (11th). He is getting better as you will see by the inclosed letters from them which we got yesterday. We had a letter yesterday also from John, quite a brief one-- in which he says Sarah had not had chills since they had written the week before. and she had then been free from the chills for three or four days-- so this would make about 10 days since she had had any chills. Frankey was quite well.  John's health was improving. Yesterday was our Donation day. The roads were very bad, with snow drifts-- the last Sabbath having been such that I was notable to go to Penymynyd-- Still we had quite a company though not nearly as crowded in the evening as you have seen in former times. The Donation in money was $196-- goods about $16. Some of this, of course, would have come in as contributions or salary, if we had not had the D--n-- Still it was a good Donation considering this state of the roads-- Mr J.W. Roberts was as active and faithful as ever. He frequently asks whether we have heard from Jane-- and want to be remembered to you. All of us joining in love to you I rem your affect father\nRobert Everett\nI wrote to Rev. J. Williams, Palmyra - to thank him for the affection him and his family had shown to my beloved daughter and I received a very kind letter from him in return-- they seem to have been much pleased with the visit-- and Mr. W. spoke very respectfully indeed of your school and of the feelings of your friends with reference to it at Hudson.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":34453,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/34453","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f977b08b9c849d4a641b9ff470561987.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f977b08b9c849d4a641b9ff470561987.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f977b08b9c849d4a641b9ff470561987.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f977b08b9c849d4a641b9ff470561987.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T15:36:24+00:00","modified":"2020-09-23T13:52:55+00:00","filename":"f977b08b9c849d4a641b9ff470561987.jpg","authentication":"5b57362b82e3b3004a26573addcd7328","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_01_fl_007_006_01_o2.jpg","size":1029696,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2282,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041780114908948999541404845103897969238460063934326171875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["013823"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160301"],"DigitalCreationTime":["013823"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["013823"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160301"],"DigitalCreationTime":["013823"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["013823"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160301"],"DigitalCreationTime":["013823"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f977b08b9c849d4a641b9ff470561987.jpg","FileDateTime":1507735967,"FileSize":1029696,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2282\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2282,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:06:10 11:28:15","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:01 01:38:23","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:01 01:38:23","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":147,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/147","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Remsen Jan. 1, 1859\nDear Jannie and Sis;\nMay I write to you both at once?

Lewis had returned on Saturday, a week ago last Saturday - Your mother remained there a little over one week. They reached on Friday eve (the 9th) Sarah was much fatigued and had spasms rather bad - the following day Saturday had spasms much worse - but was better the following day, and on Monday was comfortable, and from that day has been under treatment. Your mother has considerable confidence in Dr. Strong and his wife, and in their treatment. Sarah was rather improving in some things - and had not had any more of the spasms. - She felt happy in her new situation, surrounded by many affectionate and sympathysing friends. Let us try to remember her in our daily supplication, at the throne of grace, to which I hope and trust, Dear John, you are not an entire stranger. Your mother seems about as well as when she left home. We continue in the family the plan of having subjects to recite verses on - the one last week was \"Benevolence\" - this week \"the future state\". Your letter from Auburn I recvd the following day, after you wrote - and on the morning following (Friday I think or Thursday) I sent it on with a few lines from myself - to Philadelphia. I shall be expecting daily now for an answer - it may come this evening. - If it comes today or tomorrow I will forward it to you, care of Rev. Thos Evans, Youngstown - if later, I will send to meet you at Pittsburgh, Care of Mister D. E. Evans. We are getting along tolerably well with Cenhadwr - Did not commence setting till the 5th having had to clean and white wash the office. today we are printing the last face of 1st Form - and have 2 galleys towards next form set - Anna helps some. Gth Jones is with us today howing potatoes. Lewis & Eddy ploughed them on Saturday. We are all well at home - had a letter a few days ago from Iarthryn? Gwyned - he is going to leave for America with his family in August. Sold one U.T.C.? to Levi James, yesterday. Hope you will be careful of your health - not to be too ardent, and work too hard.

We are writing today to Sarah Maria. I have a $10 bill in the house and will send it to her, and get the same amount again of Robert - so that will be as payment of $10 from Robert. I think I will send today a few numbers for July to Mr D. E. Evans and also to Mr. D Edwards, and will pay the postage of these two parcels, that they may have them in hand to use, if called for. - I think it is best to let them get subscribers than for you to do it. - I am sending this to Ebensburg, where it will meet you I hope in safety. Try all you can to talk Welsh - the Welsh people will love to hear Welsh talk, though it be broken, - and using will rub off the rust. - I will try to find the portrait and the cut you mentioned, and send them. I will write to Mr. Edwards and Mr Evans. - Please write often. - You can tell better than we can with reference to the Atlas. Perhaps if you do not see it best to take it, you had better drop them a line to give the reason of your declining. - We mailed the Cenhadwr on Saturday. Sent you a No. - We had one letter from Sarah since your mother came home - She was comfortable, and hopeful. It was written by some friend for her. We hope to have a letter again from her - perhaps this eveng. - I will write again to meet you at Pittsburgh care of D E Evans - We all join in love to you. - Your affectionate father   Robt Everett.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":34462,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/34462","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/1a693ac5f94b8a48bbd196edf5ca4722.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/1a693ac5f94b8a48bbd196edf5ca4722.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/1a693ac5f94b8a48bbd196edf5ca4722.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1a693ac5f94b8a48bbd196edf5ca4722.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T15:36:44+00:00","modified":"2020-08-11T14:27:12+00:00","filename":"1a693ac5f94b8a48bbd196edf5ca4722.jpg","authentication":"69c82b77e3dca72ff479751aa1e45494","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_01_fl_009_001_01_o2.jpg","size":993006,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2371,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.038778996204132998304459079008665867149829864501953125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["032906"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["032906"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["032906"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1a693ac5f94b8a48bbd196edf5ca4722.jpg","FileDateTime":1507735967,"FileSize":993006,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2371\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2371,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"9mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:03:02 10:50:02","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:01 03:29:06","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:01 03:29:06","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1590,"ExifImageLength":2414,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":147,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/147","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"My Dear Son Lewis -\n\n Please have the following acknowledged on Day Book - & on cover of July No. -\n\nx John R.

This last storm seemed to vie with its predecessors in sublimity and grandeur. I failed to go to Penymnydd last Sabbath - did not attempt it - mother and the girls would not let me try - there was so little hope that I could get through if I had started - and it was rough and very cold. Today is calm and pleasant - almost as if the harbinger of opening spring weather. We are quite anxious to hear how Robert is, and Mary also. Hope there will be a letter or two from you this afternoon - we have had no mail since Saturday. The office folks are getting along very well - all quite busy - the first 16 pages have been printed and the 2nd form of 8 pages are being printed today - and most of next form has been set.

 June 29. 1848\n\nDear Sarah.   It is now about a week since you went to that awful place as you call it. probably it seems somewhat less awful now than at first.  Sure it is, I could not see anything so very dismal about it, on the contrary  I think it quite a desirable location if one is out of health, indeed, I should like to be with you there this minute, and would if I could fly. Should like nothing better. Suppose you have become quite initiated into baths, and sheets, and packs, by this time, though you could give me an introduction should I visit you?  Jane has gone home and you do not know how lonely it seems here. And Sarah too gone, it seems as though we had lost half of the house. Robert brought me today some of the nicest milk, wish you and Mother could be here that I might make you some good sweet custard. Have you moved into your nice little room in the third story yet?  Wish I could drop in this afternoon and see how you look. our house is getting along slowly - it will be a month yet probably before we can get settled.The term is about closing up at the Seminary - the students are beginning to scatter. Write to me soon and tell me all about yourself.  Your affectionate Sister  Elisabeth\n\nwritten on left side and across top:\nSat morn. I've received your very welcome notes this morning. Am glad to learn that you are both getting more contented. Wish you could have reported more decided improvement in your health, though in a short time we could not expect a great change. Have just been making some pumpkin pies with that milk that Robert brought, wish I could send you some. But I suppose you think that water is better than all the pumpkins and everything else that you can think of\n\nBut it is time that this should go to the office. Hope you will get it today.

Jane & Mary left Utica as I understood from John at 10 o'clock Friday morng, and expected to be at Mt Holyoke that evening - Probably you will receive a letter from them before this reaches you. We have not had one as yet. Robert came home with John on Saturday evening - and both went off again to Utica yesterday Morning. John  wanted to go for some iron bar for the office - expect him back this evening - though it is uncertain, as it is now about tea time. Your Ma is in Whitesboro since a week today - have not heard from them since Saturday - your sister was comfortable there. and the baby doing well. Our family looks quite small now - only Anna & Eddy of our folks today, and Mary Jones, and the boys and Mr. Davies in the office. We feel cheered to hear from you time to time that you are \"some better\" - since your general health is gradually improving I feel that we ought to be very thankful - and that is all we can now expect. When you gain a little more strength I am expecting your spine complaint will yield gradually to the treatment - am glad your courage is kept up so well. Look to the Lord, dear daughter, for his blessing - We don't forget you before the throne of grace in the closet or in the family - hope you can cast all your burden on the Lord, and cheerfully confide in his wisdom and goodness, with reference to health and all things. I am anxiously looking for John's return that I may have something to say about them in Whitesboro.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":34495,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/34495","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/1c2f4a6b4351193607de93be6303d224.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/1c2f4a6b4351193607de93be6303d224.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/1c2f4a6b4351193607de93be6303d224.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1c2f4a6b4351193607de93be6303d224.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T15:38:03+00:00","modified":"2020-09-23T15:47:28+00:00","filename":"1c2f4a6b4351193607de93be6303d224.jpg","authentication":"d5dd00a3bba05d4cac103158093d1a29","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_01_fl_012_003_02_o2.jpg","size":1277630,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2373,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04985211718250100176863526257875491864979267120361328125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["033333"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["033333"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["033333"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1c2f4a6b4351193607de93be6303d224.jpg","FileDateTime":1507735968,"FileSize":1277630,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2373\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2373,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:03:02 10:51:34","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:01 03:33:33","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:01 03:33:33","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":94,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2534,"ExifImageLength":3843,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":147,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/147","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"- but probably he will not come tonight - it is now near ten.

We have been much interested in the company of Mr Butler an getting an account of you all as a family, as well as of his tour, I hope that he may return to his native land in safety having had his health greatly invigorated,","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":34507,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/34507","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/6cae70f5d4b0e851e2c83d8dd70ac0f0.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/6cae70f5d4b0e851e2c83d8dd70ac0f0.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/6cae70f5d4b0e851e2c83d8dd70ac0f0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6cae70f5d4b0e851e2c83d8dd70ac0f0.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T15:38:32+00:00","modified":"2020-09-23T18:02:47+00:00","filename":"6cae70f5d4b0e851e2c83d8dd70ac0f0.jpg","authentication":"46be842c04d7a4d5037dd450380e820a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_01_fl_014_001_03_o2.jpg","size":1218351,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2321,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048604169658672001508303850414449698291718959808349609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["033500"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160301"],"DigitalCreationTime":["033500"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["033500"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160301"],"DigitalCreationTime":["033500"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160301"],"TimeCreated":["033500"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160301"],"DigitalCreationTime":["033500"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6cae70f5d4b0e851e2c83d8dd70ac0f0.jpg","FileDateTime":1507735969,"FileSize":1218351,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2321\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2321,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:06:10 11:32:53","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:01 03:35:00","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:01 03:35:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":84,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":147,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/147","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"We feel it natural when we come in contact with any Publication from America, the Cenhadwr or anything else, to look for the names of our relative there, I assure you, we feel a warm attachment towards you all as a family, although we have been so very dilatory in writing  I enjoyed the company of Mr. Roberts when he was over last year and thought much of writing with him then but delay I did.

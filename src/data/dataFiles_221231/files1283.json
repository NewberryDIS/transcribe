Elyria Tuesday Eve.\n\nMy Dearest\nI have just written a letter to Rev J. N. Newton in reply to one from him asking for coal. Last night wrote one to L.L. Jenkins in reply to one from him. He is established at Boston you know. Your letter of the 13th came to hand this evening. The Boys and myself wrote a big letter to you Sunday night, mailed yesterday morning, which after some hesitation I directed to Pembroke;  thinking it would not get around before Thursday, and that by that time you would be there rather than at Yarmouth. I wrote much about going East, or rather not going, and mostly concluding it was hardly best to try to go. If I went I should hardly feel like staying more than the finest possible day, to go and come in, and perhaps it would hardly be worth the while if you could come back alone or with Samuel or somehow. \nThere would seem to be no difficulty about the Children, or about any one of them in particular at any rate. Wilder could go up to Charles'. or over to Mr. Twiss, Charley to Dr. DeWitts or half a dozen other places; he has a first class invitation to go down to Boyds' on the Lake Shore. Geo Boyd you know is an especial Chum of his. Anna could stay at Twiss' or anywhere else; would be good and slight trouble any where; and Little Don John, could go to Eliab, or Eliza could take","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102950,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102950","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ff0cae775595599c565ba6037f502282.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ff0cae775595599c565ba6037f502282.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ff0cae775595599c565ba6037f502282.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ff0cae775595599c565ba6037f502282.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:07:55+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:05+00:00","filename":"ff0cae775595599c565ba6037f502282.jpg","authentication":"e3d1334a8cc26dcbfd9d82a0d1553b12","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_187_025_002_o2.jpg","size":1414904,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2883,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.045442119191686003443209074248443357646465301513671875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["034228"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["034228"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["034228"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ff0cae775595599c565ba6037f502282.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812065,"FileSize":1414904,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2883\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2883,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:34:46","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:01 03:42:28","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:01 03:42:28","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":39,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3040,"ExifImageLength":3796,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1283,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1283","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"the best of care of him here.

Yesterday P.M. 4 oclock, took horse & buggy & took children to ride - John & Anna & drove up to Charles' where Wilder & Charley were making hay very smartly.

No letter came, but Mary Barber did come arriving from Sandusky on the afternoon train However joyfully she might be welcomed, it is suspected by the cynical that a letter from yourself might have been equally welcome. Miss Barber attended a Prayer Meeting at the Baptist Church this forenoon I understand. However she was not especially missed at the Stone Church, where a quite full house was assembled to hear the Rev Theodore Holmes of East Hartford, who preached to beautiful acceptance, and also addressed the Sabbath School and also the infant class. Mr Holmes is quite a handsome young man, appearing some 10 or 15 yrs under his reputed age, rather short but quite muscular with a bright sharp blue eye. I imagine he will take well, though perhaps not very much of a preacher, but evidently an energetic live man.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102967,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102967","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c6e3eb0ac167d148c22fad560dce881a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c6e3eb0ac167d148c22fad560dce881a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c6e3eb0ac167d148c22fad560dce881a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c6e3eb0ac167d148c22fad560dce881a.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:08:17+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:05+00:00","filename":"c6e3eb0ac167d148c22fad560dce881a.jpg","authentication":"e738598c756bee5b263ccbabca145126","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_187_031_002_o2.jpg","size":1453233,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2897,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046447570283434998217320099911376019008457660675048828125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["034436"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["034436"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["034436"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c6e3eb0ac167d148c22fad560dce881a.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812066,"FileSize":1453233,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2897\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2897,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:35:24","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:01 03:44:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:01 03:44:36","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":19,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3106,"ExifImageLength":3859,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1283,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1283","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Children are all finely.\nLittle Don John is in fine health feels better and sleeps better I think than he has since you went away.

You must had had a fine time in many respects, but I am afraid you got too tired and used up.\n\nLast Sunday you know Mr. Holmes preached here, and today, (Mr. Holmes could stop but one Sunday), Mr. Kenyon preached again. He is very much liked by many of the people; he really is a fine preacher.

But if you should not come this week, you might like another letter. We are all in good health & spirits.\nI wrote you a day or two since that you need not go to Hartford as Hattie DeWitt Gaylord was expected here daily. I guess they expected her last night but she did not come I think. I sent you last week a P.O. Money order for $20.00, and two or three Photographs of John.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102984,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102984","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b6c6b9a0a0a6bd6d6cd7565968b1bb2f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b6c6b9a0a0a6bd6d6cd7565968b1bb2f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b6c6b9a0a0a6bd6d6cd7565968b1bb2f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b6c6b9a0a0a6bd6d6cd7565968b1bb2f.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:08:38+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:05+00:00","filename":"b6c6b9a0a0a6bd6d6cd7565968b1bb2f.jpg","authentication":"9436d14dc8e7e0a154f8dd5b6738251c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_187_037_002_o2.jpg","size":1395233,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2846,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0453929166341320022848293547212961129844188690185546875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["034640"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["034640"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["034640"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b6c6b9a0a0a6bd6d6cd7565968b1bb2f.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812067,"FileSize":1395233,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2846\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2846,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:36:01","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:01 03:46:40","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:01 03:46:40","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3041,"ExifImageLength":3846,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1283,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1283","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Mr. Wilbur preached this morning from \"The Peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you\" Closing with very fervent invocations of blessing and peace, there were many tearful faces among his Audience.

Business depression always follows near; and the results even of the Mexican War will undoubtedly have great effect, even in parts so remote from the principal scene of action. In a pecuniary point of view merely, War may be compared to a sort of National \"Spree\", perhaps borrowing money to go off gambling, or to a horse race; The depression which follows with peace is the going to work again to pay up the debts incurred.

I am interested in watching the present Revolutions in Europe as the development in great measure of a new principle, as the type of a New Era in European history. They are the outbreak of labor, instead of Money. Formerly in Europe as every where, the Warrior held sway, the sword ruled with the kind & the baron who weilded the sword. In former revolutions Money asserted its power; the Merchant the citizen rose up against the Baron, the peer: the purse claimed precedence power with or above the sword.\nIt was somewhat so even in the Revolution of this country; varied true by the peculiar character & influences of the people. Ye Monet was the Case. France illustrates the point. In former revolutions, in 1790 or 1830, it was the \"Bourgeois\", the citizen, the man of property, who rebelled and cast down the government, the government of the sword.\nIn February, in Paris, as it has been in Germany & Italy; it was an other, a lower which lifted up the head: one ho was hardly thought worthy of Notice before. This is the revolution of the \"the Man in the blouse.\" of the laborer, rather than of the Bourgeoise.   Before it was only the Merchant threw the Money bag into the seale against the sword and weighed it down. The Man in the blouse perhaps fared little better under the Merchant, than under the Baron.  But here, as I read if saw a real incident in one of the German States, the Blouse man himself, before only the instrument of others. a big blacksmith stretched out his bony arm and laid his calling hand upon the shoulder of the Prince, demanding, & obtaining too, a Constitution!

You know the old saw that \"This is a great world.\" Well, in some respects, this here is rather a great part of the world. Northern Illinois is called by Eastern people mostly, Southern by a sprinkling of every thing, mostly south of New York. Where I am boarding Penn. Dutch. Very many are from Tenn. & Ky. Take them together, a very curious set of people. A mile apart in the closest neighborhood a known, (I expect forms a Village! Every one farms an immense amount of land, and pastures the whole surrounding country.\n\nWhere we are now, eight or ten miles across Muddy River Valley is Timber. Farms are about as plenty in the Timber as any where but I guess such a thing as felling a tree was never known here. The trees are girdled, and stand or fall till they rot. A farm is a forest of dead trees. The Crops raised are {Wheat. $.50 per bu.\n{Corn      .25 \"     \"\n{Oats      .25  '    \"\n{Castor Beans  .50  \" \" sometimes $1.00 or more\nBoth Tobacco & Cotton are also raised some. Peaches are the principal fruit, but this year unfortunately for me they were killed by frost.\n\n Yesterday I worked through a Corn field where the Corn stood 8 to 10 ft. high, just ready to topel. Ears are sometimes found 10 ft from the ground. I presume though it yeilds no more than smaller corn. One or two ears in a hill, 3 or four ft. apart both ways, no hoeing, plough and cross plough through it several times.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102998,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102998","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/0c75a0228d63b6b1df013410f1652364.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/0c75a0228d63b6b1df013410f1652364.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/0c75a0228d63b6b1df013410f1652364.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0c75a0228d63b6b1df013410f1652364.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:08:55+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:05+00:00","filename":"0c75a0228d63b6b1df013410f1652364.jpg","authentication":"35dfa3642f6db52ec3a808a01505a494","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_189_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1592989,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2854,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05168149316099600321106066758147790096700191497802734375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["030817"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["030817"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["030817"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0c75a0228d63b6b1df013410f1652364.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812068,"FileSize":1592989,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2854\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2854,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:36:39","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:08:17","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:08:17","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":69,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3097,"ExifImageLength":3906,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1283,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1283","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"My first work here commenced upon Muddy River, in a little Cane Brake, at a Sweet Gum Tree; thence to a Post Oak Tree.

The great bulk of the Timber {All Woodland is called Timber here} is Post Oak, with some Pin Oak, and Black Oak, abundant Hickory, some Gum, Persimmon etc. Cotton Wood, Sycamore & that clan in the River Bottoms.  Beside there are much Locust, and some Plum trees etc. wild in the woods.\nPlants & Flowers are various and abundant.\nThere is no such thing known as any of the Pine or Fir family, no black growth. All hard wood every where.\nThe houses are Log, hewn or unhewn, and built in a fashion to make a Yankee stare. Poor folks have one room only. no matter if 20 in family. Those better off, that is those whose farms all worth say more than $5000.00 have 2 rooms, never more.\nThey are all built alike the 2 rooms are 2 houses just alike, 8 to or 12 feet apart, with one roof extending over both and the intermediate space, which in other respects is all open, This called \"the Porch, is the principal place where the people live always eat & sit there. And really at this season at least, they are certainly the most comfortable places I ever found under a roof. Always a current of air through.\nWhere I now board, at a house of this kind, 2 large rooms & Porch, very good specimen of the class; wealthy Dutch Farmer, family of 12 to 20.

I should not have minded stopping the Party while I wrote it, but the expense of sending a man off to Post Office express 8 or 10 miles with it would have been perhaps $2. or 3.00 and add to this the extreme probability that if it arrived at the P.O. that evening it would get started before tomorrow morning. In short, it was best to wait.\nYou expected a letter from me at Woonsocket. Well, you do not yet realize how far out of the world I am, nor the difficulties in the was of the rapid transmission of intelligence to certain portions of our Country. I did not receive your letter requesting me to write to Woonsocket until Aug. 9. 1851, more than a week as you perceive after you left Woonsocket. If I had written immediately to Woonsocket, it would probably have arrived there sometime early in September. Again you will perceive { if you ever have a chance} the great impossibility of your ever receiving this letter in Westfield. So it will probably reach there sometime in September.\n\n  The first letter I received from Maine, the first I heard from there after I left there in May last, was I think Aug. 6 or 7, when I received one from you, enclosing one from Alabama, and merely stating that you had all written week or two before. Moreover that you hoped Lucy was a little better than she had been. Well I did not know whether to think she was very sick or not. But two or three days after came other letters written a week or two before, and I have got one written by Lucy just after you left Bangor.\n\nYou can hardly imagine how much better I have felt since. I believe I have written to Anne twice since I came here, but have not yet received any thing from there.\nTo Bangor or Milo I have written or intended I intend to write about every week.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103006,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103006","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/0ec86962524456ab6d9c0a62b81ca281.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/0ec86962524456ab6d9c0a62b81ca281.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/0ec86962524456ab6d9c0a62b81ca281.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0ec86962524456ab6d9c0a62b81ca281.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:09:05+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:05+00:00","filename":"0ec86962524456ab6d9c0a62b81ca281.jpg","authentication":"7bfc89db273dcc673f8b28e68bc52de1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_189_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1312953,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2382,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051036827129396000746197614716948010027408599853515625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031002"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031002"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031002"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"0ec86962524456ab6d9c0a62b81ca281.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812068,"FileSize":1312953,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2382\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2382,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:36:57","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:10:02","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:10:02","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":84,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3253,"ExifImageLength":4916,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1283,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1283","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Moss E.

Enquire how he succeeded last winter, 8 month, with that great school of 100+ Oldtown rowdies; cripple as he is, had hardly stood up since. \n\nIt is too bad for such a fellow as he is, or might be, to lose a leg, mutitate such a peice of timber.\n\n Philips Exeter, by his report, must be a place for Severe discipline, thorough scholarship, & great advantages. 3 teachers No. of students limited to 72. Charity students, preferred, smart ones. Richly funded, Thousand dollars dont know but more, distributed in prizes, per annum. Large libraries, every thing right.\n\nHad not you or Eliab better try to go there. Barker says there is no difficulty in admittance in Charity, for one good scholar etc. Almost advised me to go there. Old & advanced as I am. by him discipline is about equal to a College course, common.\nI dont know but the Abstract of News which with I have fits this paper will be interesting to you or not.

I am afraid that you are not a very good hand to write letters to your brethren.\n I think that such Correspondence ought to be kept up. It is one most important method of keeping up, of preserving in all their freshness & fervor, of cultivating & strengthening, those feelings of friendship, fraternal affection & communion, which are certainly the best part of our poor human nature. The cultivation of the heart is no less important, than that of the mind. The affectionate interchange of thoughts & feelings, of joy & sorrow, of trials & pleasures, is the greatest, perhaps we might say almost the only source of all the happiness we have, which is purely sublunary. The pleasures of sense alone are and must ever be to the thinking mind - worthless- in comparison at least.\n\nThe others however could hardly be called of this world merely. They are so closely connected with those which take hold of another and a better, happier sphere.\nExcuse this involuntary episode. I began upon the advantages of letter writing especially when friends & brothers are necessarily far separated. Surely  in such a subject, the mere expense, the postage, the paltry dimes, this world's drops, ought not to be considered, even though it were much more than it is. Even the intellectual advantage alone would much more than balance that.  Besides postage comes down. \n\n I really want for the first thing that you should write me a full, great letter, about yourself, and all about Foxcroft.  You know I have lived there more than a year, and naturally feel interested there. My correspondents are there are not worth much, or not really ? I.G.

I see the school is larger than ever before. How is Miss Smith? Write me about every body I know & every body I dont know. Who is that Chum of yours that talks politics so badly? How does Francis Mitchell? And the Chum who will come here next fall? & D. Anderson & N.S. Carpenter & old Chandler, Greely & Philbrick? Robinson, Smart etc. And the Ladies? -do you not get acquainted with them? you ought to. There are many there where acquaintance cannot but be profitable to any young man. If in any matter of conduct, I have erred to my heart, it has been in keeping myself from the society & acquaintance of the better sex, too much. You had chance to get acquainted with Sarah Holmes & Mary Tower & others last spring, but did not much, and I fear do not now. I believe they attend & Miss Carpenter & Hopkins & the Treats & others. Remember, now is the proper time of life to form acquaintances, and friends for life. Do you know the folks down to Cockran's? How is Mr. Parker this spring? I believe I must write to him soon. On what terms is Mr. Tash with him now?\nIs there any interest on the subject of religion at Foxcroft, this spring?\n\n We do hope that the blessed Spirit of God has been granted to us somewhat here. There has been no excitement, but considerable seriousness, and it is  hoped some souls born into the kingdom of God.  About the time I returned, came one, who was much a rowdy last fall; he seemed very still, swore not; and it was soon whispered that 'Thornton\" had experienced religion; Soon that others were serious, several of the 'best fellows' in College, & especially in our class.\n\nJasper Whiting, son of the commanding officer at Houlton, who is about the loveliest fellow I ever knew, The idol of our class, without an enemy, beloved by every one, excelling in every thing too, and as every one said 'so good', he went mourning about for two or three weeks, punctual every where, but with a countenance of deepest distress. When he smiled again, the joy that beamed from his eye was eloquent indeed. Many could not help thinking, that is 'the Major', as Whiting was always called, if he needed a change of heart, & was thus cast down for his sins, he who was, in the ideas of students - 'so good': when no one thought of ever having an ill feeling,","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103022,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103022","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/66ecd01ff9b9021210ea8b7da00e4207.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/66ecd01ff9b9021210ea8b7da00e4207.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/66ecd01ff9b9021210ea8b7da00e4207.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/66ecd01ff9b9021210ea8b7da00e4207.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:09:26+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:05+00:00","filename":"66ecd01ff9b9021210ea8b7da00e4207.jpg","authentication":"eae5d91ac2284591a72a1056f0da547c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_191_002_003_o2.jpg","size":1670286,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2961,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0522310405643739983361228951252996921539306640625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031320"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031320"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031320"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"66ecd01ff9b9021210ea8b7da00e4207.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812069,"FileSize":1670286,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2961\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2961,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:37:44","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:13:20","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:13:20","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3219,"ExifImageLength":3913,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1283,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1283","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"the best example of the amiability of the Natural heart, what must be the case with others.

Coll. June 11th. 1844 crossed out\n\nDear Brother\n\n  I was gratified by receiving a letter from you, with two others from Lucy & Eliab, last Tuesday, June 7th, by the hand of E.L. Brown, for which please recept my heartiest thanks. As to your charge of 'aggravated misconduct in neglecting to write\" if I am obliged to plead guilty 'de factor', I shall take the  liberty to recommend myself strongly to mercy, on the ground that I was entirely ignorant where to direct a letter to you. I heard you had been at Bangor, were going to Oldtown, thought of going to Boston, might go to Rutland, and I knew there was such a place as Mlilo. After receiving your letter. I wrote six or seven to the family at Milo & Bangor; and when I got back from Boston. I wrote one in a very large sheet of wrapping paper 12 by 20 inches, and  very well filled out too. You may consider yourself 'saved from deliverance' that you did not have to read it.  If you want to know about my visit to Boston however, Lucy I believe read it, & can tell you of it. \n I am glad my letter arrived soon enough to prevent you from sending me any money by Brown, as on account of Mrs. Childs' benificence. I get along pleasantly without it.  I am very much obliged to you for your good wishes & your kind intentions in taking mercy on my pecuniary necessities.  I am getting along quite comfortably in such matters now, and I think prospects re fair for me to get along & get through now.

Coll. July 4th, 1845\n\nDear Brother\n\n   I was gratified the other day, Wed. July 2d by receiving a letter from you. It was, to me, the first fruits of the new postage law. It was of course but single postage, 5 cents. The new postage depends only on the weight. If in twenty peices a letter is only single postage if it weighs less than 1\/2 oz.  The heaviest letter paper you ever saw probably does not weigh over 5\/16 oz.  So you can always send 1 1\/2 sheets single. Such paper as this I think 2 sheets. At any rate they have letter paper advertised 4 & 5 sheets to the 1\/2 oz. It pleases Students finely to received letters containing a fine fold of bank bills at single postage. Many such come preparatory to the glorious Fourth. The Students are about half gone today, some to Boston, some to Portland, Saco and every where else in this part of the State. Men are here perhaps for the rain yesterday, but most of them will go this afternoon over to Topsham, down to Harpswell, or the salt water or Somewhere. I, for poverty, expect to remain here,\n\nThere is to be a grand fair. Young Ladies fair, here, this eve. Object, help build the new church.  I shall make an excuse for not attending that, being for such a purpose, it is held in a hall belonging to a Rum Tavern. There was one last term in Commons Hall; but I went not.\n\n Your letter was quite interesting, but some part of it, related more to your business, private & auction sales, commissions, consignments, and so forth than to yourself, circumstances and feelings, or the state of your brethren. Not to say that the former was not interesting to me; anything whatever connected with you or your circumstances","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103029,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103029","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/15be2c91bb11709384b58bce1244e3b8.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/15be2c91bb11709384b58bce1244e3b8.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/15be2c91bb11709384b58bce1244e3b8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/15be2c91bb11709384b58bce1244e3b8.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:09:37+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:05+00:00","filename":"15be2c91bb11709384b58bce1244e3b8.jpg","authentication":"52a9b2f9f93b5770f199c4efe9799b64","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_191_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1654771,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2890,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053017140843264996818984258197815506719052791595458984375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031432"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031432"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031432"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"15be2c91bb11709384b58bce1244e3b8.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812069,"FileSize":1654771,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2890\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2890,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:38:02","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:14:32","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:14:32","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3107,"ExifImageLength":3870,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1283,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1283","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"must of course be interesting to me, and grateful received; but I should have been glad to hear more particularly about your own circumstances and prospects.

Coll. July 20th ' 45\n\nDear Brother\n\n  I sent letters to you & Lucy, about a week ago; but perhaps the one to you was hardly an equivalent for the last I received from you; therefore the late ceremonies of laying the corner stone of the new chapel afford a pretty good theme of communication. I will try to write a letter today, and give you some account of them.  The cornerstone of the Chapel was laid on Wednesday, July 16th. with Masonic honors. I think likely it is the first that I know it great public building which has been thus founded since the great excitement against Masonry some years ago, which apparently destroyed the whole system, though now it seems showing itself again in full vigor.\n\nIt was done in in honor of Ex.

My chum is sick and gone away, while I ring the bell for him: if he does not return, I have it which is about $8.00 or 8.50.\n\n  I may perhaps get a dollar or two by sale of my Sophomore Books  But I ought to spend 8 or 10.00 immediately for Junior Books.\n   I had a letter from Mr. Tash this morning, in answer to one I wrote him lately. I wrote something about going there this fall if he wanted me. He wrote that he should like much to have me some there, but it seems that he could not do much for me. Holbrook it appears I guess is engaged to help him some, and he wants me there too. It would be probably some advantage to him to have me there, Make the School popular, Name on the Catalogue two assistants etc. etc. etc.\n\nI hardly know as it will be best for me to go there though although it would be very pleasant. It is a more pleasant place in many accounts than College, and I should know how to enjoy it, better perhaps than I did there before.\n\n But you see my tuition and room rent are going on here just the same as if I were present. That would be about $12.00 perhaps more. It would cost me no more for clothes here than there, and I could earn something, perhaps most","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103039,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103039","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/a93e65ef7cedc3ea28d047810c09a11d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/a93e65ef7cedc3ea28d047810c09a11d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/a93e65ef7cedc3ea28d047810c09a11d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a93e65ef7cedc3ea28d047810c09a11d.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:09:51+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:05+00:00","filename":"a93e65ef7cedc3ea28d047810c09a11d.jpg","authentication":"704bbb7bce008a27684b5dfc7a1c347a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_191_006_006_o2.jpg","size":1675505,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2895,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05358872257404199979102799034080817364156246185302734375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031647"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031647"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031647"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a93e65ef7cedc3ea28d047810c09a11d.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812070,"FileSize":1675505,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2895\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2895,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:38:26","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:16:47","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:16:47","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3093,"ExifImageLength":3846,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1283,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1283","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"6\n\nas much as I should there. $10 or 15.00 probably, enough to pay my board, and possibly I might not do much better there.

Coll. Aug. 7th 1845\n\nDear Brother\n\n   I received your letter day before yesterday. I have just written a letter to Sister Lucy in answer to one I received a while since, and believe I shall enclose it to you, As it is just as cheap, and perhaps she would get it more conveniently from you than if directed to herself.\n I have about concluded to stay here this fall at any rate, it will be a great advantage to me at any rate, in many respects, and I had better stay here somehow, if I cannot get a chance to earn considerable somewhere, to help me along another year, and I dont see as I am likely to.\n\nI should like now to be here at the beginning of the next term and stay a spell, if not more than four weeks, if I could then get a winter school to begin by the first of Nov. so as to end by the beginning of the spring term, it would just exactly suit me.\n\n Our Examination is three weeks from last Wednesday Aug 6th., but my business, as Treasurer of Athenaean, and Steward of Boarding Club, require rather imperiously, my presence here Commencement week or I should come home then. If I go home it will be Sept. 5th, getting into Bangor Sat. Sept. 6th, probably.  I dont know but it would be better then to stay, even the three weeks, and would cost less, if I could find nothing to do to earn any thing here.

Jumped right in, without eating. Eat at Lewiston 4 clock. Lewiston is beautiful place, falls & most picturesque I ever saw. rambled about,  came home in evening. Thursday, Freshman Examination. Eve. their supper. Freshman Bonfire, Quarrell with Prof. Forsyth about it. It did not get to burning till past 3.

I have got a Coat for $13.00, a hat for $3.00  After this week, direct letters to me to Turner or Turner Village, and write frequently besides, do ye hear?\n\n   I received a letter from Milo on Aug. 23d from you on the 25th and another on the 30th.\n As for your passages Mat. 16 - 22&3 And Peter took him and began (word in Greek looks like iemiereimav?) to blame, or reproach, or sometimes V. 7 strictly enjoin simple future strong negative him, saying, be favorable to thyself, Lord; this will by no mean be to you. But he having turned round, said to Peter, (word in Greek looks like vpaye) steal away, or withdraw, or go away, (word in Greek looks like oriso) behind (nothing else) me, Satan ( call to suit yourself), (word in Greek looks like sxavsahov noa ei) you are my stumbling block, or cause of offence: because you word in Greek looks like psoveie understand not the things of God, but the things of men. I know no better translation of word in Greek looks like psoveie, than understand, you see it differs from our version, aso last of 22 verse. The word word in Greek looks like vrraye, Upage, Sup. of upago, I think is not susceptible of the meaning, follow, or come after. I have no critical knowledge of the N.T. Greek, but if it was so used even there, my Lexicon would show 'Matthew' has no 18th verse! It is a familiar passage, but I have no Concordance at hand, & dont find it. John 3, 18 & 19th verses together attain something like those words. The words rendered judge and condemn, judgment & condemnation, are Greek noun word in Greek looks like xeisis, and verb word in Greek looks like xeivos seem successful of both meanings.\nI am not critical enough, especially on Bible greek to decide.  The word word in Greek looks like ceisis  is exactly the same however.

Though to be sure I find myself very pleasantly situated here, with every prospect of getting acquainted, and moreover pleasantly so. You cannot imagine how a good a school I have got. I have been here just a week now. I wrote to you, if I remember right, just before I left old Bowdoin perhaps that will answer for an account of Commencement  etc. I was about sick awhile, but got better. I came up here Friday, Sept. 5th. I expected to be obliged to hire a carriage & horse to get here, but 'Life' or Eliphalet, Son of the celebrated 'Parson Greely' was down there, and most joyfully brought me up, finding that I was 'the Master! He carried me right to 'Old Parson Greely's, where I staid Saturday, and Lissy, is a fine girl too. Parson Greely is a rather eccentric old man, has been the minister of the 'Old Parish', in Turner, for 30 or 40 years. The Proprietors of Turner gave land forming certain funds amounting to $350, 00 per annum for Ministerial, and $200.00 for a school fund. There is no telling the advantage of such a fund to a town. It is a fact, the possession of priveliges enables to appreciate them, to appreciate, to deserve them. This fund supports two schools for three months every fall, high schools, none under 12 ever permitted. Teacher has the right of casting out the youngest to leave only 50, if he choose. I have 60 to 70, almost all between 15 or 14 & 21.

I have one class in Latin, 3 in French, one of them really knowing about as much & having read more than I have, though my College Education is complete on that head, and I studied quite thoroughly. Class 12 or 15 Smyths Algebra,  many of them having already studied it thoroughly, more so than I have, though to be sure I have gone rather further in Math. Classes in Colburns & Baileys Classes of 12 to 20 or more reviewing Smyths & the celebrated Welch's Arithmetic; As good classes in Philosophy & Chemistry, Astronomy & as ever at Foxcroft Academy. Classes in Abercrombie & Upham, thorough ones too, Worcester History, Parkers Exercises etc. Splendid Grammar class,  30 or 40 good grammarians etc. It is a splendid school. you never saw so good so well disposed, or so handsome a school at Foxcroft, for the number. I board 1\/2 mile from the school house. 7 of my scholars, coming from distant parts of the town you know, board at Deacon Dressers, where I do more or less at every house in the neighborhood. Worse yet, all like the Master! School is very full. Teacher has right to turn out all over 50 not usually exercised I cant, good scholar, come to learn, behave & study. too great pleasure to have such scholar to drive 'em off. I hear 2 or 3 classes out of school hours, though not expected 6 hours, only 20,  per month.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103053,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103053","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/21ff870e3752458b6208020a05414c37.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/21ff870e3752458b6208020a05414c37.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/21ff870e3752458b6208020a05414c37.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/21ff870e3752458b6208020a05414c37.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:10:11+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:05+00:00","filename":"21ff870e3752458b6208020a05414c37.jpg","authentication":"59f55dd0c27988aaed3b8786d556b665","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_191_010_003_o2.jpg","size":1827697,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2933,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057699012514047999522492915502880350686609745025634765625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031852"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031852"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031852"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"21ff870e3752458b6208020a05414c37.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812071,"FileSize":1827697,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2933\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2933,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:39:02","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:18:52","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:18:52","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3145,"ExifImageLength":3860,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1283,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1283","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I happened to be very lucky in my situation here. Most of the town are Universalists, all the most influential part nearly. But I am placed first in the Old Parish where all the Congregationalists are found most. Most people here have been opposed to every thing religious in schools the Universalists oppose even the reading Scriptures in schools; it has not been practiced in any form, for some years. I hardly knew what to do about it. I ave been told since by professors of religion that they should at first have advised me to omit it. However, I finally concluded and the second day , (only organized the first) I prefaced a few remarks and opened the school with reading a chapter and prayer. By good providence I happened first to take well; perhaps because I looked like Seavey the whole 'pile of gals' happened to like me. Some, of course, were better pleased: none hardly much worse: and the school seems much liked by all indiscriminately, as far as I hear, and people tell me so.\n\nThe Universalist Minister, Mr. Bates, he is one of their 'big guns' in the whole state, and I expect a very fine man, lives next house to school house. His daughters , two noble great girls, and really splendid scholars too, go to school and are much interested. Mr. Bates appears interested in the school. Much pleased with my introduction of some new books, Burritts Astronomy etc.  So far I hear none but favorable reports of the school. I think my course in reading the scriptures has a favorable effect, and will have. People here think so, though they thought it a dangerous experiment at first.\n Wed. 17th.

It is an opinion I have heard that if the smallest particle of matter were annihilated, it would destroy the infinity & Equilibrium of the Universe; but the idea does not seem reasonable to me. I do not so understand infinity. To be sure I cant conceive really of the effect it would have to cut off a large or small piece from the end of an Asymptote; when it has no end!  The very definition of an infinite quantity shows you dont know how much it is, of course if you take away any known quantity whatever, you dont know how much remains, if you did you would know the first quantity! What reasoning is that?\nFinally I believe I shall conclude to believe in the infinity of infinity.

The fact is, as I wrote to you last summer, you do not take exercise enough in the open air; You must try to do better in that respect I think: I know how it is exactly, you dont feel like it, and the less exercise you take, the less you feel inclined to take.\nBut let me advise you to make an effort to take some vigorous exercise, in the open air, even if you don't like it. It is really necessary for your health, more necessary for you, than it is for many others around you, those city chaps perhaps who have been brought up in indolence, or a large proportion of Country chaps, lazy fellows, sent into the store, cause they would not work etc. You now have long been habituated to labor. constant & vigorous labor, which habit, besides its naturalness, requires it.\n\nSuch changes of habits, of whole constitutions or systems of existence are not to be made with impunity.\n\n I will send you that money, if I can get the Bill changed, as I have it now by me, and can get along very comfortably, I think, till Spring. What I shall do for money, next June & August, I yet know not.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103060,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103060","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/fb76b692afa53e92c6ecd82457e367ce.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/fb76b692afa53e92c6ecd82457e367ce.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/fb76b692afa53e92c6ecd82457e367ce.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fb76b692afa53e92c6ecd82457e367ce.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:10:20+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:05+00:00","filename":"fb76b692afa53e92c6ecd82457e367ce.jpg","authentication":"ab0d6f2136cd6b21c959e947a04d8ef0","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_191_012_002_o2.jpg","size":1787171,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2913,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.056807001818159001682584374748330446891486644744873046875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031953"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031953"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["031953"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"fb76b692afa53e92c6ecd82457e367ce.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812071,"FileSize":1787171,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2913\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2913,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:39:20","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:19:53","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:19:53","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3100,"ExifImageLength":3830,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1283,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1283","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The building a new Schoolhouse in Bangor, seems to me of very doubtful expediency.

Richmond Corner is the P.O. direction next Monday, and I suppose I can continue there as long as I chose, at $18.00 per month. that is three or four months, but I do not mean to stay much more than two, for, after being out the fall term, I think I must be here again at the Commencement of the Spring term, especially on account of the Lectures, and, as it is partly a Subscription School, I can leave about when I choose, not having pledged myself to stay.\n\nTerm here is one Week longer; Vacation 8 weeks, So I can stay 9 weeks, in 10 at a pinch.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103064,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103064","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ab424f358cd1089f4fb9e153eef9fdbe.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ab424f358cd1089f4fb9e153eef9fdbe.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ab424f358cd1089f4fb9e153eef9fdbe.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ab424f358cd1089f4fb9e153eef9fdbe.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:10:26+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:05+00:00","filename":"ab424f358cd1089f4fb9e153eef9fdbe.jpg","authentication":"43d54cb4ecbd19068d18f75370588b29","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_191_013_002_o2.jpg","size":1832557,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2977,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05699738115676999949954506519134156405925750732421875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["032027"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["032027"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["032027"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ab424f358cd1089f4fb9e153eef9fdbe.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812071,"FileSize":1832557,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2977\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2977,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:39:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:20:27","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:20:27","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3197,"ExifImageLength":3866,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1283,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1283","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I believe I have written to Sister Anne since my school closed, and perhaps probably you have seen that, so I need not wrote too you any thing of that, as news.

I hoped to have avoided it, but was unable, and it got too late to engage another.\n\nAs I had to wait, and could do nothing to much advantage, if I came to College, the Turner people kindly invited me to spend the time there, which was quite convenient, and saved me considerable expense here.   I came here with about $60.00 in my pocket, at least I received that a few days before. I have paid $2.75 for a pair boots, Postage Bills at Turner & Summer term at Bowdoin, about $2.37 1\/2  Stationary etc. $2.75.  Then Expenses coming down .50 I owe Stanwood here, cloth for my coat & things five or six dollars. Wash woman bill -- $1.50, I guess, or more. The my watch, $19.00. Stage fare to be paid to Richmond perhaps $1.50 -- etc.etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.\n\nSo I have considerable of an idea that I shall not pay this fall a great deal to Old McKeen the College Treasurer of the $50.00 or 60.00 standing against me on my term bills. \nHowever some $25.00 of that I never mean to pay, being that on my first bill, charged for Advance Standing Tuition etc. for the Freshman year.

In counsel is safety & Wisdom.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103074,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103074","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/bb96efefc251872a028e55285353cafb.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/bb96efefc251872a028e55285353cafb.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/bb96efefc251872a028e55285353cafb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/bb96efefc251872a028e55285353cafb.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:10:41+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:05+00:00","filename":"bb96efefc251872a028e55285353cafb.jpg","authentication":"4c45e6523c7981241f3e3826607ee3a2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_192_001_004_o2.jpg","size":1683005,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2828,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0551038883650269983860425782040692865848541259765625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["032155"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["032155"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["032155"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"bb96efefc251872a028e55285353cafb.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812072,"FileSize":1683005,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2828\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2828,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:39:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:21:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:21:55","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":91,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3085,"ExifImageLength":3926,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1283,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1283","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"As regards Charles & Almeda there is certainly danger, almost danger of a real quarrel.

Coll. June 25th, 1847\n\nBrother Joseph\n\n   I received a letter from you June 13 containing Money, $35.00. I forget whether I have yet acknowledged its reception. I believe not; suppose I ought to have done it before now however.\nYour last letter I received about one week since: and it probably deserves some what of answering.  Some if it had become rather Old for these times, Some things though ever improve by age.\n As for \"Jeremy Bentham\", I believe you advise me to read more before I judge of him. I do not think I am very likely to read him much. There is a deal of truth in the Old Minister's remark that \"it is wrong to tread a good book;  --there are so many better ones.\" If I should undertake to read very book which is really twice as truly valuable as Bentham, I should have the work of more than one lifetime laid out. I guess that Bentham's warmest admirers do not think of denying his infidelity or Atheism. As to reading for ones self so as to judge, it is very plain that it will not do in all calls. Testimony is as valuable in the literary as in the physical world I am no more obliged to read \"Paul de Kock\" and \"Eugene Sue\" in order to determine they are not worth reading, than I am obliged to cross the Atlantic to determine the existence of such as city as Paris.  One must have opinions upon books he has never read, as well as upon things he has never seen.

I deny that the language is dubious -- in the original -- or even in this version of it, which could not be improved.\n3.

I intended to leave this Afternoon for Portland, but lost my passage, and stay till tomorrow morn; expect to go to Bath, take Huntress to Portland, and by Rail Road can go clear through to Boston for $1.50 from Bath, or stop any where I choose. How long I shall be gone, or where I shall go, I am sure I know not. Perhaps as long or as far as my money some $10,00 or 12.00 will carry me.\n\n I have got somewhat tired out with my weeks work, I assure you.

In the Shoe Making room, a good looking young fellow rose from his Seat and came out to speak to me, caused quite a, almost fuss among keepers overseers & Wardens, as no prisoner is allowed to rise or speak. It was a young fellow committed from Bangor, by name of Henry Porter, true name A.C. Smith of Augusta. I do not know whether he had ever seen me, I did not know him. It was probably a sudden attack of insanity although the Wardens said he had never before manifested it, and his behavior had been unexceptional. They soon quieted him, and 'I came away then'.\nStopped 2 or 3  hours in Waldoboro', a thrifty new town of Much Shipbuilding. 10 Vessels lay on the stocks all together, 18 building in the town.\nStopped Friday night in Wiscasset, a very old, & very fine looking town.

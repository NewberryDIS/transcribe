Oregon is generally supposed to be a part of the Indian country named in the act of Congress of June 30, 1834 but Such is not the case.  Great Britian and the United States made a treaty in 1818, by which the Northern boundary of the former was extended west on the 49th parallel of North latitude to the Stony Mountains, and the Territory beyond these was described as country to be held in the joint occupation of the two powers.  The Rocky Mountains then was the Western Boundary of the United States for legislative purposes and so continued until 1840.  The act of 1834, shows in terms that it was intended for a country over which the general Government had absolute and exclusive jurisdiction, Congress by express enactments in 1850, extended said act to this Territory for the reason as must be supposed that it was not in force here before that time.  The act of 1834 then, has no vitality here because Oregon is Indian Country, but by virtue of the act of 1850, which gives it effect here so far as its provisions may be applicable, is that provision prohibiting the sale of liquor to the Indian applicable very much of the act of 1834, is [strike] is clearly unsuited to the present condition of the country, all those provisions which tend to prevent emigration, the free

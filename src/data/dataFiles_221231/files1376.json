is a queer place: an island about seven miles long and only about one and a half miles wide, has a population of 1750--210 of whom ar white, the other 1540 are black and colored--the latter are of all shades from a blue-eyed octaroon to a dark mulatto. One African slave who has withered down to about 3 1\/2 feet; she is the last of her kind. \nAll the people are interested in making salt. Later years have been bad ones, and we are beset with beggars all the time. Poor Creatures it is a mystery how they get anything to eat: Very little grows on the island aside from Cocoa-nuts--there are a few hundred of these. \nWe live on the western edge of the island, about 150 feet from the water, which leads on the shore night and ay, while the wind soughs through the long Cocoa fronds and needles of the Casurinas in our front yard. Since beginning this letter my wife and I trudged across the island to the eastern side on which there is a hill about 70 feet high--all the rest of the island is from 8 to 15 feet above the sea. At the top of the hill we stood with the wind blowing in our faces directly from Sahara, 2500 miles to the easward. \nGrand Turk, our island is about 1170 miles south of New York, and 90 miles north of San Domingo. There is a perpetual revolution going on in San Domingo all the time, and we always have more or less men and Generals here as Refugees. The misfortune is that no principle is involved in the struggle--it is simply which party shall handle the money, in either case the people will suffer. \nI hope you will continue writing. You appeal to the human, and reach the heart. \nI see that Mr. Alden had a dinner a short time ago. W.D. will be 70 the first of March, so I expect something will be done for him. \nWith Kindest regards in which Mrs H joins me, I am \nSincerely J Howells\nEdith Wyatt\nChicago,

It was a dismal March afternoon with a warm soggy snow falling, so mixed with rain you could not tell which it was. As we stopped to look in a book-store windows, he said: \"Have you ever read \"Every One his Own Way\"? I said \"No.\" O, my! he replied we must have it, and we went into the store and he bought a copy, which is now before me, on the dedication page, I afterwards wrote: \"Presented to JAH. by MWH. on their trip down the Ohio on the steamboat Virginia, March 8, 1902. Pittsburgh.\" \nAfter supper, when too dark to see any more of the process of loading the boat, we took our places at one of the tables in the well lighted, comfortable cabin and he read to me--first

acquainted with a book that has been a delight to me a hundred times since, for I usually keep it on a stand near the head of my bed, and if wakeful, I read one or more of the sketches and then go to sleep. I find that you have hit the same vein that makes Burns loved by the whole world--home scenes and home people are depicted so we fail not to recognize them. \nI rather like the conceit of Major Porter, and his party--it possessed the virtue of differing from my home village where there are ten girls to each young man. Then too what a good time \"Tim\" had at the Exposition with Uncle Bill's boys and the Peruvians, both male and female. That scene where the candy maker \"dreamily whipping\" a rope of candy which would not have been a bit too big for one boy. I was always fascinated by a candy maker at our county fair, and I have often stood on Euclid avenue, Cleveland, opposite the Soldiers Monument, watching a candy puller. He is gone now and so has the little two story shop and a sky scraper has taken its place. In the retail past there was a pretty Annie, who did up candy and served ice cream to the young men and old ones too, for I will be 74 on \"Sat. Sept.\" 1, 1906.--and to the Mrs. LaGranges. \nI go back to the \"Chatterbox\" as my first love, and always get relief from care a pleasure in it. I have for a long time wanted to thank you for giving the world the sketches you have, and I heartily do so now\nSincerely yours JHowells\nMiss?

In spite of growing up in Wisconsin, and passing many Christmases in cold climates, I never have spent the holidays in the country which has such beauty at that season. Not quite \"never\", for I did have one Xmas in a unclear sort of hotel-boardinghouse in Minnesota, where I spent many months for my health, and loved to walk in the woods on sunny days when the mercury was close to zero, above or below, in air like wine.

Though I am still using a pencil and writing in bed it is not because of illness, but just to be accepting old age, and foolish legs that don't march to soldierly rhythms. Half a day in, and out, of bed isn't a hardship, and I go out in my car three afternoons a week with my grandmother-chaffeuse, young at fifty, and other days, 'free days' I call them, I walk about the neighborhood, or down grade a mile, to return by the bus.

She confessed & offered to return all she had taken. The officer, a gentle and patient man, I much respected, assured me I needn't fear her stealing again, and I kept her six months or more. I didn't want to blacken her future, and we parted amicably, but I couldn't give her a written recommendation. She was a good cook, and quite worker. She had a son to support.

It is something of a picture to delight heroic spirits to see the new Poetry Anthology and The Poetry Magazine coming forth from two ladies with pillows behind their heads in Convalescent sanctuaries, miles and miles from each other and the offices.  And to think I had the nerve to write unclear word letters to them both today, and talk to them like they were well.\nLet us pretend that neither you nor I are in the new Anthology and thus offer the following impartial observations: I think it is going to be a milestone. I think it will be looked back to for ten years - at a conservative estimate - for it is a concentration of the challenge both real and alleged - that Harriet and Alice have issued these four years.\nThe Philadelphia circle of poets seemed quite determined to have me this year April 15 - but March 31 was my limit. They still swear - in the person of one Otto T. Mallery - to have me next February - and I have told him to do what he could toward rousing Bryn Mawr on the side. Our friend Katherine Dudley has undertaken to do the same - and I will be glad if you put in your word. My good crowds are nearly always the friends of my friends - when I really enjoy them - and so much more comfortable to meet.\nSpring has come - and I could write on and on. But I spare you.

Arelia has staid at home all day to write letters but I have been to church once and have just returned from a short lecture on all kind of reform.    Tuesday evening.    \n   I will once more try to write a few lines company came in or I should have finished it Sunday.  My dear baby was quite unwell last night and kept me awake most all night so that I have been almost sick myself to day.  It is very seldom my babe is sick, but when she is I am very uneasy for Josia you well remember my darling boy I lost in Marietta.  I think we make more if possible of this child than we did of that.  Areli has become very much attached to the baby and says she cannot leave her unless we get her likeness taken, for her to take home with her.  You must excuse me for writing so much about my baby.

There is one form Gafton here which came from Ghetford.  I like Mr. Shores much I have had two or three good talks with him.  The female teacher is from Maine & is a fine teacher I think.  She has our class in Geometry. There is a first a rate class of us in it, we commenced at the fourth book & Mr. Shores class we shall go through, he says his class commenced there that winter & went through. there are six of us in the first class.  Miss J. Dunton ... O Dunton... H Clarck & Mr. Hudson, Dexter & myself.  I have to study all the time as I have so many studies but I am good for them.  I was sorry to learn that Lydia's health has failed her, but hope she will regain it again. suppose she has erd this closed her school.  I expected to hear that Edwin was at C Woodstock.  (Hope he will get better soon.  Wish Lydia & Sarah & Edwin & Myron would write me & not wait for me to write them first as I have so many studies it occupies nearly all my time","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40325,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/40325","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3883e91566879aef320a908196f35e36.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3883e91566879aef320a908196f35e36.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3883e91566879aef320a908196f35e36.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3883e91566879aef320a908196f35e36.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T16:28:57+00:00","modified":"2020-01-21T18:05:47+00:00","filename":"3883e91566879aef320a908196f35e36.jpg","authentication":"b42fea8f635033ea7d2cb3fef88c8c49","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_025_001_03_o2.jpg","size":1374197,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2783,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0457206119162640034492284257794381119310855865478515625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["235934"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["235934"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["235934"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3883e91566879aef320a908196f35e36.jpg","FileDateTime":1509380799,"FileSize":1374197,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2783\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2783,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:20 09:37:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025000000000000001387778780781445675529539585113525390625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:18 23:59:34","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:18 23:59:34","ShutterSpeedValue":5.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":69,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3286,"ExifImageLength":4250,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":173,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/173","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"but will write home to some of you, as often as once a week.\n\n  Please remember me to brothers & sisters.\n\nFrom your brother\nDavid W.

You just pay my expenses for a year or two and then I can not make any more than I can at my tract if I care as much.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40358,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/40358","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3cd3de4b9efbf9dc1f3237e75d0f0370.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3cd3de4b9efbf9dc1f3237e75d0f0370.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3cd3de4b9efbf9dc1f3237e75d0f0370.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3cd3de4b9efbf9dc1f3237e75d0f0370.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T16:30:33+00:00","modified":"2020-01-21T18:05:47+00:00","filename":"3cd3de4b9efbf9dc1f3237e75d0f0370.jpg","authentication":"1efcad1d7035306456d99e750863497d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_025_010_02_o2.jpg","size":1349701,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2258,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05534646360266400055838431626398232765495777130126953125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170719"],"TimeCreated":["000511"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170719"],"TimeCreated":["000511"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170719"],"TimeCreated":["000511"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3cd3de4b9efbf9dc1f3237e75d0f0370.jpg","FileDateTime":1509380800,"FileSize":1349701,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2258\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2258,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:20 09:39:06","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025000000000000001387778780781445675529539585113525390625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:19 00:05:11","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:19 00:05:11","ShutterSpeedValue":5.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3428,"ExifImageLength":5463,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":173,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/173","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"since I come here I have only barely paid my way as I can how you by letting you what my expenses are weekly.

I was also, but think it best for her to stay where she is, must say I do not feel pleased with her religious society she attends; you will think I am wrong. I feel I have done wrong I have not talked with them my family more than I have may I be enabled to do my duty more faithfull.\nfrom your Affectionate mother\nJane Kendall\n\nNathan Kendall\nNB Your

So glad to get it as was afraid you were snow bound, or something. Armistice Day and Sunday hindered mail delivery. Have just ans'd this from Frank, and told him I'm not able to board anyone.  That I thought he had decided against Fla. and have had 5 answers from the ad. you put in the paper, and that I expect renters about Christmas time. The express on bushel of fruit is $2.13 up to Nov 15. Suppose it goes up after that date. A letter from June Johnson Smith same mail as yours. Wrote her the apt. still available and asked 2 months rent to hold the place. Also wrote the deal has not yet been completed, so she still has a chance. Told her the older boy could sleep on army cot in garage if she finds it too crowded in apt. told her Garage has laundry tubs with hot water available but not constant. Also good laundromat in town she asked about that. Saw and heard the Great Caruso twice last week Had Lena clean living and dining r. yesterday. Knee still sensitive but not bothering. Old Mr. Riffle had light heart attack last Thurs. or Friday. Been busy at many things. Interested in great news from the M.C.'s Hope to hear all about the celebration last Sunday. Love to Lucille and Nancy on their birthdays. Going to town now, nearly 5 p.m. for bread and to mail letters. Must reprove your for sending the $10.00.

I go Monticello. Hope to get letter from you there.\n\n  Am glad the flat is rented. Who are \"the Browns\"? The people I thought we were going to get were the Kibles - or some such name - recommended by Miss Wheelock. Glad to have anybody tho who will pay the rent promptly. \n  Please look in my account book and find tax statement for 1913 and enclose it in your next. I will mail the money.\n  What do you hear from Mrs. Monahan? Also have you heard anything from John L. Meyers, decorator who was to paint the kitchen? If not, write him again. Call up the Coles - they live on Colorado Ave The address is on that piece of paper that had all those names taken on the telephone - his office phone is Central 306. Tribune Bldg. )Frank M. Cole with \"The Robert S. Denham Co\") and find out if Meyers had done anything. Also ask him to with hold payments to Mrs. Monahan on the things they were going to buy from her until she pays me the rent. \n  Ask the landlord Browns to clean up the bedroom the L. had so we can get it furnished. Also to paint borders on dining room floor and finish painting the hall. This ought to be done before the phone is moved.\n  Have the phone put near the library table in dining room. East side of big window - I think has more space. Write out directions and leave for phone man.\n  You were very business like in your dealings with Wanzer. Hope they did as you asked. Am sure you will get lots of experience attending to things while I am away. Only don't work too hard. Get a nice suit, hat and gloves.\n  You didn't mention Grandpa except when telling what cash you have on hand. Was it a good visit?\n   How did you come out on the typewriting test?

I hope to get it before summer time.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118141,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118141","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/60570c6c994b575660477f62ff925214.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/60570c6c994b575660477f62ff925214.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/60570c6c994b575660477f62ff925214.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/60570c6c994b575660477f62ff925214.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:16:41+00:00","modified":"2021-04-05T02:50:36+00:00","filename":"60570c6c994b575660477f62ff925214.jpg","authentication":"f7e41d2239ed7d455e6be25e019d7995","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_131_006_003_o2.jpg","size":1010571,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2306,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040577358581478269183850926538070780225098133087158203125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["223537-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["223537-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["223537-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"60570c6c994b575660477f62ff925214.jpg","FileDateTime":1612458907,"FileSize":1010571,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2306\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2306,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"9mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:20:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01111111111111111153515462746099728974513709545135498046875,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 22:35:37","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 22:35:37","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.49185299999999987363707987242378294467926025390625,"ApertureValue":4.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2283,"ExifImageLength":3564,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1381,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1381","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"3\nIt was snowing for awhile this morning and raining since and mud everywhere.\n\n  This \"hotel\" is a scream!\n  passed it while hunting it this morning without even suspecting it was a hotel.

If so, please have the address changed to this place, as it looks now as though I would be here long enough to pay for having it done. Your letter of the f24rd came my way Saturday morning. I do love to get your letters Tafern! I read them over and over and they are such a joy and comfort to me. I am glad you were so nicely remembered Christmas, and with such sensible things. So glad Max gave you a substitute for the baby chain, as I did not like to see your heavy locket on the fragile little thing. When you see it on the neck of one of your offspring you will see how much more appropriate it is there. I wish I could see your new dress - won't you wear it down here? Grandmother has been sick all the week. She isn't real well yet, but is better than the first three days. After dinner she laid down for a nap, and is just dressing now. I wrote two letters this morning to John Richards, and Beulah Huston. Then I went out and trimmed a tree. It is very fascinating work and I like to do it. Only I scratch my hands and arms all up on the thorns and sharp twigs. We had a very pleasant, quiet Christmas Dinner at Mrs. Richardson's - one of our neighbors. She has a boathouse and wash-house combined. They let a pail down in the lake and dip up water for the washing. We would have gone out rowing, only there was a strong North wind that made white caps on the tiny lake (it is about 50 acres) and we didn't care to risk it. For dinner we had smothered chicken, baked Irish, and boiled several potatoes, rolls, guava jelly, salmon in little pie crusts (don't know what you call it), fruit cake (awful good), pumpkin pie, nuts, raisins, and candy - wintergreen & peppermint. \nTafern, please see if you can find some aluminum hair pins for G.M. These will be for her birthday present - and some Euthymol and Burt's Head Wash for me. Keep track of what I owe you. Much warmer today - 72 degrees at 4 p.m. Much love to you both, Mother.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118168,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118168","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b2e2dc40d6640c9f0a7fb9ca0c2a4732.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b2e2dc40d6640c9f0a7fb9ca0c2a4732.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b2e2dc40d6640c9f0a7fb9ca0c2a4732.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b2e2dc40d6640c9f0a7fb9ca0c2a4732.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:17:10+00:00","modified":"2021-04-06T02:01:03+00:00","filename":"b2e2dc40d6640c9f0a7fb9ca0c2a4732.jpg","authentication":"ef128709074b22d5f7036b37da227795","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_131_014_002_o2.jpg","size":1558657,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2796,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05161662825200021009752759937327937223017215728759765625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["223930-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["223930-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["223930-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b2e2dc40d6640c9f0a7fb9ca0c2a4732.jpg","FileDateTime":1612458908,"FileSize":1558657,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2796\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2796,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:21:17","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01111111111111111153515462746099728974513709545135498046875,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 22:39:30","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 22:39:30","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.49185299999999987363707987242378294467926025390625,"ApertureValue":4.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3851,"ExifImageLength":4958,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1381,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1381","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Tell me what the club girls give you, and what they think of your calendar photos.

Had a card from Beulah - the first time in years that she has not sent me a present. I am glad she didn't, for I always felt so foolish to get such nice ones from her, and never return any. Had a long letter from Mrs. Marshall with news of the usual people. She asks for your address. Hers is 3751 W. 22nd St. I am interested in Ralph, the Minn. boy. Tell me how he gets on. Tell Max he had better carry the alligator letter opener in his out pocket so nobody will theif it. He needn't write especially about that. I thought he would be pleased with it. I have read a little in my new book - part of the preface to \"The Doctors Dilemma\" and am crazy to read more. But I have so little time to read. There are a thousand things to do all the time. There are so many things about this place that remind me of Highlands. The town is a little larger but when you go to the p.o. you have the same feeling of being the center of attraction, and you are expected to speak to everybody. It is as quiet, except when a train comes in, and getting letters is the only exciting thing that happens. When you go calling you are expected to stay three for four hours, and talk of inconsequential nothings in the way of neighborhood gossip, the neighbors chickens, and somebody's cow going to be fresh, etc. etc. And when anybody comes within a mile of the house you know they're coming here. It is splendid having all the soft water we want from our own well, and having the pump on the porch, and everything nicely screened in. You can sleep out on the porch if you want to when you come down, as it is plenty large enough. Tafren, did you ever get your magazines that you subscribed for? None has ever come here - not that I want any, but I happend to think that you said you had subscribed. Mr. Whitnall shot a rabbit the day before Christmas, and Mrs. W. brought it over. We stewed it and ate part of it for supper. Had the rest Friday noon. It was very good, tasted much like chicken breast. I wrote to Pattie the other day and sent it to her address in Los Angeles. Don't know whether it will reach her or not. The graphaphone seems to be all right again. G.M. plays it quite often. So, the funny old gentleman hasn't been here for a week & a half.

The grove should be fertilized within the next two weeks - which means that I must have the January rent from Mr. Cole. Has he returned from N.Y.? or has he committed suicide? I earned a dollar and a quarter yesterday - the first since the laundry money. One of the ladies who came to G.M.'s birthday party was a Mrs. Fairbanks from Fitchburg, Mass. she was loud in her praise of the cake I made. So the other day Mr. Fairbanks - a nice old gentleman 75 years old Dec. 12th, came over to say he had heard so much about Mother's birthday cake, that he wanted one for his birthday. That he would have had it before if he had known I baked cakes, and asked how much it would be. I told him I never baked a cake and sold it so I didn't know. But I figured the cost of materials to be 60 cents, my work and fuel to be the balance. He paid it cheerfully and is, I hope, enjoying the cake.\n\nI was asked the other day if I would go to Sebring to take a case where the baby was two weeks old. I agreed and I was to be notified in a day or two. No notice has come, so probably the help they got temporarily stayed. \n\nthe H.P. vaudeville performance? Am glad you enjoy Stella.

KENNEDY DUNCAN MCDONALD]]\n\n[[In pencil in upper right margin -- [1915]]] \n\ncrossed-out -- Chicago, Tampa, Friday 4 p.m. \nDarling Tafern, - Well, I've had the gayest, happiest time the past week of any since I left N.Y. Have been on the go most of the time. Once to John's Pass Mitchells Beach for bathing and \"shelling,\" once to Tampa Bay for same, then up the Manatee River - a lovely little trip! - over to Passe a Grille bathing and shelling, and finally the trip back to Tampa this morning where I persuaded Mr. and Mrs. Elliott to accompany me. We went car riding all over the place then had dinner at the \"Dairy Kitchen,\" then over to the depot to find the train had changed time and I was left by 10 minutes! So nothing to do but to stay all night. I found a cheap hotel, kept by an elderly couple and got a room for 50 cents for the night. Then we all went down to the boat and played 3 hand euchre until time for the boat to leave. I got off and waved at them until I couldn't see them any longer.

We were on the Tampa Bay side and had to car ride to Gulf Port where we got into a small launch and rode the first trip to John's Pass. We went in bathing before dinner. Hung our clothes up to dry on the clothes line in the sun provided for that purpose, ate our lunch took down the clothes and went back to the boat landing. While waiting a boy told us there were lots of Kokan'as coquenas in the sand on the beach so we went to dig some. They are little creatures something between an oyster and a crab that live in pretty little shells less than an inch long. The shells are tinted pink, green, red, tan, gray, blue, etc. People gather them and make a broth of them, and at Passe a Grille we saw a woman with a child's shovel digging in the sand at the edge of the water. She threw the sand into a sieve, pushed the sieve into the water and let the waves wash off the sand. She said she was getting them for dinner. I asked how she fixed them, She pours boiling water over the coquenas, stews them 20 minutes, strains them, adds pepper and salt and eats the broth with a sandwich. She told me that she and a friend had a booth on the beach all winter, and made broth and sold it and sandwiches to tourists. When we came back I took a picture of The Jungle, which is a swampy looking place covered with palms, vines, etc. etc. so think one couldn't get through. The flowers here are glorious now - Bogenvilla, purple vines, cover houses and barns and porches. The oleanders are blooming, also magnolias, roses, phlox, and many flowers I don't know.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118178,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118178","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/38d1faaf43323f43b04a53059eff6dc2.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/38d1faaf43323f43b04a53059eff6dc2.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/38d1faaf43323f43b04a53059eff6dc2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/38d1faaf43323f43b04a53059eff6dc2.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:17:22+00:00","modified":"2021-04-19T03:32:09+00:00","filename":"38d1faaf43323f43b04a53059eff6dc2.jpg","authentication":"455b5d1881b5fe1e856e79e8a30b09c6","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_132_005_003_o2.jpg","size":1574654,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2850,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05115834957764782420230886827994254417717456817626953125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["224117-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["224117-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["224117-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"38d1faaf43323f43b04a53059eff6dc2.jpg","FileDateTime":1612458908,"FileSize":1574654,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2850\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2850,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"16mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:21:40","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01111111111111111153515462746099728974513709545135498046875,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 22:41:17","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 22:41:17","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.49185299999999987363707987242378294467926025390625,"ApertureValue":4.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"SubSecTimeOriginal":44,"SubSecTimeDigitized":44,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3952,"ExifImageLength":4992,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1381,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1381","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"[[Letterhead: -- THE NEXT STEP ONE YEAR - - - 10c INSIDE CHICAGO - -15c TELEPHONE STATE HEADQUARTERS The Socialist Party of Illinois 803 W.

Also sores of any kind heal so slowly here so I took extra care.  But I wrote lots of letters and read a good deal and worked at my pine needles.  The rafia you sent is just what I wanted.

He is the one you refused to let help you up the steps, saying  \"I don't want the king doctor to help me up the steps.  I want to get up self!\"  You will find exact quotation in your diary.  This may not be quite right.\n I hope you will get along all right with the wool slippers tho I think you have started wrong.   They are knit all in one piece and you begin at the sole.  It takes 160 stitches for a slipper the size of mine.   I think if you allow 9 or ten stitches for an inch it will be about right.   You knit two plain and purl two all the way for about an inch, then you begin to narrow.  To do this you *knit two together, purl, slip one, knit one, bind* then knit plain 2 purl 2 all the way round as before until you come to that place again.   It is a good plan to mark it with a colored thread so you will not mistake your purled stitch which will be the center of the toe and goes clear to the top of the slipper.  Do you remember how to bind?  You slip off a stitch without knitting it, then knit one, then throw the slipped stitch over the knit one.  If you find you are narrowing too fast, narrow every other time around, but G.M. says they fit better to narrow off every time at first.\n  There is a case of diptheria in town, pronounced so by wire from The Tampa Board of Health where the specimen was sent for culture.  Thus, in a way, I am vindicated.

So I don't know what the devil they have got.  Am inclined to think something lacking in the B. of H.\n Last night, being Halloween celebration, we went first to the movies which had a 5 reel (20 cents) show of Napoleon giving the principal events in his life.

Mrs. Street's oldest son - about 20 - told the story and he has a very monotonous delivery.  Then I hate pictures of soldiers and fighting so that I was disgusted all the way through.  From the movie show we went to the skating rink where a masquerade skate was going on.  Most of the costumes were ridiculous, only one - Columbia - was pretty.  But we laughed and looked on for about half an hour, then came home at ten.  One person I wish you could have seen, \"Old Dan Tucker,\" we call him as his name is Tucker.  He is tall and very thin, carried a little dandy cane and was unmasked.  He had on on a solemn suit of black, cut Prince Albert, and he skated in solemn ecstacy around and around never stopping once as long as we watched, and all alone.  He certainly thought he was IT.  He usually has a bid cud of tobacco in his mouth with evaporated remnants of some clinging to his bushy mustache, so you can imagine how genuinely attractive he must look.  He is the town clerk and a Mason and with the dignity of those offices he adds a roguish, sporty air which makes a comical combination.  \n\n  The town kids had lots of fun running around the street masked, and one boy about 9 was frightening a lot of little 6 year old girls dressed in white.

KENNEDY   DUNCAN MCDONALD]\nRockford, Sunday morning.\nDear Children,\nI am sitting out on the front porch at Mr. Hudler's where I can see lots of trees and blue sky and hear the squirrels bark and see them scamper around.   There are lots of Italians in this neighborhood, so the air is somewhat tainted with the smell of garlic or onions or both and they go by chattering like monkeys.  today is a big day for them and there is an Eyetalian band here from Chicago.\n\n  I have canvassed diligently, but find few socialists.  All of the women will vote against the saloons, this, with the exception of a half dozen or so that I have talked with.   I have sold about 85 cents worth of literature thus far - one 25 cent book and the rest, my pamphlets, 2 for 5 cents.  so you  may know how rich I am going to be.

The poor girl had to burn damp rags and make a smudge at night in order to be able to sleep at all, and she would get up mornings as tired as when she went to bed, and be all bitten up in the bargain. She wanted me to economize in every possible way, and not put so much in the dishes, etc. etc. etc. But the final act was this: when we started in, she had a lot of groceries that she bought in Dec. 1916 at Montgomery Wards that she said would save us much because the prices were lower. She continually patted herself on the back for her foresight and sagacity in getting them. Last week she called me in saying she had something to say to me that I mightn't like. She expects her daughter and a friend to spend the winter, so she wants to hoard up the vegetables to use then. As I owned half of them by reason of our partnership, I contended that she should continue to let me use them and benefit by the low prices (in which she would share, of course).

The first fruit is as large as tennis balls.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":118214,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/118214","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/18b432bde83599fce3515f9b66253609.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/18b432bde83599fce3515f9b66253609.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/18b432bde83599fce3515f9b66253609.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/18b432bde83599fce3515f9b66253609.jpg"},"added":"2021-02-04T17:18:08+00:00","modified":"2021-04-12T23:16:06+00:00","filename":"18b432bde83599fce3515f9b66253609.jpg","authentication":"f47b6f891ff24ebfc51262338d7fa9dc","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_walden_m_box_004_fl_133_004_004_o2.jpg","size":1466075,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=5, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS 5DS R, software=Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows), datetime=2021:01:0","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2785,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048742436332202938864543995123312924988567829132080078125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["224627-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["224627-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20201210"],"TimeCreated":["224627-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["991703478805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Walden M Box 4 "]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"18b432bde83599fce3515f9b66253609.jpg","FileDateTime":1612458910,"FileSize":1466075,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2785\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2785,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/4.5"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5DS R","Software":"Adobe Photoshop 22.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2021:01:08 10:23:15","Exif_IFD_Pointer":148},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.01111111111111111153515462746099728974513709545135498046875,"FNumber":4.5,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":320,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":320,"ExifVersion":231,"DateTimeOriginal":"2020:12:10 22:46:27","DateTimeDigitized":"2020:12:10 22:46:27","UndefinedTag:0x9010":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9011":"-05:00","UndefinedTag:0x9012":"-05:00","ShutterSpeedValue":6.49185299999999987363707987242378294467926025390625,"ApertureValue":4.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":24,"SubSecTimeOriginal":22,"SubSecTimeDigitized":22,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3784,"ExifImageLength":4891,"FocalPlaneXResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneYResolution":2413.333343505859375,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":562055000132,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["24\/1","70\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF24-70mm f\/2.8L II USM","UndefinedTag:0xA435":8105003628}}}},"item":{"id":1381,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1381","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Forgot to say we each have had a nap, now ten o'clock ---- Two. o'clock. Went over to Mrs. Lewiston's, a neighbor who is soon going to Chicago. Do you want to have her come out to spend the day with you? She knows Mrs. Woodruff well and will visit her of course while North. She is English, a widow, well educated and a very picturesque talker, tho inclined to gloomy topics at times. She is a good friend of ours, tho and a thoroughly fine woman. I hope you have gone before this to call upon the Thomas' family for I believe you will enjoy them when you get acquainted. The fact that the sister shows such an interest in the baby proves to be that you would like them. What size collar does Max wear? A boarder left a nice new soiled 16 1\/2 Arrow, prevailing style. If Max can wear it, will mail it. Forgot to say that I saw \"The Return of Peter Grimm\" at Mrs. Lewiston's and borrowed the book. Was reading Robt. Stevenson's \"Inland Voyage\" at the hotel. Belongs to Mrs. March. Dearie, - please mail that paper copy of Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde. on shelf in my room, I believe. I had our Song Night advertised at the movie show last night. It's to be next Tuesday evening. Mr. Anderson, a [guide?] from Eagle Lake, one of the chief stockholders in the Pittsburg Development Co., gave me an immense water melon to bring home. We have been having them at the hotel, as fine as ones I ever saw or tasted. Mother said she would have had some of Babin's short dresses done but the machine has been at the hotel, and all she did was by hand, and so hot the needle stuck, etc. So very dry and hot here, gardens all burned up, fruit dropping, etc. Must go over for a swim soon. Hope you got along all right without Max. Is Ralph leaving forever? What did Grandpa Charles Kerr say about his grandchild? Shall be glad to read the American. How splendid that Babins sleeps thru from 9 until 6. Dear, dear, dear, how I should like to see him! Praise the Lord for the steam-roller. Hope the road will soon be finished. How are the Bakers? Does Babins suck his thumb at night? If so, make little bags and fasten them on. Lots of love to each of you, Mother.

There is an interesting article in the Appeal (July 7) (KKM- Appeal to Reason, published in Girard, Kansas) on the possibility of a Revolution in Germany. To my mind that is the only think that will end the War. G.

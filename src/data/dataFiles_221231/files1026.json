to do the same, & never offer us the Tomahawk anymore, in the last War when we hear that Brothers were going to fight against Brothers, we thought it strange, we hardly could believe that such wise People of the same Flesh and Blood would rise up & destroy one another, we saw they could not make a clear Stroke, because they could not distinguish between Enemies and Friends, if we had had our Senses about us, we should not have taken up the Tomahawk at any Time, either between the French & English, not in the late War, when Brothers rose up against Brothers to slay each other, Col. Pickering observed that this Conversation was unexpected to him; but he was particularly pleased with what had pass'd on all sides, & the more so because it was unpremeditated, & then People were most likely to speak the Sentiments of their Hearts, he then endeavored to enforce what we had said, & told them we were of the peaceable Society call'd Quakers, members of the same Body of People in Pennsylvania that had dealt so honestly with their fore Fathers, who lived in Peace so long as they had heard for 70 years and that we had come a great way in order to attend the Treaty, and that we knew the friendly Intention of the great Chief of the United States towards the Indian Nations, & that our Presence must be sufficient to remove from their Minds every Jealousy, which some of our

build houses but towns, you told us these houses would be to accommodate travellers in Winter, as they cannot go by water in that season, and that the travellers would want a staff in travelling that

would tend to scatter us, & make us fall in the Streets, (alluding to rum) instead of benefiting us, you want places to raise provisions, hay &c, but as soon as they settle, then they would think the

owners of this land ourselves, you requested a road, but when you settle with the Brittish, you can pass & repass by water, as the great Spirit has made that road, we have made up our minds, we wish to be the sole owners of the Land, what you want to reserve is entirely in your own favour, you told us when you left Phila, it was not expected by the United States, you would release a foot of land,

mutual condescension which is the best way to settle business, there are yet several matters to be attended to before signing the treaty, which I can best communicate to some of your Chiefs, as it would not be convenient among so great a number, viz. how the Goods & Annuity had best be appropriated, and as there are some bad people both among you & us, it would be well to fix some mode of

the treaty at fort Stanwex, I went to New York under an Apprehension that the Commissioners had not done Justice, and laid before Congress our grievances on account of the loss of our Lands according to that treaty, but the 13 fires approved of what the Commissioners had done, & in confirmation of it, they held up the Paper with a piece of Silver hanging to it, now Col: Pickering, you have told us at this treaty, what was given up by the Brittish, that it was only the Lands surrounding the fort, I am very much dissatisfied this was not communicated to us before, there has already been too much blood spilt if this had been known at the close of the War, it would have prevented any blood being Shed, I have therefore told our Warriors not to sign this, because the Sachems have been deceived, we are under them, & will listen to what they do tho we will not sign it, yet we shall abide by what they do as long as they do right, the United States & the Sachems of the 6 Nations are now making a

endeavoured to please all, both sachems & warriors, so that there was not a word of objection, the design of this Treaty was to bury all difficulties, you know I candidly disapproved the Conduct of the Commissioner at fort Stanwex; but as this treaty was to establish a firm friendship between the 6 Nations & the United States, I did not wish to bring former transactions into view, which was also the desire of your Chief Warriors, now he brings up these old matters to make a division in your Councils; but I wish for calmness & deliberation, as the subject is of importance to us both, he

Brothers we are very glad to see you, when we sent for you, our desire was that you might sit by our sides & afford your assistance to make a good peace, last year we invited you to come to Sandusky, you willingly rose from your seats and came forward, you know how things turned out, it was not the will of the great Spirit that the Treaty should take place, yet we thank you that you came so readily, we have many times heard the voice of Onas, it was always good to us, we have now heard it again, and what you have said is good, with respect to the writings by which we are bound, you say that as you are not concerned in public affairs, you think it will not be best for you to sign them, Brothers, you have made our minds easy, and we have no hard thoughts on account of your not putting your names to them__ The great spirit gave this Island to us, the white people have greatly increased, there is no difference between the red people & the white, they are all one and ought to be brothers, and live in peace one with another. \n  12.4      Afternoon, after a long & painful exercise & travel of Spirit when things inwardly much resembled the outward elements, mostly dark, cold, cloudy & squally Weather, & but little sunshine, the public business being ended, we prepar'd to go homeward, and after takeing an affectionate farewell of the family where we quarter'd & divers others, we rode about 10 Miles to Gilberts &

My tho'ts were my own, and being so different from the Ideas entertained among your people, I certainly should have carried them with me to the grave, had I not received your obligeing favour. You ask me, then, whether in my opinion civilization is favourable to human happiness. In answer to the Question, it may be answered that there are degrees of civilization from cannibals to the most polite of Uropean Nations. The question is not, then whether a degree of confinement is not conducive to happiness, but whether you, or the natives of this Land, have obtained the happy medium. On this subject, we are at present, I presume, of very different opinions, you will however allow me, in some respects, to have had the advantage of you in forming my sentiments. I was, sir, born of Indian Parents, and lived while a child among those whom you are pleased to call savages, I was afterward sent to live among the white People, and educated at one of your Schools, since which period, I have been honoured much beyond my deserts, by an acquaintance with a number of principle Characters, both in England & America.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":68480,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/68480","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ce58184b2cefe8af40c0d8b848388aa0.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ce58184b2cefe8af40c0d8b848388aa0.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ce58184b2cefe8af40c0d8b848388aa0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ce58184b2cefe8af40c0d8b848388aa0.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-28T15:09:03+00:00","modified":"2021-03-26T20:03:09+00:00","filename":"ce58184b2cefe8af40c0d8b848388aa0.jpg","authentication":"b6ab8027c679502165ab583be8883305","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":130,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3146_00067_o2.jpg","size":1066517,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

States was established when the seperate States and individuals under their Authority, undertook to treat with the Indian tribes respecting the sale of their Lands.  But the case is now intirely altered.  The general government only has the power to treat with the Indian Nations, and any Treaty formed and held without its authority will not be binding. How then is the security for the remainder of your Lands.  No State or persons can purchase your Lands, unless at some publick treaty held under the Authority of the U. States.  The General Government will never consent to your being defrauded, but it will protect you in all your rights.  Learn well and let it be heard by every person in your Nation that the President of the U. States declairs that the General Govert. considers himself bound to protect you in all the Land secured to you by the Treaty at Fort Stanwex the 22 day of October 1784 such part as you may since fairly sold to persons properly authorized to purchase of you. You complain that J - L- and O - P. have obtained your Lands, assisted by Mr. S - of Niagara, and that they have not complied with their agreement.  It appears upon inquiry of the Governor of New York that J - L- was not legally authorised to treat with you and that any thing he did with you have been declared nul and void so that you may out?assy? on that amount?  But it doth not appear from any proofs, yet in the possession of Govert that O - P- has defrauded you, however if you should have any just cause of complaint against him and can make satisfactory proof thereof, the Federal Corts will be open to you for redress as to all other persons.  But your great object seems to be the security of your remaining Lands, and I have therefore upon this point ment to be sufficiently strong and cleare that in future you cannot be defrauded of your Lands.  That you possess the right to sell and the right of refusing to sell your Lands; that therefore the sale of your Lands in future, will depend entirely on yourselves.  But when you may find it for your intrest to sell any part of your Lands the U. States must be present by their agent and will be your security that you shall not be defrauded in the bargain you may make.  It will however be important, that before you make any further sale of your Land, that you should determine among yourselves, who are the persons among you that shall give such convayences thereof as shall be binding upon your Nation and forever prosecute? all disputes relative to the vilidity of the sale. That besides the before mentioned security for your Lands you will perceive by the Laws of Congress for regulating land and intrinsic with Indian Tribes The fatherly care of the U.

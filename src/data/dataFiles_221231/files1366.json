On approaching its shores it is seen to be very low and ?, but there are land marks such as the 'Three Trees' which are a collection of ? trees in a one group & four single ones about the center of the island, ? along the beach formerly there was some difficulty in making the bar or pass into the harbor ? to the ? latitude & longitude that was given.   This and other nautical points have been ? ascertained, & there being no want of pilots, makes this place easy to access.

I shall not finish this till to morrow so shall keep you in advance of the times. Father is giving a temperance adress to night on the Hall, the children are gone, so mother and I am alone. Good night Sarah. Dont you here the crutch? as it used to was. I shall get up early to morrow morning so once more a fond good night. \nFriday\nDear Sarah -- the to morrow has gone and nought is left but the yesterday of to day; another meeting and another parting; a few more & soon will come the Last -- the last --how mournfully it sounds -- how mournful it would be, were it not for the promis of that better land where partings are unknown. No sickness there, -- No weary wasting of the frame away, No fearful shrinking from the midnight air No dread of Summer hot & fervid ray. No hidden grief -- No wild and cheerless vision of despair No vain insisting  for a swift relief No tearful eyes, no broken hearts are There. I believe I'm almost as bad as your crazy patient I don't do any thing but make mistakes just see what a blunder I made up there. hand -- image I'm almost ashamed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":35832,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/35832","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/1d0f0f427bcd661179e146007ceea455.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/1d0f0f427bcd661179e146007ceea455.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/1d0f0f427bcd661179e146007ceea455.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1d0f0f427bcd661179e146007ceea455.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T21:31:17+00:00","modified":"2020-05-08T16:29:28+00:00","filename":"1d0f0f427bcd661179e146007ceea455.jpg","authentication":"ad56c9c531e57b11bcdddb211240cb34","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_08_fl_340_011_04_o2.jpg","size":1066102,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2719,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.036304945990491999108229492776445113122463226318359375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160223"],"TimeCreated":["050406"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160223"],"TimeCreated":["050406"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160223"],"TimeCreated":["050406"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1d0f0f427bcd661179e146007ceea455.jpg","FileDateTime":1507757122,"FileSize":1066102,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2719\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2719,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:02:24 14:47:19","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:23 05:04:06","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:23 05:04:06","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":99,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2414,"ExifImageLength":3196,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":154,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/154","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"to send this scribble to you. wont you please excuse it?

I got a letter from him, a few days ago, saying he had not quite finished his arrangements at home, so he could leave yet. \u2013 but hoped to in a few days. So we do not know yet how soon he will start. I have been getting some of the Bills filled out \u2013 have got all those of this State and some other done. I do not think it would be best to try to get \n\nin margins:\nwill do with it but Wm. is able to go to R. tomorrow he will take it and try to do the best he can \u2013 either send or sell. It will not do to keep it as he may not be able to go down for some time. A little then might shut us up. We hope to finish Mothers tub this month. Do you think butter wold sell better if it was colored? That opinion seems to be gaining ground here. We have not tried it yet. I do not cough nearly as much as I did especially nights I feel stronger and have more heart to make plans for next summer.

It is a libel on God to say that he is too good to punish sin, or to condemn the soul for the little wrong that it does in this life- but rather \"let God be true and every man a liar\".","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":46432,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/46432","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/368264dedcd3ca9971f2d6f37547c8b6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/368264dedcd3ca9971f2d6f37547c8b6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/368264dedcd3ca9971f2d6f37547c8b6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/368264dedcd3ca9971f2d6f37547c8b6.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-03T19:14:54+00:00","modified":"2020-11-11T22:54:03+00:00","filename":"368264dedcd3ca9971f2d6f37547c8b6.jpg","authentication":"2e63bc25438e237f99b34692c44b12ef","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_taylor_e_bx_01_fl_013_01_012_o2.jpg","size":1528993,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2838,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049884928092292002421714869342395104467868804931640625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170924"],"TimeCreated":["224656"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170924"],"TimeCreated":["224656"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170924"],"TimeCreated":["224656"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"368264dedcd3ca9971f2d6f37547c8b6.jpg","FileDateTime":1509736323,"FileSize":1528993,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2838\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2838,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/9.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:09:25 10:54:43","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.06666666666666699880838820035933167673647403717041015625,"FNumber":9,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:09:24 22:46:56","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:09:24 22:46:56","ShutterSpeedValue":3.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":6.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2453,"ExifImageLength":3111,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":205,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/205","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"12\n3rd\nA third method to which unknown resort is ceremony- and this is of two kinds. 1st- The ceremonies of the heathen, which have no reference to the religion of the Bible, and which consist of unknown torture, pilgrimages unknown, all of which, to an enlightened mind, are evidently useless; and hence, we shall pass them by with only this statement.

There yet remains one thought in this enumeration - which I must pass with a brief mention.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":46457,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/46457","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/fc35df50bab6604ccba82df08078ae4e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/fc35df50bab6604ccba82df08078ae4e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/fc35df50bab6604ccba82df08078ae4e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fc35df50bab6604ccba82df08078ae4e.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-03T19:16:03+00:00","modified":"2021-04-11T21:00:24+00:00","filename":"fc35df50bab6604ccba82df08078ae4e.jpg","authentication":"299a0f04f36d906f2b2af376a4e02cc1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_taylor_e_bx_01_fl_014_01_013_o2.jpg","size":1343073,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2844,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.043726656508830001601761949814317631535232067108154296875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170924"],"TimeCreated":["224919"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170924"],"TimeCreated":["224919"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170924"],"TimeCreated":["224919"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"fc35df50bab6604ccba82df08078ae4e.jpg","FileDateTime":1509736324,"FileSize":1343073,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2844\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2844,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/9.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:09:25 10:55:47","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.06666666666666699880838820035933167673647403717041015625,"FNumber":9,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:09:24 22:49:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:09:24 22:49:19","ShutterSpeedValue":3.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":6.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2394,"ExifImageLength":3030,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":205,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/205","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"13\nWhen X came the world was ignorant of the method of divine acceptance. \nOf course, this could not have been otherwise with their darkened conception of God - and no feeling of moral obligation.

Let us consider for a moment this light as it is in X. We must keep in view that it is God in X. As sinners we can not look upon God directly. His light is too dazzling - we cannot look upon the natural sun without the aid of a mediating glass - His piercing light is destructive to the eye. So God out of X is a consuming fire.

Is there any one class of men who hold the exclusive right to the possessorship of this world?   We answer yes. Meekness of spirit is connected with rest of mind- and this makes much out of little.

From the present aspect of affairs I judge that it will be by all deemed necessary to have the Agency and the military post situated near together, if they do no even soo become one and the same thing.        General Sheridan and General Hazen seem to agree that the two must near one another, and in the selection of the locality, the former wishes in the establishment of the post, to accommodate the Indian interests, while the latter desires to locate the Agency so as not to incommode the troops.    Both rather seem to incline to the Valley of the Washita River Valley [strike].  I regret this as [strike] and feel certain that they would change their minds were they to examine the country as carefully as I have done.     I spent several weeks last summer in visiting the [strike] all parts of the Comanche and Kiowa Reserve except the uninviting North Western portion, with a view to intelligently deciding upon the best point for the new post, having the Indian question my own [strike] mind at the same time.  I have now as [strike] reviewed the subject giving it close attention for several days, and my opinions on the [2 word strike] have not changed.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":66628,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/66628","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/afd5b90383eefde7ba682278add4e96f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/afd5b90383eefde7ba682278add4e96f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/afd5b90383eefde7ba682278add4e96f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/afd5b90383eefde7ba682278add4e96f.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-24T18:30:19+00:00","modified":"2020-02-24T20:31:31+00:00","filename":"afd5b90383eefde7ba682278add4e96f.jpg","authentication":"ecea3b1c86677c2bfbfdfae2269684a4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3039_BX04_FL208_00002_o2.jpg","size":693016,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2282,"compression_ratio":0.0562385172201119998280915979194105602800846099853515625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20120612"],"TimeCreated":["084145+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20120612"],"TimeCreated":["084145+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20120612"],"TimeCreated":["084145+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"afd5b90383eefde7ba682278add4e96f.jpg","FileDateTime":1521916173,"FileSize":693016,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2282\"","Height":2282,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2282,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:24 08:52:56","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":312},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":978,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6015},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:12 08:41:45","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:12 08:41:45","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":6,"SubSecTimeOriginal":6,"SubSecTimeDigitized":6,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2282,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.71670190270015154965221881866455078125,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.90476190480012519401498138904571533203125,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1009,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1009","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"2.\n\n    There is not in my own mind the slightest doubt that the best location for both the Post and the Agency is at the junction of Medicine Bluff Creek with Cache Creek at the Eastern base of the Witchita Mountains, about seven miles E. by S. from Mount Scott.  So confident do I feel that time will prove every interest of the government to be best conserved by the selection of that locality for the establishment of both Agency and Post, that I venture to give you my reasons for this belief.\n    Looking first to the selection of a point for building a frontier post for purely military purposes.  I used this language in my official report dated July 14, 1868, forwarded to Department Head Quarters after my careful examination of this whole section of country:\n    \" I am decidedly of the opinion that for the purpose of controlling the Indian tribes inclined to be lawless and troublesome, of preventing the marauding parties now so often visiting North Western Texas, and of protecting the Chickasaw and Seminole borders, and the peaceable tribes still farther West, who are endeavoring to fulfill their obligations to the government from molestation by the wild bands, a new post, to be garrisoned by cavalry, should be at once established West of Fort Arbuckle * * * I gave particular attention to the selection of the best location for such a station * * * At a point eight (8) miles North and seventy (70) miles West from Fort Arbuckle the most practicable route being about seventy-five (75) miles.  I found what I consider on the whole, the best location for a military post in the South Western portion of this Territory.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":66629,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/66629","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/21324b72611b91cc1daf31e12ecb4c20.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/21324b72611b91cc1daf31e12ecb4c20.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/21324b72611b91cc1daf31e12ecb4c20.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/21324b72611b91cc1daf31e12ecb4c20.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-24T18:30:20+00:00","modified":"2020-02-24T20:31:31+00:00","filename":"21324b72611b91cc1daf31e12ecb4c20.jpg","authentication":"15249c92f219a7510377ed24bb880ac4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3039_BX04_FL208_00003_o2.jpg","size":698040,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2282,"compression_ratio":0.05664621676891599955094847018699510954320430755615234375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20120612"],"TimeCreated":["084158+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20120612"],"TimeCreated":["084158+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20120612"],"TimeCreated":["084158+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"21324b72611b91cc1daf31e12ecb4c20.jpg","FileDateTime":1521916173,"FileSize":698040,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2282\"","Height":2282,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2282,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:24 08:52:57","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":312},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":978,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6320},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:12 08:41:58","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:12 08:41:58","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":16,"SubSecTimeOriginal":16,"SubSecTimeDigitized":16,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2282,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.71670190270015154965221881866455078125,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.90476190480012519401498138904571533203125,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1009,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1009","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"3.\n\n   \"It is a tract of high level prairie land containing about two hundred acres, situated just as the base of the range of hills which are the Eastern extremity of the Witchita Mountains.

And while the region of Medicine Bluff equals that of the Washita for fertility of soil - as a grazing country all admit that it far excels this valley. In my opinion this point is of great importance to the Indians for I believe the Comanches and Kiowas will become successful, prosperous stock raisers long before they will cultivate the soil to any extent. Even now the Indians who care more for their horses are herding them in the valley at the Eastern end of the Witchita Mts. In the connection, when it is remembered that the garrison of the Post to be established will be mainly cavalry, the fact should not be overlooked that when proposals were invited the time of October for contracts for hay for the company of cavalry ordered to this point (Ft. Cobb) to serve with General unclear each of these persons who examined the country with a view to putting in bids decided that hay could not be cut to any advantage in the Washita Valley - not at any place near to this point than the junction of Medicine Bluff Creek and Cache Creek.\nBy some it is thought that the mountain region will be a locality tending to facilitate raids into Texas by the Indians placed there, but to me it seems that the very establishment of their families so far South will prevent the Indians from endangering them by expeditions to Texas which would bring troops to

I believe much of this trouble could have been avoided by the establishment of the Post last summer of Fall as I recommended in July - and that the matter should not now be delayed until the spring rains which will postpone all work until May or June - if not begun before they commense. From what the Comanche chiefs said to General Sheridan the other day - you can see how they feel about this.\nGeneral unclear seemed to think when he first arrived that you intended him to remain at this particular spot (nor even on the Reserve of any tribe) or very near here, expended considerable labor and some money in settling himself here and while from later letters from you he feels at liberty to select any point for a permanent establishment which he may deem more suitable. I think he is rather disinclined to abandon what has been done at all and does not yet consider himself authorized to move before Spring. Moving in this country, if postponed till after the 10th of February is generally impracticable until May 10th or later.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":66638,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/66638","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7b907ba91cb5c53e485f70e93bfb27ab.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7b907ba91cb5c53e485f70e93bfb27ab.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7b907ba91cb5c53e485f70e93bfb27ab.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7b907ba91cb5c53e485f70e93bfb27ab.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-24T18:30:27+00:00","modified":"2020-04-08T22:09:15+00:00","filename":"7b907ba91cb5c53e485f70e93bfb27ab.jpg","authentication":"7272827b29c6c417bcca352897347a04","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3039_BX04_FL208_00012_o2.jpg","size":716248,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2279,"compression_ratio":0.0582003152779810017936057420229190029203891754150390625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20120612"],"TimeCreated":["084423+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20120612"],"TimeCreated":["084423+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20120612"],"TimeCreated":["084423+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7b907ba91cb5c53e485f70e93bfb27ab.jpg","FileDateTime":1521916173,"FileSize":716248,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2279\"","Height":2279,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2279,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:24 08:53:05","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":312},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":978,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6600},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:12 08:44:23","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:12 08:44:23","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":89,"SubSecTimeOriginal":89,"SubSecTimeDigitized":89,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2279,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.71670190270015154965221881866455078125,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.90476190480012519401498138904571533203125,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1009,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1009","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"By moving at once to the point I recommend all necessary buildings could be erected, the troops made comfortable before the heat of summer, and the Indians located and the ground broken and fenced for them before the season for planting, all of which will be impossible if there is a delay until Spring.

flow of water from a higher level, the likelihood of such wells being successful in this section is very favorable.\n\n  Ordinary wells would probably prove successful in certain localities, but thus far on account of the wildness of the country no attempt has been made to test the matter.\n\n   The extensive surface of country which has been described, would at first thought be supposed to possess all the essential features of a good agricultural country, but a closer inspection discloses the fact that it is almost entirely destitute of that most necessary requisite to successful

4, 1972\nDear Aunt Grace,\nFinally I have arrived at Kibbutz Hatzerim and what an experience I have had so far! Everything was rather boring until I reached Kennedy Airport. There my luggage was combed by security guards (and quite messed up!) and I was frisked by a woman guard. The flight was extremely smooth; we had two Kosher meals and a movie. At Lod airport near Tel Aviv the plane was accompanied by security trucks to the terminal - there were guards with suns on the roof of the main terminal and many inside keeping close watch on all the passengers. Evidently many of these security measures were just adopted after the recent shootings by the Japanese guerillas just inside the building. Anyway, the Kibbutz is located just a few miles west of Ber-Sheva, so we are on the northern edge of the desert instead of smack in the middle, as I had thought. The heat is unbearable anyway so it really doesn't matter. My day begins at 3:45am. I dress and report for coffee + bread at 4:15. at 4:30 we head for the fields, where we are presently picking pears. at 7:40 we go back for breakfast, at 8:30 back to the fields, and we work til lunch at 11:30. Then our time is our own until 4:30 when we have Hebrew lessons til 6:30, dinner, and an hour or two before we all fall into bed again. I say \"we\" because there are 23 Americans all living in cabins at one end of the Kibbutz. By the way , the Israelis cook the way you do -> they eat their big meal at noon and moderate ones for breakfast and dinner. So far I have shared my toilet cubicle with a toad, a dragonfly, several roaches, ants, and have been accompanied by a bat that lives in the palm tree by my door and several lizards who inhabit the cacti living the path to the bathroom. I still haven't  figured out which ear my pet mosquito prefers to buzz around at night (the only reason he doesn't get away farther is because I have my sheet pulled up to my neck!) Despite these minor little draw-backs the place is really fairly modern. They have hot + cold water, cars, modern machines for the fields, excellent food, T.V., built in sprinkling system, electricity and so on. I may not be at the Hilton but I am getting healthy and am happy and learning so much. I will write soon. The address on the back is my correct mailing address.\nP.S. My pattern size is Misses 10. It sounds cute!\nLove, Katlei","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":121750,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/121750","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5ca77d2844b4e7beb9481051b55be8b5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5ca77d2844b4e7beb9481051b55be8b5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5ca77d2844b4e7beb9481051b55be8b5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5ca77d2844b4e7beb9481051b55be8b5.jpg"},"added":"2022-05-12T19:42:59+00:00","modified":"2022-05-19T18:36:52+00:00","filename":"5ca77d2844b4e7beb9481051b55be8b5.jpg","authentication":"81de04ffd3cbf770514bd9f1e4b33ce9","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"998334948805867_midwest_ms_brown_family_box_00001_fl_00006_000005.jpg","size":2063956,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2000,"resolution_y":1343,"compression_ratio":0.2561375031025068249590503910440020263195037841796875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"],"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"]},"IPTCApplication":{"FixtureIdentifier":["998334948805867_midwest_ms_brown"],"DateCreated":["20220315"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["998334948805867_midwest_ms_brown"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"],"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0004"]},"IPTCApplication":{"FixtureIdentifier":["998334948805867_midwest_ms_brown"],"DateCreated":["20220315"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["998334948805867_midwest_ms_brown"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"],"EnvelopeRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]},"IPTCApplication":{"FixtureIdentifier":["998334948805867_midwest_ms_brown"],"DateCreated":["20220315"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["998334948805867_midwest_ms_brown"],"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1410,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1410","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"postmark    BEERSHEVA repeated in Hebrew and Arabic  17.7.72\nMs. Grace Brown\nBox 14\nHardinsburg, KY 40143\nU.S.A.\nMs. K.

This place is truly a garden of Eden in the middle of nowhere. There is an abundance of green grass, beautiful flowers and palm trees but outside of the Kibbety nothing for miles but sand and rocks. Last Saturday I went to the beach at Ashkelom on the Mediterranean. It only took two hours for me to get a lobster-red sunburn! I've finally healed enough to go back outside. The Mediterranean is beautiful but not much fun to swim in - the waves were quite high and the salt water is not exactly my favorite beverage. Thursday they held the Bedouin market in Ber-Sheva. I had counted on buying a smock with some of the embroidery on it that's supposed to be so beautiful. i was so disappointed!! Most of it is machine-made and very poorly at that - they wanted a fortune for it, even after trying to talk them down! It was interesting though. The Bedouins were selling piles and piles of marijuana and hashish right out in the open - evidently they are exempt from Israeli law. You could smell the stuff in the air so they were undoubtedly smoking it too. There were camels, goats, sheep, chicken and cows being sold, piles of vegetables of all kinds, and quite an assortment of souvenireers and other miscellaneous junk. Alot of the younger girls got a little upset when the Bedouins offered to \"help\" them try on smocks - their fingers just got just a little too long, and the girls didn't quite know what to do. We are still picking pears during the day, and, I might add, in our sleep too!! Someone \"heard\" that we were going to switch to peaches next week and the place nearly went crazy with excitement.

What a trip it was! We went first of all directly east to Masada on the Dead Sea. I don't know if you've ever heard of it, but Masada is a huge, flat-topped mountain which was the last fortress to be taken by the Romans in 73 AD. Herod built two gorgeous palaces there --- the ruins consist mostly of broken columns, fragments of wall frescoes and floor mosaics, but they give you a good idea of how beautiful it all must have been. It is of special meaning to most Jews because the zealots who lived there all chose suicide (1000 of them) rather than capture by the Romans. To this day every Israeli soldier recites in his oath, \"Masada shall not fall again!\" From there we moved northward to Engeddy Ein Gedi, an oasis in the midst of the mountains. If I didn't know better I would have sworn it was the Garden of Eden. You have to work to get there and really know where you're going (our guide was excellent!) because you'd never know it was there otherwise. It was well shaded by the mountains; there were little pools, bubbling brooks, waterfalls (some of them were small enough that we could slide down them in our swimsuits), caves with hanging moss, tiny flowers and trees. The water was as clear as what you'd run in a tub and was safe even to drink. It was just like something from a fairytale! From there we went to Nahal Arugot, another oasis, and then to Qumaran, the city where the Dead Sea Scrolls were written and which sits in the midst of the 14 caves where the scrolls were found. All of these, by the way, were just yards from the Dead Sea, a few minutes drive from each other, and in previously occupied territory. Before 1967 all of it belonged to Jordan. There were Israeli Phantom Jets flying over the water constantly; you could in fact see Jordan on the other side of the Dead Sea. From Qumaran we drove through Jericho; it was the first \"disappointment\" of the trip since it is now nothing more than a run-down Arab refugee camp, but it was interesting nevertheless. We did get a chance to swim in the Dead Sea. The entire group was in hysterics!! Its the one body of water I can actually stay up in!! You can honestly sit on the water and float, read a newspaper or whatever. The water is so heavy that you can't drown and it is so full of minerals that it doesn't even feel wet. It was fun while it lasted but we all itched and burned (in a number of places) for a good 24 hours! From Jericho we went to Jerusalem, & ate dinner in an Arabic restaurant. They served a sort of salad with mint in it and something which look like cigar butts soaked in oil but turned out to be nice rolled in grape leaves! (CONTNUED!)","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":121754,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/121754","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/9776ebb0be1be7641613485c413a9077.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/9776ebb0be1be7641613485c413a9077.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/9776ebb0be1be7641613485c413a9077.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9776ebb0be1be7641613485c413a9077.jpg"},"added":"2022-05-12T19:43:03+00:00","modified":"2022-05-19T18:27:52+00:00","filename":"9776ebb0be1be7641613485c413a9077.jpg","authentication":"5aecf9831cefe64be2642708b127d5e1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"998334948805867_midwest_ms_brown_family_box_00001_fl_00006_000009.jpg","size":2257974,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

we had a nice dish with lamb shishkabob. On the whole it was all horrible but again, an experience. The only redeeming thing was the Coca-cola. It was real, honest to goodness Coke; the bottle was written in both English and Hebrew! Unfortunately we didn't get to see much of Jerusalem in the eight hours we were there. We started at the Citadel in the old city, saw a couple of Synagogues in the Jewish Quarter, the Wailing Wall, the Dome of the Rock (a beautiful mosque) and got to walk through (or should I say had walk through) the Arab market to get there. What a mess that place is!! We left Jerusalem at about 2pm and went to Bethlehem about a five minute drive away. Ive never been much of one for organized religion but I have to admit it felt good to visit someplace that was Christian rather than Jewish or Muslim. We walked through the Church of the Nativity, St. Catherines Church and St. Jerome's Grotto; all are connected in one. I saw the place where Christ was born, a place where he was visited by the wise men (the monks there said that Mary moved him to a spot a few feet away because the original birthplace was too cold & drafty). Right in front of the second place they had a stand of prayer candles. I lit four; one was for you. The icons inside were all faded but beautiful nevertheless. I'm glad I had a course in Byzantine Art before I left. From Bethlehem we drove back through Hebron and Ber-Sheva to home. Starting Wednesday we have four days to travel on our own and then another four-day tour. One of the girls I'm rooming with has relatives in Haifa. We thought we'd spend a day or two there and then return to Jerusalem for a better look. Ruthie is Jewish so we're going to split it up. Friday we watch the Christian Pilgrimmage down the Via Dolorosa to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Saturday we attend an Orthodox Jewish ceremony. We still aren't sure where the tour will take us (four days this time!) but I will definitely write and tell you all about it. Meanwhile I'm getting a little variety in my work schedule---the dining room and greenhouse---and still being \"adversely affected\" by and all the fantastic fruits & vegetables here. Your letters take 6 or 7 days to get here, so do keep them

12, 1972\nDear Aunt Grace, \nI've just returned from my last tour of the country before I leave. It was really quite different from the first. We were given four days of free time from the 2nd to 6th during which time Ruthie (one of my room mates) and I went to Haifa to visit her pen pal and family. They are Orthodox, so it was quite an interesting experience for me. From there we went to Jerusalem again. I believe tou could spend a month there and still not see everything! We arrived on a Friday, just in time to follow the pilgrimmage down the Via Dolorosa to the Stations of the cross. It ended at the Chruch of the Holy Sepulchre which is built ouer Calvary Hill and the Tomb where Christ was supposedly buried. I walked through the Garden of Gethsemame, sat in the Church of the Agonies. I also visited the Tomb of the Prophets (cold, dark, and clammy!) which had to be the most hair-raising experience of my life. There wasn't anything in the tomb but tunnels and holes but the little old man who led us around looked like Bella Legosi reincarnated. He carried an old pop bottle filled with kerosene as our lamp and had the habit of walking behind us with the light as we made our way thru the tunnels. It was pitch black since it was all underground so we didn't know what to expect!! You could hear the bats squeak now + then but thank heavens they didn't come near us! The next day we visited the Israeli Museum - I saw the head Sea Scrolls and all the artifacts which they have dug up over the past few centuries in a lot of the places I've been so far. It was really quite exciting!! The tour they took us on after that was mostly geographical, we didn't see many historical sites - just road and borders. We started out going thru Jerusalem and northward to the Galilee. We stayed in Tiberias for two nights, between times they drove us around the new borders of Syria and Lebanon and through old battlefields + bunkers. Unfortunately we couldn't set into the Golam Heights for military reasons. As it stood the bus driver carried a pistol in his belt and the guide brought a sub-machine gun on board. So it must have been slightly dangerous as it was. We drove to the top of Mt. Gilboa, went to Capernaum where St. Peter lived, and saw the Mt. of the beatitudes. The last nite we stayed on the shore of the Mediterranean near Rosh Haniler and had a barbecue. On the way home we drove thru Tel-Aviv and Jaffa, though we didn't have time to stay + stop. Now I set to pick peaches til I leave at the end of the month. I'm still arguing with the Airline over my ticket so even that is not certain. Don't write anymore after the 22nd, that should be about right!

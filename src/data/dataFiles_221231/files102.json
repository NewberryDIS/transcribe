By means of a large water wheel, and other machinery, water is forced from a well near the brook, into pipes which carry it, not only underlined: into, but underlined:  all over the Seminary building - The old cisterns are taken away, and, in their stead, are convenient water closets, with bathing rooms &c, &c - By means of a large furnace in the \"Dom Hall\", part of this vast quantity of soft water, is heated, and we can obtain water, cold or hot, in any story, without descending any stairs - You cannot think howunderlined:   great these improvements appear, to us, who have carried water from the \"boiling room\" to the \"fourth story\" so many times - Would you like to know that \"106\" is occupied by two new scholars, and your friend Nellie Partridge? I like my tenement very much.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":25507,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/25507","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/2ef212ed3029b6d7c13690265c90673e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/2ef212ed3029b6d7c13690265c90673e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/2ef212ed3029b6d7c13690265c90673e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2ef212ed3029b6d7c13690265c90673e.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-05T15:47:02+00:00","modified":"2022-12-29T05:29:31+00:00","filename":"2ef212ed3029b6d7c13690265c90673e.jpg","authentication":"89d5f503bad1f35a357b669bfde57bd4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_05_fl_176_004_03_o2.jpg","size":1060790,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2772,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.035433368072256998804192562602111138403415679931640625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["043140"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["043140"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["043140"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["043140"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["043140"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["043140"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"2ef212ed3029b6d7c13690265c90673e.jpg","FileDateTime":1507218151,"FileSize":1060790,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2772\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2772,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:19 10:23:57","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 04:31:40","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 04:31:40","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":6,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":102,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/102","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"My \"Domestic work\" is to take care of the fire in the new furnace and to succeed Jennie Everett in \"waiting upon the milk man\" - Of course I like my work, though it is underlined:  responsible.

I only offered it to you because it was a gilt edge - A-1 loan and the interest would be paid always prompt. All he has to do here is to let it be Known that he wants the loan and there will be plenty of loaners ready to take it.  I wanted you to have it if I could get it because Mr Gross wrote me that he wanted your money placed where there would be no question as to its being A-1- security and no trouble to you.

Before this you have doubtless heard from your brother. We called sometime ago and a day was set to have our daguerreotype taken. When the day came Abbie did not feel able to go and the next day we were both thrown from a sleigh and my face was so much disfigured that I did not care to send such a picture. So passed sevel? days & in the meantime we learned that your brother was quite sick and had gone home. The last time we saw him he looked very tired and I thought low spirited. We cannot hear how he is and I hope he is already well. . . . . . My classes get along nicely. I have one that is real good. Miller Cobb + those boys who study latin unclear in Miss Becker's class in Geography so I have them about 17 of these in my class. I hear them alone. We use now Carlee's Geography. I like it a great deal better than I did our old one. How I would like if it were best to pry into the future just a little way. We will try to write more next time at least I will. Lately there is little material for a diary and I am sorry to say I have neglected it. Did you hear the alarm of fire which early one evening not long since was given? Somebody had placed a small quantity of pitch &c on two of the desks in our school room and lighted them. Some men passing discovered the fire before it had done more than to scorch 2 desks & burn a few books. By tracks in the snow it was plain they had got in at the window. \n  A barn on Cornhill was set one of the coldest nights we have had wind burned? down together with 2 dwellings a store and another barn. These & other fires have been the work of an incendiary.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":25603,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/25603","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/54740aaeae648a8cfe64bd3ce2f8198f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/54740aaeae648a8cfe64bd3ce2f8198f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/54740aaeae648a8cfe64bd3ce2f8198f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/54740aaeae648a8cfe64bd3ce2f8198f.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-05T15:51:34+00:00","modified":"2020-05-21T04:43:30+00:00","filename":"54740aaeae648a8cfe64bd3ce2f8198f.jpg","authentication":"e2934783dde6fe55d24c8488ab670976","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_05_fl_184_003_01_o2.jpg","size":958656,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2306,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.038492820661077002675209968174385721795260906219482421875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["044225"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["044225"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["044225"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["044225"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["044225"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["044225"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"54740aaeae648a8cfe64bd3ce2f8198f.jpg","FileDateTime":1507218155,"FileSize":958656,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2306\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2306,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:19 11:18:17","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 04:42:25","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 04:42:25","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":102,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/102","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"College Hill July 26\/57\nVery dear Jennie\nI have delayed answering your welcome letter hoping that I might have a suitable situation to offer you.

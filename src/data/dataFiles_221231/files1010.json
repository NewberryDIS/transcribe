Sir I have the honor to report the return of Capt Walsh 10th Cavalry, who recovered only three of the mules stolen from the Post Corrall on the 13th instant: a few horses and ponies supposed to belong to the Kiowas were gathered up by his command and brought in. The trail was lost near the north fork of Red River about a hundred miles from this Post. by being merged into and obliterated by the trails of large herds of Buffalo. Captain Walsh had with him Lieuts Myrick, Harmon and Myers, and I am satisfied that every effort was made to recapture the mules; the command travelled a distance of 80 miles within the first twentyfour (24) hours. some of the Wichitas deserted the command before they arrived at the North fork and the balance were of little service after they struck the Buffalo. I have just learned from the Pen-e-tegh-kas sent out that the animals were taken by the Kiowas. that Kicking Bird was about starting in and this movement was made to prevent his joining the Indians here. if this information should prove correct, I have arranged with Mr. Tatum Indian Agent to have the estimated value of the mules stolen to be taken from the annuities?

The corn raised on the school garden this year was planted that way as an experiment and without irrigation was the best corn grown on the entire reserve, from this experience I am led to believe that very fair corn can be raised in many parts of the reservation without the use of water.

This proposition I deem absurd and impracticable, with the present reservation limits there is sufficient territory to accomodate the entire tribe for years to come.  I am heartily in accord with the polity of the Indian office encouraging the Indians to take up land under the law who desire to remain out of the reservation.  The difficulty I see however growing out of this is that in the near future as settlements progress, white people may crown in upon them, cut off their ranges for pasture and compel them to abandon their homes.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":66792,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/66792","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3f58be79295a208d9b90c11743a4abc3.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3f58be79295a208d9b90c11743a4abc3.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3f58be79295a208d9b90c11743a4abc3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3f58be79295a208d9b90c11743a4abc3.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-24T18:39:40+00:00","modified":"2020-01-29T21:28:46+00:00","filename":"3f58be79295a208d9b90c11743a4abc3.jpg","authentication":"cfc59de2f169c6158fc6db1a22f3d011","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3039_BX04_FL227_00013_o2.jpg","size":1127938,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2262,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0461709565445199976441159606110886670649051666259765625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120612"],"TimeCreated":["114023+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120612"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120612"],"TimeCreated":["114023+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120612"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120612"],"TimeCreated":["114023+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120612"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3f58be79295a208d9b90c11743a4abc3.jpg","FileDateTime":1521916712,"FileSize":1127938,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2262\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2262,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:07:25 14:46:02","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":180},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:12 11:40:23","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:12 11:40:23","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":11,"SubSecTimeDigitized":11,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2399,"ExifImageLength":3818,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.71670190270015154965221881866455078125,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.90476190480012519401498138904571533203125,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1010,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1010","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"13.\nthis will evidently be the case so long as the Indians continue in the business of stock raising, as no considerable amount of stock could subsist on one hundred and sixty acres in this country.

I think both Indians and whites are learning the fact that peace is better than constant trouble.  Many complaints however are made to the Agent of Indians stealing and running off horses belonging to white ranch men.  In such cases the Agent always renders all aid that lies in his power to assist in the recovery of lost stock, but he finds in many instances where the Navajos are charged with stealing horses the animals have only strayed from the owner.  Very few Indians permanently reside over the San Juan river, the Northern boundary.  Although they sometimes make temporary raids to the annoyance of the ranch men in that section.

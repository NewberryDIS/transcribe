Rob, likes very much to go to a reformed church on 7th Ave Dr Farrars ch. and I have been with him there Sunday evening. It is one of the finest in Brooklyn, but I think the attractions to him is the tenor singer who is blind. He is a youngerly man and has a most beautiful voice. His wife is a musician and she teaches him the solo\u00a0? anthems and hymns for each servial? and he stands there and sings so earnestly","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":31129,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/31129","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ed23047100f633b5ea86fd60f3ac9f52.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ed23047100f633b5ea86fd60f3ac9f52.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ed23047100f633b5ea86fd60f3ac9f52.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ed23047100f633b5ea86fd60f3ac9f52.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-09T16:55:37+00:00","modified":"2020-09-19T17:10:54+00:00","filename":"ed23047100f633b5ea86fd60f3ac9f52.jpg","authentication":"95a3edf57689a942de83cca9ea18222a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_07_fl_226_007_03_o2.jpg","size":1193437,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2389,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046255096662171001076213627811739570461213588714599609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160219"],"TimeCreated":["042541"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160219"],"TimeCreated":["042541"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160219"],"TimeCreated":["042541"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ed23047100f633b5ea86fd60f3ac9f52.jpg","FileDateTime":1507568108,"FileSize":1193437,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2389\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2389,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:02:23 10:01:12","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008000000000000000166533453693773481063544750213623046875,"FNumber":5.5999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:19 04:25:41","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:19 04:25:41","ShutterSpeedValue":6.96578400000000019787194105447269976139068603515625,"ApertureValue":4.97085400000000010578560249996371567249298095703125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2046,"ExifImageLength":3082,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":130,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/130","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"2\n\nand with so much expression. it is as good as a sermon to hear him.

I ought to have written a little each day for every day has been so full of incidents that would interest you who are so far away from your home -- which are not so easy to recall, and lose interest as they become a art of the past. Sam and I came here four weeks ago last Thursday to spend a few days on the hills revisiting old memories it is over twenty four years since he was here before -- The first days he spent it John Watkins coming here to begin the haying and a jolly time we had getting the hay in all nice & dry in one weeks time. It was a beautiful week, sunshine yet not too hot. The breezes made it just nice for work and help dry the hay fast -- Sam did good work each day which gave him an appetite & strength and brought refreshing sleep which he had been a stranger to for a long time. He came home all worn out, nervous, couldnt eat or sleep as a man ought. He took electricity of Mrs. Shepherd in Utica for two weeks. Then before coming up here he bought a battery so I could give it him, which I did every other night the first two weeks. Now he is so much better and sleeps so well he only gets it occasionally -- you will be surprised to know that Anna did her part in the hay field -- riding in the load, I driving as they loaded up. The men moving us about from side to side till they had a big load upon which we rode to the barn then we girls would sit in the mow inhaling its fragrance and watching the men do their work. I too learned to use the horse rake very successfully. It was my first experience in haying but I trust it is not to be my last -- for I enjoyed it all even the hurry & excitement of four or five meals a day, then there was the chickens to look after.

The building that fell they say had a permit for a three story house and they built seven stories. No wonder it fell. I do not believe the storm was severe at Osawatomie, for I have not seen that place mentioned in the papers. The storm passed over part of Harper Co. and they had a severe hail storm near where cousin Edward lives.

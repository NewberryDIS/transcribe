Though nothing very special, there is much I want to say if I could talk it: I have my good girl back & have not quite so much household care as for a number of weeks past. I have been sewing on the machine this morning, getting initiation in its mysteries, for it is really quite an art to use it skillfully: I have not attempted anything very nice on it yet, have just made a pair of chemises for Libby on all except gathering; this can be done but I cannot yet. I was not probably more than two hours about it including all my stops, breaking thread, taking out crooked work & doing over again so you can imagine what a help & comfort it will be: I have about thirty yards of unbleached cotton to make up & the work will be really quite a pleasure to do it on the machine. Nettie is not yet as much versed in its use as I am but Isaac can do quite well is much taken up with it, he calls aloud for work to do on it, whenever he can share time to spend a while upon it. Isaac has been\nhere this P. M. sewing on machine  Wilder enjoying himself with Libby who is & glad to have any thing to amuse though not also to open her eyes The docter has not been very well for a few days the weather has been unfavorable for health so warm raining & wanting a fresh brisk cold air.

Aug 28th\n  Dear Nettie I commence a letter to you but have not much to write as seems quite dull here now and I should  be decidedly lonely if we had not so much  to do  as we leave no time for anything namely but work, work. We have had two rainy days, steady rain, pouring all day on the windows and roof with misty lowering clouds in the sky, but still and warm very propitious for sewing steadily; this morning it is clear, and every thing looks delightfully; the river has risen so much that the water can be seen for quite a distance, all the rocks I presume are covered. Yesterday a colored gentleman from Phil. lectured on slavery, free soil: he had a large audience in spite of the rain; he is an educated man Presbyterian minister.

Did it not make you sick\u00a0? and have you got well over it\u00a0? I am  very glad your situation is in general so pleasant. The reason I should judge is not so favorable for health or enjoyment as usual is that climate, here the winter is truly delightful clear, bright days succeeding each other , fine sleighing , the weather  just cold enough to be pleasantly exhilarating. there has not been a storm during this month, rarely a cloud in the sky I have enjoyed the winter here for much though chiefly within doors for having few occasions to call me out, I must plead guilty to having slighted the health infusing Borean breezes perhaps.

I am glad you are so happy and have so many favorable things in your situation there; in respect to religious privileges, opportunities of being useful, and congenial society, which last is a blessing to be highly prized, especially in that part of the world. It seems Isaac is very busy too much so I fear, -- it seems sad to me to have the whole of life crowded with cares, responsibility of incessant business, every one needs some leisure to clear and calm the thoughts, and enoble one to ' take an observation' upon themselves.

Perhaps it is not his duty to take the charge of so much on the sabbath; fear he does not give himself time to take care of and give rest to his own spirit.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94431,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94431","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5cc03c735876a5aa826aa09ece996d29.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5cc03c735876a5aa826aa09ece996d29.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5cc03c735876a5aa826aa09ece996d29.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5cc03c735876a5aa826aa09ece996d29.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:51:04+00:00","modified":"2020-10-19T13:46:58+00:00","filename":"5cc03c735876a5aa826aa09ece996d29.jpg","authentication":"2c31f73807599e78ee5cc34b198d3ad8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_09_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1405199,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2993,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0434717736446769975611204017695854417979717254638671875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["001827"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["001827"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["001827"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5cc03c735876a5aa826aa09ece996d29.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649018,"FileSize":1405199,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2993\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2993,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"16mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:33:26","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:18:27","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:18:27","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2653,"ExifImageLength":3191,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"furniture in Boston, they have two pleasant chambers on one of the pleasantest streets in Bangor: opposite them is Dr. Ladd's pretty garden with summer house and large old trees, and farther back a green terrace with shrubs and flowers: We think Eliab very fortunate in securing such good accommodations especially so large and comfortable a sleeping room.\nI am going to day to help her make the carpet and it is time to go now so I will defer the writing till I come back.

I should like much to read  'Littels' but doubt whether it is so pleas and elevated in character as the Eclectic Monetry? which it seems me furnishes as much reading of that kind as one can attend to improve. I am reading Upham on the Will and Campbell's Philosophy of Rhetoric.  I read Villette a while ago. It is better I think than Shirley- is very natural and life-like, but perhaps hardly repaying the time of perusal.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94435,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94435","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4832e498dc51677f329871a94dee8bf6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4832e498dc51677f329871a94dee8bf6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4832e498dc51677f329871a94dee8bf6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4832e498dc51677f329871a94dee8bf6.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:51:09+00:00","modified":"2020-10-19T17:51:47+00:00","filename":"4832e498dc51677f329871a94dee8bf6.jpg","authentication":"10f149f34ab4230d18918a72a455d275","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_09_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1373128,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2843,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044720886908716998842105994071971508674323558807373046875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["001848"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["001848"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["001848"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4832e498dc51677f329871a94dee8bf6.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649018,"FileSize":1373128,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2843\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2843,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:33:34","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:18:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:18:48","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3111,"ExifImageLength":3939,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"of much consequence, and therefore properly deserving of mention.

H. much more new, than Milo, but containing a valuable water privilege. Cousins Abby and Esther Williams spent two or three days here about a fortnight ago;- they are residing at Royalston now, where they work at the tailors trade. Joseph A. Stevens who called here before Joseph went, is now assistant. teacher in a school at Troy N. Y.

Think how many years of your life have been spent in vanity and thoughtlessness:- in rebellion and sin;- how many precious opportunities for securing the heart of great price, have been forever lost, and their account sealed up for eternity & fear lest the day of grace be over, and you left- a hardened sinner + the dear brother, put off this subject, make an effort to give your thoughts her ? subject, it is an easy thing to put off religion to live along without any serious concern for the soul. the want of serious consideration, has been the ruin of thousands who meant to repent before death but who neglected the subject from day to day Heb. 3:13,15=4: Isa. 55: 6-9-\nJune 11th Lucy arrived here safely sat. morning. Almeda's health is better, she is able to ride out, has walked to meeting once, goes up and down stairs, but has to be very careful; the children are well. I was very glad to hear by Lucy that you are in another boarding place and so good an one; endeavour to improve all the means in your power: gain an easy agreeable manner and address: seek the friendship of the truly pious;- learn the art of expressing your thoughts in conversation with ease and propriety: be sure and be neat in your dress and appearance & I think it important, if possible, that you should dress decently well; write word what clothes you are in need of, and what books you need & I will do what I can about getting them when I come. Study the bible- read the Student's Manual- try to be methodical, use above little mortification- write often and particularly to all of us, and in fine do just right.\n(expect you will laugh, in spite of all my serious advice) so goodbye  E.A.

Mr. Worcester's school has been small this term, only 32 at examination: they appeared well.\nIt is surprising that more do not avail themselves of their advantages here, -- how glad Eliab would be, of the opportunity to attend that school a year or two.

If this is true in the affairs of ordinary life, is it not much more so in religion? I am sure the greatest hindrance I have had to progress in these things of religion, has been a failure in acting up promptly to the dictates of conscience, particularly in little things:  a wavering mind as well as failure and neglect of duty, brings doubt and darkness on the mind and leads to unbelief, against which young converts, especially, need to set a watch.  In cases of conversion which are marked and striking in their character there is less danger in this source than in the more common cases, where the change is so gradual that the individual cannot himself tell the precise time when he was renewed in the spirit of his mind: the question whether this great deed has taken place, is to be determined by your present willingness to do what God requires, as I read today in one of Nevin's sermons: - he says - Are you willing to accept of Christ as your 'substitute and surely, to be cleansed by his blood, to be clothed with his righteousness, to sit at his feet? Are you ready to be evermore his devoted disciple, and to glorify God with your body and spirit, which are his?

Is it not strange that they should settle so strong an abolitionist after finding so much fault on that account with Mr. Wells? I am glad Mr. P. is going there, hope he will be the means of doing much good there.

May you consider it well and be guided aright in the path of duty. - I have taken up in writing to you rather more than your share of the paper therefore I will stop short now, and Dear brother Joseph begin a short epistle to you in which I will first give a few items of information about myself: first, I enjoy excellent health and good spirits, drink neither coffee or tea, and am pleasantly situated at my new boarding place, just across the street from Mr. P's church, & on Broadway.\nThe family consists of Mr. & Mrs. Sylvester and seven children two of whom are at sea a gentleman and his wife just married - and four gentlemen boarders, making in all, a family of 16 persons. The three eldest sons, two of whom are twins, and all those between the ages of 21 and 23, follow the sea though one is at home now on account of poor health, was unfortunate and lost all his wages, was sick in a hospital &c. One son has lately been at home who goes second mate, after being common sailor for five years - he receives 25 per month now, and expects to be able to get a captain's birth soon. He says no one can expect to go as mater or mate till after going before the mast at least five years, but enough of sailor business, in which I conclude you do not take much interest now: I want you should write me one of your real particular letters, giving a faithful and detailed account of your situation, pursuits and especially the employment of your time out of school I hope you do not pay away your money and spend your time in that foolery which may be properly called acting out the boys - you perceive I am thinking of some scenes and incidents which I have witnessed in time past when you three boys have been together, at home, but I trust your minds are occupied with useful things now.\nThere is very little of interest going on here now, Mr. Bradbourne\nWritten up right side:\nThis is not such such a letter as I would gladly have written if I had had time to arrange my thoughts better but such as it is accept it and send an answer to your affectionate sister \nE. Ann \nUp the other side:\nBoys I hope you maintain social prayer among yourselves.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94466,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94466","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c504488b98b8e6f7b176809c8ddd86d1.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c504488b98b8e6f7b176809c8ddd86d1.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c504488b98b8e6f7b176809c8ddd86d1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c504488b98b8e6f7b176809c8ddd86d1.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:51:52+00:00","modified":"2020-10-19T20:26:52+00:00","filename":"c504488b98b8e6f7b176809c8ddd86d1.jpg","authentication":"d1803f9d67ba33cf1ef0880edfc57a2e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_11_002_003_o2.jpg","size":1557039,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2932,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04917130892830100241663870974662131629884243011474609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002246"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002246"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002246"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c504488b98b8e6f7b176809c8ddd86d1.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649019,"FileSize":1557039,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2932\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2932,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:34:43","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:22:46","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:22:46","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":87,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3186,"ExifImageLength":3911,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"on Anti-Slavery lectures from Rhode Island who is by some called a shrewd, smart man and by others a blackguard, has been lectureing almost every night this fortnight and Mr Walker likes him much; the liberty party have had quite a triumph having prevented any choice of representatives five times; my school room, being a ward room, was a place for voting so that I and my scholars were turned out liberty men for the day, every time they voted. Mr. J. K. Whipple - the veritable man spent a week in Bangor about a month ago. I saw him in our Sabbath School, but before I could speak to him he was gone, he looks in much better health than I ever before saw him; his residence at New Orleans has been beneficial to him I suppose. Have you engaged a school yet or do you expect to? and how long are you and Isaac intending to stay there? I am truly glad you are going to have such a good minister as Mr. Parker, I hope you will all profit much by the privileges you enjoy. I depend upon a letter from you and the other boys by this opportunity, you can certainly find time because your school of course will not keep Installation day, and you can have time to write me a good long letter besides attending meeting. Why do you not attend writing school? \n\n  Dear brother Eliab I have used up as you see most all my paper and as you may have reason to think, exhausted most all my store of ideas, but I will just say that I want to know how you get along with your studies, how you like the school and what improvement you are making write me an account of yourself, what you are studying, whether you write compositions, how often you attend to writing, how far from the academy you board etc. etc. My school is tolerably pleasant, about 50 in number we have had extremely pleasant weather here all the fall which is quite favorable for me, - Some persons here are almost running stark mad after Miller doctrines. One of the students has been dismissed from the Seminary and account of his extravagant conduct: A Mrs. Marden whom all national people think is deranged, holds Miller meeting every even at her house, confidently affirming that next Awk. will be the end of the world. \n\n[left side see previous page]","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94467,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94467","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b5671a9158ecc00e169f7c6ca179aee8.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b5671a9158ecc00e169f7c6ca179aee8.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b5671a9158ecc00e169f7c6ca179aee8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b5671a9158ecc00e169f7c6ca179aee8.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:51:54+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:48:25+00:00","filename":"b5671a9158ecc00e169f7c6ca179aee8.jpg","authentication":"59549af278f6be0bd8c5a76957670d9d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_11_002_004_o2.jpg","size":1141555,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2899,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.03646068887100299693582172722017276100814342498779296875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002250"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002250"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002250"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b5671a9158ecc00e169f7c6ca179aee8.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649020,"FileSize":1141555,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2899\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2899,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:34:45","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:22:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:22:50","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":58,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3112,"ExifImageLength":3864,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Miss E.A.

There have been fifty scholars in the academy this summer, Miss Cavenne is coming back this fall; Rebecca & Flora Tower are at home now, have been in Boston two years past, in a cap factory, expect to return again before winter. Why would not some such plan do for Lucy? To take a school of small scholars in Woonsocket for instance, and enjoy the advantages that city life offers; -- by they way why do'nt you write to Uncle Pel. and see if he cannot get you a chance there, to take a private or public school as soon as your fall term closes? It would do no harm to write, and might do good.  I intend to take a journey to Boston in two or three weeks, be there at the examinations and try to get a situation in the public schools there, -- if I find no chance in Bangor, -- perhaps take a small private school in Boston if practicable, until I can by dint of perseverance and importunity obtain a chance in the public school, which most probably I could do after a time. I shall first however see what can be done at Bangor; shall stop there two or three days on my way fro that purpose. Mary some expects to go to Portland, when I go to B. to meet her mother who stops at the springs longer than she intended at first, if she does, I shall start in a fortnight.

I do'nt know but we have written to you that we have one chamber all finished but plastering and painting; Charles hoped to have been able to do it and paint the front outside front entry and portico before haying but was unable to 'get time,' and it will not be done until late in the fall.

be better to hire money if we could than that you should leave next term the oxen are gaining weekly now and I think if he can get them Beef it would be better to sell them and buy another and cheaper on credit to put on the farm than to have money C's health is not near as good as it us'd to be he has a lame shoulder most all the time so that he can only sleep on one side- he has abused himself by hard work- we have had rain rain, rain almost every day this three weeks and now the hay needs to be all cut at once I am afraid a great deal will be wanted for the want of labor to get it our Grass is after all very stout and good if it could only be got in now all in a week or

Jan. 3d 1846\nDear Brother\nI wish you a happy new year.- I have begun a letter to you, two or three times and thought I would begin one a great many more times, but still your last kind letter remains unanswered. I will not take up time and spare in telling the seasons of my neglect but redeem my past negligence as well as I can, by writing all I can think of that will interest you. Joseph's health is pretty good now, but it would be better if he would come down from his elevation, occasionally, and find amusement, though it were in triffles: there is too much sameness in his life he has too little variety, nothing to give versatility enough, to his subjects of thought, and pursuits, to render his mind buoyant:- he very seldom hears a lecture in the evening, and has not made a social call or visit since he has been here: he went to Uncle Natty's one evening to bargain with him about the land for my (i.e.) his schoolhouse, but that is the most like a social call that he has done: I mean to make him if possible go with me and spend an evening at Mrs. Brown's soon, I have bought some Battledores almost on purpose to have him exercise in playing it with me, but he seldom does: he is however liked by his roommate Mr. Weld, and by the way: they say of him, 'where he does give a joke, it is worth something' and, 'though he do'nt say much, when he does speak it is something worth hearing:' I take some credit to myself for his being liked, for without me to help him along, he would not be understood;- I do'nt think he was at all at Browns.-\nHe has built me a schoolhouse since last Nov. all completed and paid for. I have been keeping in it, about a week have 35 scholars: 5 of them at $3,00 per quar., the rest at $2,00: Joseph agreed with the men to wait for part of pay till next summer, but they (the joiners) were in want of money, and made a discount to have the pay now and he has been able to do it, by taking up wages in advance, and by means of a note against Brown he received past payment from Charles.

I was hoping you would write, though I knew I did now deserve one, as I had not answered your last except by a few words in mother's when at Milo. I meant to have written you while there, but we all had too much talking to do to allow time for much else. I thought then that I should write you two or three letters by this time for strange as it may appear from my practice - I do really like to write especially to own folk's. \n\n I am ashamed of the plea of want of time, & it certainly is not want of inclination, so I do not know why I have not written oftener unless it be chargable upon the old 'thief of time' procrastination.

I am very glad of your good prospects there, it is another proof of how much reason you have to trust Providence that your way will be made plain, nay smooth before you if the language of your heart is, 'What wilt thou have me to do?' - I think you are favored in respect to boarding place to judge from the one of the family I have seen. I have a high opinion of Josephine Hall, though not much acquainted with her, have met her a few times: there is a dignity in her looks and appearance, rather uncommon; you have reason to think yourself flattered in resembling her in looks; her engagement must be recent as I heard nothing about it when she was here. She frequently spends a long time here I believe. As to Abby Bartlett, though not an intimate friend, nor indeed a calling acquaintance, I frequently meet her and feel somewhat acquainted. She is a very well-meaning and estimable person, though not to me at all prepossessing in manners & appearance: I had a right good visit from Lucy: she was here","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94496,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94496","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c6a72f8c24d19c8f8c63d77a21a1ea9d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c6a72f8c24d19c8f8c63d77a21a1ea9d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c6a72f8c24d19c8f8c63d77a21a1ea9d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c6a72f8c24d19c8f8c63d77a21a1ea9d.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:52:34+00:00","modified":"2020-10-19T21:39:12+00:00","filename":"c6a72f8c24d19c8f8c63d77a21a1ea9d.jpg","authentication":"10ea71e23f55512d6ae99157e04aff10","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_12_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1495256,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2952,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04690028103984700269535323968739248812198638916015625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002723"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002723"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002723"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c6a72f8c24d19c8f8c63d77a21a1ea9d.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649021,"FileSize":1495256,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2952\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2952,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:35:49","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:27:23","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:27:23","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3198,"ExifImageLength":3899,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"a little more than a fortnight: when she came, she did intend to stay a part of the time at Jos's boarding house, but we concluded she had best stay with me: Mrs. Palmer was very polite and kind, asked her to stay a week longer, said her daughter might visit her at Milo next summer so I conclude she do'nt intend to take pay for board. She went into school with me most every day: helped me some, and spent her time partly in drawing for which she has really talent as well as taste. If money was more plenty it would a fine plan for her to spend the ensuing  winter here: she could benefit me essentially in school, perfect herself in drawing and French, and especially she needs the ease and polish of manner, acquired by living much in good society: we have all from oldest to youngest stood in our own light by not mingling more in society that we have done, & it has been, in a degree, our own fault, in part at least, owing to the indomitable pride of our family which will not suffer us to make advances for fear we should not be met half way. I believe you are not so bad as some of the rest of us. Lucy did not visit bu twice, though she made some other calls. Mrs. Walter Brown owed her some attention on account of Eliab but their house is undergoing repairs so she was no in a situation to have company, therefore I excuse her, I do'nt feel satisfied with Sarah Harlow's treatment of Lucy. When there has been so much intimacy: she did not call on her either last winter or now though I told her she was here & how long she was to stay. I have not the least idea there was any intentional slight bu only culpable carelessness, just such as our folds have been guilty of many a time. Lucy & I tried pretty hard to get Eliab to carry to Mount Hope some day while she was here but there was no time when he could go himself when Mr. B's horse could be had; at least so he judged,  & he was a better judge than we, thought it did seem but reasonable that he should devote two or three hours to his sister when she comes so seldom.

Mr. P. is just as social and jolly as ever, has I think, an additional ease and elegance of manner and is rather more robust and hardy in appearance which is all the change I can discover in him.\nHe described to us an Arab dinner to which he was invited with two or three other guests: he accepted the invitation on condition that the visit should be conducted strictly according to their customs. He arrived before the others and was conducted into a carpetted  room of moderate size but very high to secure coolness: no chairs, but a low cushioned seat running all round the room about or less than a foot from the floor with cushions at the back so that one would recline rather than sit: soon after he was seated there servants came in one with something resembling a coffee pot, full of water - another with an empty vessel or tray, a third with towels: they think it an abomination to dip their hands in a dish and wash as we do but it must be running water to carry off all the filth; their habits are far removed from neatness in some other respects. - next servants brought in a censer with some aromatic gum burning, placed it before him & wrapped him in a large sheet to start he might inhale the incense; after this the mistress of the house appeared with a bottle of strong scented rose water - which she sprinkled very plentifully all over him; lastly the master of the house came seated himself near him & began a strain of compliments such as \"I take the greatest delight in your company,\" \"I feel greatly honoured that you are my guest\" \"This room & this house is lightened by your presence\" &c.\nThe dinner itself occupied an hour three small round tables about six inches from the floor at which he sat with feet doubled under him.

We have had much rainy weather here lately and nature is in her loveliest attire we have however taken no walks since our interesting and romantic excursion down the banks of the Kenduskeag: except that I took a walk to the Seminary a day or two since with Lizzie Doe & a young belle from Frankfurt: Have you ever visited the 'Institution' and explored its wonders? We went into the library which is really quite a room, at least to my eye, with quite a cabinet of curiosities specimens of heathen ingenuity, idols, or enough to fill one small room. Lucy was not smart enough to go that day, which was a pity, for we could not put it off: her health is certainly improving the effect I think in part of Dr. McRuen's medicine which she ought to have taken long ago. I have just read Lucy's epistle and she seems to have said all there is to tell you:- her 'Sam's book' that he brought for her to read the very day it got to town is very engaging.\nTruly I never before so forcibly felt the superiority of those noble souls and lofty intellects lodged in iron frames, who accomplished so much in the revolutionary struggle; & against such molds?; it seems to me the proportion of such men is small now. Probably the circumstances of the times in which they lived helped to make them what they were. Another thought struck me,- the resolution shown by the soldiers in enduring such privations, and extraordinary sufferings- for months without any covering but tufts of moss, and repeatedly fighting in this condition.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94504,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94504","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/62ad1d3950d66a4e6ec9948efcf2b01c.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/62ad1d3950d66a4e6ec9948efcf2b01c.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/62ad1d3950d66a4e6ec9948efcf2b01c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/62ad1d3950d66a4e6ec9948efcf2b01c.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:52:46+00:00","modified":"2020-10-19T21:47:57+00:00","filename":"62ad1d3950d66a4e6ec9948efcf2b01c.jpg","authentication":"3d8af82e7e1ace54e563b0630067c11c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_13_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1642858,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2942,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0517051262683489998295272016548551619052886962890625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002838"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002838"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002838"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"62ad1d3950d66a4e6ec9948efcf2b01c.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649022,"FileSize":1642858,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2942\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2942,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:36:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:28:38","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:28:38","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3165,"ExifImageLength":3872,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Your shirts are at last accomplished though it has been rather a lingering job, I hope they will fit well, we ought to have taken your measure especially for the collar and bosoms.

After the ride, Eliab & I determined upon a sail up the view, and not being able to any one to join us, we went alone in Uncle Henry's boat: we had an enjoyment in paddling along under the overhanging bushes, hearing the birds sing amidst the solitude and silence: we went up Baober brook half way to the new road Eliab said, we returned in time for dinner which we ate with fine relish, our dessert was each a saucer full of strawberries & cream. We started for Bangor about three, got in at nine, just as a few attempts were made at fireworks,- they never make out any thing here at that; too expensive perhaps, Since then I have been to Glenbarn with 6 or 7 others to sail over Pushaw, went to Lizzie Doe's father's to tea and had a delightful time._\nLast week the weather was extremely hot; very pleasant this week since Tues. when we had a more sever thunder storm than is usual here, but no injury done that I know of. Yesterday S. W. Furber carried Mehitable up to Milo; she came in the boat, the day before: I suppose","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94506,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94506","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/cf87eae3d069e114dca224d5a08357c9.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/cf87eae3d069e114dca224d5a08357c9.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/cf87eae3d069e114dca224d5a08357c9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cf87eae3d069e114dca224d5a08357c9.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:52:49+00:00","modified":"2020-10-19T21:52:09+00:00","filename":"cf87eae3d069e114dca224d5a08357c9.jpg","authentication":"943560f35fecb0b496f9e249ae77ac2b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_13_001_004_o2.jpg","size":1729606,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2899,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0552427401530539985419210324835148639976978302001953125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002849"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002849"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002849"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cf87eae3d069e114dca224d5a08357c9.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649022,"FileSize":1729606,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2899\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2899,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:36:13","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:28:49","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:28:49","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":64,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3145,"ExifImageLength":3905,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"there is a compact made now, and I feel rather sad about it, fear his happiness will not be increased by it, indeed I do'nt think she herself expects it yet I suppose it is, all things considered, best.\n\nJoseph has probably written you about this 'settlement'  I hope that is for the best, but do'nt know.

I would much rather you would go the west, and spend your days in endeavoring to stem the encroachments of property than to be an engineer.

I wish Joseph was as favourably situated for the health of his mind. Eliab seems to have a natural rebound of the spirit which counteracts care, or perhaps he is rather too young to be influenced much by it but Joseph needs such a life as you are leading, or a voyage to S. Arbor W. J. to give freedom of mind and healthful action,\nI should not look upon it at all as a misfortune,- in the end- if he should fail in his present effort in business, for it might be the means used by a kind Providence to lead him into circumstances to promote a more free, happy and harmonious action of the powers God has given him,- at present cramped, and in a measure turned from their nature bias: I know him to possess a keen susceptibility to enjoyment, but he seems now to allow himself none. Eliab returned yesterday from a week's sojourn at Milo, the particulars of which you will hear I suppose from them. Lucy as I judge, is in good health and spirits.\nI am going to have a week's vacation at Thanksgiving and if I could jump into a railroad car and reach home in an hour I should be glad: as it is do not think best to be at the trouble and expense to go, for so short stay. My school is flourishing an average of about 35 scholars. I board at Mr. Shepherds yet & probably shall, the winter; Lizzie Doe and I 'do', as usual; she sends her regards.

to her: she was then not 18,- the time when the world and its vanities have most power over the mind, she does not regard herself as having been pious then yet her noble regard to principle, led her to give up the good opinion of her friend, expose herself to obloquy and neglect. I will relate something of her at a still earlier period of life: After the death of her mother, (who you know was mother's oldest sister, whom I remember perfectly & with much affection). I visited at her fathers, & spent several days: she was then 15 or 16, the oldest of seven children, I spent the sabbath there and after tea, she gathered all the children together into a retired chamber, had us all kneel round the bed, while she led in prayer: this as I knew, had been Aunt's practice, and this good girl, putting away all false shame, simply to do her duty, had kept up the practice ever since her mother's death. Is there not something uncommon in such a character?\nAs I have gone so far, I will tell a little more of her history: A little previous to her mother's death, while on a visit to her relations in Barre, she became acquainted with a young man of that place by the name of Lee, he belonged to one of the very first families, was wealth & moved in a high circle, he was much pleased with her, for she was interesting in her appearance; he visited her after her return home, and it resulted in an engagement: after awhile some of the relations from Athol who knew all about him, sent word that he was dissipated somewhat, in his habits: she dismissed him at once, though I have no doubt at a great sacrifice to her own feelings: I can not help thinking that if it had not been for this early blighting of her affections and hopes, she would not have united her destiny with that old lunks of a Dickinson twine her age: I believe that she set her own feelings aside, and married because of her father's narrow circumstances there, the necessities of her younger sisters, and her need of a home. When I was there three years ago, she said to me, with much emphasis, 'do'nt you marry for a home'.\nI am sorry to hear that Joseph A. is a follower of Parker, but Unitarianism lends to infidelity, and it is not strange: I cannot but hope that Uncle Joseph & aunt are real christians; they have been grounded in the truth in infamy though their children have only been under Unitarian influence.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94514,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94514","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e40be447edbf106142ac9ce1bf2e7afa.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e40be447edbf106142ac9ce1bf2e7afa.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e40be447edbf106142ac9ce1bf2e7afa.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e40be447edbf106142ac9ce1bf2e7afa.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:53:00+00:00","modified":"2020-10-19T22:01:26+00:00","filename":"e40be447edbf106142ac9ce1bf2e7afa.jpg","authentication":"e00d570b512f6379af19b88345c4f59c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_13_004_004_o2.jpg","size":1681877,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2897,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0537553855201420016651780997563037090003490447998046875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002948"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002948"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["002948"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e40be447edbf106142ac9ce1bf2e7afa.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649022,"FileSize":1681877,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2897\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2897,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:36:29","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:29:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:29:48","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3167,"ExifImageLength":3935,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"You have never mentioned Maria Stevens in any of your letters, whether she is at home or not, and how you like her.- cousin Lucy Williams looks very much indeed, or Ardelia did at her age, though hardly so handsome.\n\n       The chief subject of interest at present in Bangor is the Lyceum, which just now occasions much talk.

I think you are formed to enjoy social intercourse and to be made better as well as more useful to others by it, and who is not? if your brother Joseph would commune with his fellow beings, open the stores of his accurately well-filled mind, impart and diffuse the just sentiment and kind feelings of his heart, if he could easily and gracefully act upon other minds with his strong, common sense and moral worth how much good might he accomplish, and how much enjoyment he would receive in return! Constituted as he is, there must be a void felt by him a lack of communion with other minds for I know he is formed to enjoy it with kindred spirits;\nDo you stand erect nowadays?

In his first, he said that there is here a 'clique of men who are trying to bring in, pour in, sift in, thrust in, as much infidelity  upon this  community as they cleverly care'. He changed it when the managers of the Lyceum, from information from one not connected with any Orthodox society ' who had sagacity enough to see what was in the wind', - he was understood to implicate the meeting for chair of managers, consisting of Gov.

I wish cousin Joseph could see just what he is admiring in Mr Parker. Mr Pomroy reviewed Mr Parker's lecture before the the Lyceum, in which he manifestly cast contempt upon all religion or rather all faith in anything particular or necessary to salvation, said the press had been recreant to duty in not condemning such sentiment, said he \"if I should go before the Lyceum and speak against Universalism as I solemnly believe, would nothing be said? From which of the four mountains of Moab should I not be cursed'_ this last expression four mountains of Moab, called forth \"Asa\", ise, as it clasped him with the rest, Bill Bartlett\u00a0; Haines, etc. where in fact he had placed himself by most upholding the truth. The third lecture was upon the infidelity of Fouvievism.

Quite unawares, Slipped up stairs: it was a joyful surprise as you may think:- the next afternoon (Wednes), I was at liberty, and we shopped- spent 15 or 16 dolls. bought her a pretty wedding dress (silk) for which Eliab furnished means the day after she had a dressmaker and nearly completed making her dress: the next day she spent at Mrs. Thaxter's (where she said she staid last winter.) and the next day went home. a much shorter visit than I expected or she intended, but Mother was not willing she should stay longer because Charles was away from home, and the state of things lonely, at home. I presume I could not write you any news from Milo for I suppose you hear pretty often and as particularly as I do, Lucy found a new comer to welcome, when she returned, which in a bit of letter i had from her to day,- she describes as a 'homely little imp' crying all the time; a truly favorably account since homely babies make handsome men, and the exercise of its vocal organs only proves its strength of lungs.

Do you recollect a year ago when we all kept fast day in my chamber, you were down from your school at Stillwater, Lucy was here, and the boys, and we had quite a merry time considering the day. If you were here to day, you would see me in a loose morning dress, and shawl, - half sick; a large blister drawn on my left arm, to relieve some invitation and pain in my head which has shown itself by ulcer in the ear, and which I think is caused by defective teeth: having a day's respite from school, I improved the opportunity to apply this remedy through in consequence, have been obliged to deny myself the pleasure of hearing \nDr. Pomroy's sermon to day, upon  The Sins of Bangor, he mentioned the subject of discourse last sabbath; his church was crowded even to the aisles, and the sermon excellent, very plain powerful and calculated to do much good. I judge from Lissie's report: Prof. Shepard has recently preached, and repeated by earnest request, a fine sermon to young men on 'Bad Company'.\nA few evenings after I received your last, Miss Doe and I by special invitation of Josephine Hall, spent a very pleasant social eve, at her Aunt's Mrs. Veasie's. We met there her 'friend,' Mr. Morse, with whom I had quite a little chat, and like him; there were five or six students among whom were Mason Snow & Goodrich that you know: White, who boards there, and who mentioned seeing you last fall, is I think really interesting, nothing perhaps great about him, but he is so social, easy, natural and pleasant in conversation, yet without descending in the least to small talk, that one cannot but enjoy his society: he told me his mother and sisters are members of Pine St. church. Boston, Abby Bartlett was there and enquired for you, also Angella Dennett was there who has made up again with Everett,and will probably soon marry him. Josephine told me, when I wrote you, to give her love to you, to send merely her regards, she said it was too cold, and common place. There is something that I like much in Miss Hall, something earnest and truthful in her soul-speaking eye.

What is the reason you do not write such letters to your brother Eliab? he would appreciate them, and he feels the difference you make between him and Joseph in your correspondence.

pervading it - Mr. H. is the parson of the Presbyterian church - the largest congregation in the 'city;' when he came three years ago, there was no school in the place, conducted on religious principles, and his wife, being a teacher of some celebrity was solicited by some pious parents to open a school, which she did as a means of usefulness and much good has already resulted, though she has had difficulties to encounter and opposition from the irreligious, but has now a flourishing female school of more than sixty, mostly young ladies: I am the 'assistant,' but she takes the juvenile

The style of preaching here is much more animated than in old places, and the congregation far more alert and attentive: the style of Mr. H. seems really piquant but calculated to do good and keep the attention, he has very good talent and appears to be a very good man, he has a fine library which I shall take much pleasure in improving.\nMrs. Hopkins is quite as earnest, quick, and straight ahead, as your sister Anne, and just about as frank and openhearted, with perhaps a little more prudence; so I think we shall get along pretty well together.

I received a good letter from cousin Maria, in which she mentions your having been sick you mentioned feeling ill in yours; Do be careful I have a sort of prevailing feeling of anxiety about you from my conviction that you are too regardless or rather you presume too much or your general good health expose yourself too much or over task your strength. I wish your business would be here, while I stay here. I sometimes feel rather lonely have not got acquainted so as to feel real companionship with any: the family are kind, every thing pleasanter than I expected but no particular congeniality. Mr. H. is quite a story teller a kind hearted man, very pleasant in his family - in respect to his mind there is perhaps a defect, in respect to that faculty which Mr. Clach of Hartford calls the foundation of mental character: viz. the imagination, upon which he gave us a find lecture: he calls it the  mission of the mind, reflecting its ideas - the canvass on which its impressions are delineated: he considers essential to a properly cultivated imagination; yet to clear away the fog - to see clearly the picture presented to the mind's eye, - to see it in just proportion the filling up as well as the outline, in other words, a delicate perception - To be able to retain its picture before the mind as long as it is wanted - to see us unreal images: it is the last that seems on some degree attributable to Mr. H. Is there not much truth in this idea of the importance of the imagination? The part of Racine in which we are, is the most elevated & pleasantest, and here the water is good, in the lower portions of the place it is not. As to railroads, there is one in Progress I believe southwest from Chicago, but I hear no talk about it. Plank roads are thought better, uniting the necessities of the country around, which is, as you are aware a great wheat and corn country: it is thought that plank roads better facilitate transportation and trade, on which the prosperity of these lake ports depend, - that railroads would do. they can be built at the cost of 1500. per mile & last ten years, ten miles of one, has been completed west from Chicago, and that yield a profit of 80 per cent to the stock holders.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94551,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94551","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8517a341012cc88e0fc6638bd8b602b6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8517a341012cc88e0fc6638bd8b602b6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8517a341012cc88e0fc6638bd8b602b6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8517a341012cc88e0fc6638bd8b602b6.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:53:52+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:48:25+00:00","filename":"8517a341012cc88e0fc6638bd8b602b6.jpg","authentication":"86b56048cad5f9c52c7b797a9efea3c4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_15_001_005_o2.jpg","size":1328275,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3600,"resolution_y":2386,"compression_ratio":0.05154586166216500175973891373359947465360164642333984375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["003533"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["003533"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["003533"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8517a341012cc88e0fc6638bd8b602b6.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649024,"FileSize":1328275,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3600\" height=\"2386\"","Height":2386,"Width":3600,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:37:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:35:33","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:35:33","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3347,"ExifImageLength":2219,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"all get rich in buying wheat and shipping it to Buffalo. half a million bushels were shipped last year from this port. from eight to ten thousand bushels come in on teams daily in good travelling.

Chicago has suffered from a freshet recently. The great quantity of snow made the streams very high and the city, - in no port above five feet higher than the lake, - has been covered with with water through not of much depth. The ice dammed up the small river that empties in there, a vessel was loosed from anchorage, went with such force as to capsize another vessel, and some lives were lost. I am told that in an port of Chicago, three feet below the surface, water is found; below the water, is a solid bed of clay: in some places holes are found without any bottom - not a very pleasant place of residence methinks, but a great centre for business.

It seems, land was given by Virginia for school funds, a mile square for each towship of six miles square, - the middle section, as it lies, whether in a swamp or in a lake - one third here is in the lake, and the whole a Southport 10 miles from here,) Now the wise Legislation of the State has take this fund into their own hand so apportions out to the different towns; - the school section here is the finest and best part of the city, has been taken up in lots by people who have improved them by buildings, gardens, &c. paying a small yearly tax, these lots have the past winter been valued by commissioners, professedly without reference to improvements, at the round sum of one hundred thousand dolls. Mr. H's two lots for house and school in all 1\/2 acre at $8.25.  The owners refuse to pay, can put it off in court several years - in consequence, there is no school money and none but private schools. The cedars are 'bonafide' red cedars the tallest kind of tree, good for ports & shipbuilding but not for shingles - The oak openings look just like an old New Eng, orchard, only larger trees. - this place was covered with dense forest of birch and other kinds as well as oaks. The want of timbered land is a general characteristic of the country bank, though as yet probably enough is found for necessary purposes: doubtless a disadvantage, but counterbalance by the greater fertility of the soil, which yields abundant crops of wheat after having been exhausted by crops of corn several years, I have forgotten the amount to the size but two men will, with a reaping machine worked with horses - reap twenty acres in a day - these farmers can sell for cash - .50 pr bushel is less than the usual price. - wheat enough to buy all the fuel and every thing else they need.

The view of the prairie is delightful as far as the eye could search,was a gently undulating plain, with here and there clumps of trees;  neat cottages scattered all over it, with fields enclosed of grain or grass beautifully green  the first fresh robe of spring.  We turned off on a bye road crossing the prairie in another direction, but bringing us back to the main road; this road was never made or repaired simply a carriage path over the prairie, but as smooth and hard as a [unclear] road, almost level, not a rock, stone nor even a pebble to be seen, but a fine black loam;  we saw several fine gardens; the soil is so rich as to require very little labour to cultivate; we gathered a large bouquet of wild flowers growing in a field beside the road.  some splendid kinds that I had never before seen saw some new species of birds too, one with plumage brilliant red;  So much for my excursion it is the first time I have been out far enough to see the prairie;  it is entirely settled a great deal of wheat is raised; It is said that wheat enough will be raised in Wisconsin this year to supply the entire country if none should be raised elsewhere.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94568,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94568","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/72a9abc852cf4905a13c7c2a7983025d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/72a9abc852cf4905a13c7c2a7983025d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/72a9abc852cf4905a13c7c2a7983025d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/72a9abc852cf4905a13c7c2a7983025d.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:54:15+00:00","modified":"2020-10-20T22:42:38+00:00","filename":"72a9abc852cf4905a13c7c2a7983025d.jpg","authentication":"4d5b52c1b479b18db0d4b83d4dd4540a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_15_004_006_o2.jpg","size":1486385,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2781,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04948875970540800306451956203090958297252655029296875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["003757"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["003757"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["003757"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"72a9abc852cf4905a13c7c2a7983025d.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649025,"FileSize":1486385,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2781\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2781,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:38:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:37:57","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:37:57","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":9,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3199,"ExifImageLength":4141,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The Plank has been made 7 or 8 miles out;

One of the teachers who came with me last fall, a fine young lady from Fitchburg Mass. is located at Wawatosa five miles west of Milwaukee,  She came and spent a few days with me then I returned home with her.  The trip on the lake was most delightful  we started about three oclock on the Niagara one of the floating palaces ' of the west';  arrived at M. at 5  25 miles,  expected a man to carry us to Wawatosa but were disappointed he having heard the boat was not expected should have had to pass the night at hotel, had not an old neighbour of my friends from Mass. chanced to come to the same house he offered to carry us and accordingly a handsome carriage was out the door at sunset and we had a fine moonlight ride of five miles on a plank road by the side of Menominee river.  The gentleman would receive no pay though it must have been a dollar or two expense;  he had traveled much in the west for several years and such acts of generous politeness though rather uncommon I imagine, in the massive valley of old Mass.  are quite characteristic of the open liberality of Western character.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94575,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94575","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/cac8fe0629c17808d8d352ea91aea0e3.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/cac8fe0629c17808d8d352ea91aea0e3.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/cac8fe0629c17808d8d352ea91aea0e3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cac8fe0629c17808d8d352ea91aea0e3.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:54:25+00:00","modified":"2020-10-20T22:52:24+00:00","filename":"cac8fe0629c17808d8d352ea91aea0e3.jpg","authentication":"d609a4634a5fc7e1265a32a5ef4997f8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_15_006_003_o2.jpg","size":1332064,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2860,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0431256151256149966588537836287287063896656036376953125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["003841"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["003841"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["003841"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cac8fe0629c17808d8d352ea91aea0e3.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649025,"FileSize":1332064,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2860\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2860,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:38:43","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:38:41","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:38:41","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3226,"ExifImageLength":4060,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Business is now very lively here;  the wheat begins to pour in, the merchants are busy buying and shipping it.  I saw a notice from a Buffalo paper lately that there came on the upper lakes to that city between one noon and the next, 17 steamboats and 70 Schooners with half a million bushels of grain.  One man not two writes from here has one enclosed field of wheat containing 160 acres.  It is reaped by a machine worked by horses on the trot reaping from 15 to 20 acres in a day.  In Michigan, as I was informed by a clergyman from there who preached here a week ago, they have a machine which at once reaps, thatches,and puts the wheat into bags!  these last are I suppose attached to the machine and taken off as fast as filled.  There is much rivalry between the boats of the upper lakes and the railroad company through Michigan, by the latter route, one can go from here to Buffalo in 34 hours, fare five dollars.  A gentleman living next door but one to us, has just returned from New York; he transacted his business in that city and was at home again in just 4 hours less, than six days, from the time he started.  What think you of that?  \nThe census of this place has been recently taken showing not quite 4000 inhabitants;  there are 15 or 16 physicians though the place has always been distressingly healthy, an equal number of lawyers I presume though I have not heard their number mentioned.  There is no decent school for boys only one that I know of and that taught by a Dutchman not quite so tall as I am.  The only school for girls of any importance is the Seminary under the care of Mrs. Rev T.M Hopkins and her assistant, lately procured from 'the east' , Miss Rich who has the name of being a very good teacher.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94576,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94576","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/489e1bf8a5c65b352427318bd2d4f4a2.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/489e1bf8a5c65b352427318bd2d4f4a2.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/489e1bf8a5c65b352427318bd2d4f4a2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/489e1bf8a5c65b352427318bd2d4f4a2.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:54:26+00:00","modified":"2020-10-20T22:54:47+00:00","filename":"489e1bf8a5c65b352427318bd2d4f4a2.jpg","authentication":"e9bd3d17d900775d6c994563968eb0df","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_15_006_004_o2.jpg","size":1312714,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2810,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.043255371029391996573476575349559425376355648040771484375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["003904"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["003904"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180530"],"TimeCreated":["003904"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"489e1bf8a5c65b352427318bd2d4f4a2.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649025,"FileSize":1312714,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2810\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2810,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 11:38:45","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:30 00:39:04","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:30 00:39:04","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3138,"ExifImageLength":4020,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I was quite charmed with Wawatosa, it so much resembles Milo and towns about there. the same variety of surface, undulating not hilly just about as new in appearance settled by thriving New Englanders with farms already under fine cultivation.  \nFrom the window my eye ranged over broad fields of tall waving corn and still broader fields of wheat just being harvested.

How pleasant it must have been for you to be all together at Lucy's I am glad she has such a pleasant convenient house. she seems at present to have every thing she could desire in respect to her circumstances  May her spirit be. by Divine grace kept humble, tender and loving as it has in time past eminently been.  Outward ease and prosperity we have reason to think is a more trying ordeal for the human soul.  I do not want any of my brothers or sisters to be really sick, for I fear it would make them cold hearted and selfish. but I do wish our brother Charles was more easy in his circumstances and it seems as if he might be; he always seems to be struggling with obstacles, careworn, prevented by sordid care from acting out the better and happier impulses of his nature.\nAlmeda's letter informs me that Lucy has been anxious a long time, now indulges some hope and that Lizzy's attention is much upon the subject of religion.  there are revivals all around them  may Milo not be passed over; as Lucy says, it has been dark there a long time.  My health never was better than since I have been at the West;  I have some expectations that Providence has opened a path for in another direction, promising greater care & more pay but it is not certain yet that I can have the chance therefore will not write particulars. My Salary here, is $.130 per year besides board.  About 60 dolls are due me now besides the 50 I sent to Eliab.

He first represented the attractiveness as well as benefits of might, in our present state, its blessings and its teachings, 'unrolling the scroll of immensity'  then the glories and excellencies of that higher state, in which there shall be no need of cessation or repose because no weariness of mind or body  the spirit, in the vigor of youth, the freshness of morning, in ever delighted activity, exploring the illienitable fields of the universe, without sin, without doubts, without end!\nMy attempts to give the smallest idea of the sermon are cold and tame enough, but what a place will his gifted mind take when disencumbered from the clog of the body!  Our dear Joseph I think in the character of his mind, as well as in his eccentricities, bore a resemblance to Mr. Tinker.  a shrinking sensitiveness, combined with lofty, firm purpose, and fearless independence and even in little peculiarities I can trace a similarity.  \nDoes the thought ever come thrilling up to your mind, that our dear brother is a ministering spirit; perhaps has a mission to this world and to us, maybe, unseen, about our path when we wake and when we sleep?

now if they want me and are pretty unanimous in it I will take it for $200 per week, but not for less - or if there should be a fair prospect of a good private school for three or four months instead, I should like it better, they may try to do this if the district are unwilling to give me my price.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94638,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94638","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/cdb8b22ca9203aab7a9945be776df034.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/cdb8b22ca9203aab7a9945be776df034.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/cdb8b22ca9203aab7a9945be776df034.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cdb8b22ca9203aab7a9945be776df034.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:55:55+00:00","modified":"2020-10-21T20:38:50+00:00","filename":"cdb8b22ca9203aab7a9945be776df034.jpg","authentication":"1071a669617fade9b2abbf961b145802","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_18_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1214026,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2901,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0387486435073469970280513052784954197704792022705078125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["040543"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["040543"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["040543"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cdb8b22ca9203aab7a9945be776df034.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649029,"FileSize":1214026,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2901\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2901,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 16:36:51","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:31 04:05:43","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:31 04:05:43","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"SubSecTimeOriginal":92,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2885,"ExifImageLength":3579,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"but of course you will say nothing about that.- I suppose you will be at home next.

What has all this to do with aristocracy? Of this term scarce any two person have ideas in common: if it means holding ourselves above the 'common vulgar herd'; -- is it not right to seek to exceed the common standard in what constitutes true refinement of taste and manners, as well as in all that, which renders the soul alive to 'beauty' whether it be moral, intellectual or merely in relation to sensible objects and matters of taste? Is not the meaning generally attached to it nearly synonymous with pride? Man loves to maintain an imaginary superiority over his fellow, some fancied excellence, some advantage acquired by the possession of greater wealth. some consciousness of deeper research in to things than others, some whim of possessing superiour refinement of mind, or a more exact observation of outside forms, and such idle ceremony as the world deems politics. these things intoxicate the heads of the upper classes, who are apt to suppose that pride is their exclusive badge, distinguishing them from the vulgar. but in fact pride is a great leveller, - a livery worn by every drudge in Satan's extensive household.\" Of this kind of aristocracy, our family has perhaps an uncommon share, not confined to one member of the family, but taking its particular direction from the peculiar mental characteristics of each, and pretty fairly developed in all. Does it not lead you to a sort of exclusiveness, an unsocial, contemptuous feeling towards others? witness your expressions about vulgar, lowlived merchants it seems to me that it would be a great embellishment to your character if you would let your whole heart and soul flow out towards your kind, with the milk of human kindness, take an interest in others, for interesting traits and something to imitate maybe\n[left-hand side] With regards to the works of 'nater'- imagination lends fascination: if you were among them all the time you would now would only be thinking 'these potatoes are ready to hoe';

The middle section of six miles square is reckoned the sixteenth square mile. The Legislature have taken it into their hands to apportion, but prized this place enormously high, but have however been petitioned and made abatement of about one third, - the inhabitants have concluded to pay and the terms are these, one sensts to be paid each year and 7 percent interest reckoned previous to payment. As so the cedars they are but few, on the steep bank of the river very large, going to decay, the few bushes growing look just like those at Milo but the inroads made upon their precincts by men and boys will soon destroy them I fear. This place is quite a paradise for lawyers and physicians, particularly the latter; they will make money, and there is a host of them: - ministers do not thrive as well. Racine has five churches besides foreign, and has just sent off three of her ministers and there are a few disaffected who wish Mr. H. to leave: - whether he will I know not. Seriously I judge this must be a good place for lawyers: it is situated like Bangor in respect to commanding the business of the country around. I have become a little acquainted with one good one - Mr. Worden from Belfast Me. - has practised his profession several years at Cheraw S.C. previous to coming here. Come on here next Aug. and then if you like, you can stay and read law with him next winter, eh?\n I have no doubt you will derive real benefit from journeying therefore say I, go, and come, and spare not the filthy lucre.\n You can go from Bangor to Buffalo for less than twelve dolls. from Buffalo here the fare will not exceed six or eight, so you could come and return for about fifty dolls. I have written at you in my letter to mother which you may read and ponder and write me your cogitations. Is it not singular that there have been so many fire and shipreaks  of late and that New Orleans is sunk under water. There have been fifty deaths from cholera at Chicago, and eight at Southport a place ten miles south of this: none here as yet.

The young girl was very sick on the passage and had enormous doses of restorative given her, was reported\u00a0: to have the cholera so they were not permitted to land at Milwaukee as they wished because she seemed to be sinking so rapidly: they were humanely received at the 'Racine house' and every thing done for them: Mr. H. went to see them, liked their appearance much, in a few days the girl died, killed by medicine probably she had no physician here which probably provoked some of them, they were two boarding at the same public house - After her burial, two physicians, under the base pretext of having suspicions of her character, got by some means a legal warrant to make an examination, disinterred the body and dissected it in the night. Just after that, there was an event still more tragic. A young lady of good appearance came from Chicago, took a room at one of the hotels, soon began to be ill, became alarmingly so, physicians were called against her wishes: they charged her with having taken poison, which she reluctantly confessed: it was too late to save her; she had brought her shroud ready made, and fifty dolls to defray the expenses of a decent burial, not wishing she said to make any one any trouble.

A rich man who came here when all was new, had a field of wheat, one enclosure - of one hundred and sixty acres.\nReaping is done by a machine worked by horses on the trot, from fifteen to twenty acres in a day. In Michigan, as I was told by a clergyman from there, who preached here a week ago, they have a machine which at once, reaps, thrushes, and puts the wheat into bags. I enquired if the bags were tied up also, but he thought not; probably they are attached to the machine and taken off as fast as filled.

A lady from Vermont represents every thing as parched up, crops to a great extent cut off, in some instances fields of grain burned down into the ground from fires in the woods.\nThere have been frequent showers here during the season and the most delightful weather I ever in my life experienced, pure invigorating air, cool but mild breezes\n\nI have one \nThen the rest is cut off.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94652,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94652","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/736c4cb25387b0a09ade1e8752dd35cd.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/736c4cb25387b0a09ade1e8752dd35cd.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/736c4cb25387b0a09ade1e8752dd35cd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/736c4cb25387b0a09ade1e8752dd35cd.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:56:15+00:00","modified":"2020-10-22T22:46:41+00:00","filename":"736c4cb25387b0a09ade1e8752dd35cd.jpg","authentication":"4307ada04e208d4751e699a2f2bd7f44","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_18_005_008_o2.jpg","size":1354319,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2843,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0441083036958870022825607293270877562463283538818359375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["040805"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["040805"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["040805"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"736c4cb25387b0a09ade1e8752dd35cd.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649029,"FileSize":1354319,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2843\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2843,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 16:37:22","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:31 04:08:05","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:31 04:08:05","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2882,"ExifImageLength":3649,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Ann   Aug. 22. 1849.\nclear skies: vegetation looks beautifully now.

Had I better learn German if I can.\n We have in school two German girls whose father is rich and educated came a few months since from Germany they have been well instructed can cipher well, but cannot understand hardly a sentence in English. the father offers to give board to some one to teach them to talk English. I am going to enquire about it and perhaps....if the sour crout is cooked clean, and if I can learn German pun,  it might be worth while.

Y. instead of Buffalo as a hotel: - have been invited to do it by an acquaintance living there whose brother is going to Boston, so I should have company all the way from there; As soon as I ascertain what day I shall reach Boston, I will mail this, so that if you can possibly get away, you can jump on to the cars and meet me at Boston. I shall doubtless stop there a few days\n\nBradford via Newbury N.H.

Almeda's comb they will not take at all: if it was plain shell they would. - I will get you a dress like A's, in two or three weeks. Joseph has about making a trade with a painter to take a cow and paint the house but I suppose he will ask more for his job than ?page torn and C. will want more for his cows than for cash on hand, so between the two, it will be a bad bargain for me: Abby Foss is staying several weeks  at Prof. Pond's taking lessons of Mr. Headly a cousin of Mr. Mahby's and famous teacher of music: I called upon her yesterday: I have been at my new boarding place two day, like very well: my chamber is retired, with two large pleasant windows, but small, and have to go up the back stairs to get to it: have tried hard to get Joseph to leave the store early enough this eve, to walk with me to 'lover's leap' hope he will, but he is too incorrigible about taking relaxation. I mean to try to have some sort of a spree, and ride out of town to Pusham or somewhere 4 of Jul if I can make J. and E. go:","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94668,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94668","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/89b101c089d24790aa6e7b256919a8dd.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/89b101c089d24790aa6e7b256919a8dd.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/89b101c089d24790aa6e7b256919a8dd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/89b101c089d24790aa6e7b256919a8dd.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:56:37+00:00","modified":"2020-10-23T04:18:12+00:00","filename":"89b101c089d24790aa6e7b256919a8dd.jpg","authentication":"c57c2acca7ad158afd739d1e8351115d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_20_001_004_o2.jpg","size":1224430,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2794,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040577361541928001764656386285423650406301021575927734375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["041112"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["041112"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["041112"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"89b101c089d24790aa6e7b256919a8dd.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649030,"FileSize":1224430,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2794\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2794,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 16:38:03","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:31 04:11:12","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:31 04:11:12","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"SubSecTimeOriginal":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2781,"ExifImageLength":3582,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Joseph can much better afford to spend a little money once in awhile in riding than lose his health & with all power to enjoy any thing.\nA piece of my new dress - the thick stripes run up and down, which makes it strange\nE.A.Rich Bangor\n\n  June 7 '46\n                           Mr. C.W.

DeWitt\n\nElyria Ohio Jan 2d 1866\nMy Dear Aunt, I have sad news to write. Our dear mother, your sister, has left us. She was taken sick Saturday night Dec 23 and died this forenoon between nine and ten oclock. She suffered a good deal during nine days with severe cough and pain in the side but her end was entirely easy. Doctor called it Lung Fever and from the first gave little encouragement to hope for her recovery. Mother was indeed ripe for heaven and our so great loss we know is to her an exceeding great gain. While we sorrow for the lack of her society and her counsel here and her earthly love, we can but rejoice for her transition to glory. Mother spoke frequently of her \"Two Dear Sisters\" in old Warwick. You were evidently among her last thoughts. She has often wished to visit you once more. We have all been sorry she did not that last time she was in Maine. But it makes no difference now. You will soon meet where partings are no more forever.\n\n It had been great comfort to us, as it was great pleasure to Mother that my brothers are both here this winter. Charles you know moved out here with his family a year since, and now lives on his new farm, less than a mile out of the village from here. Eliab came out here with his whole family in October to spend the winter. And they could both, as well as sister Anna, be with Mother much of the time during her sickness. Mother has enjoyed very much having her grand children about her. Charles, Eliab and I, you know, have each five children here. The fifteen (or 16 including Lizzie DeWitt, Anna's youngest step-daughter. Hattie the elder was married last Spring) made quite a company of young folks and were a great pleasure to Mother. Mother's health has been very good in Ohio tho' we could see that her strength had failed some during the past year. Still she was in the frequent habit of walking between my house ad Anna's, about half a mile, and would have so the day she was taken sick if the walks had not been very slippery with ice. I wish we could see you and talk with you and tell you many things about Mother's last days. Perhaps we may sometime. Most sincerely your loving nephew Isaac J.

With regard to Lucy's dress, if it is actually too short, I am quite willing to change my winter plaid with her, if she has not spoilt that by cutting up one of the breadths: mine, she can certainly make long enough, by gaging it over, if not without, and, as I shall be obliged to use mine quite common it will not make much difference with me which I have.\n  If you conclude to change, send it down as soon as convenient, without doing anything to the skirt, as if you should attempt to make it for me, it might not be the right length; etc. I wish you would send Watts on ? word covered by removed stamp with Questions, if you have not. Eliab has some things for me, my workbox etc. that I have not yet been able to get, and that book may be among them.

I must give you an account of it.  Wednes Morn 6 1\/2 on the 11th, with satchels on our arms, we began our march out into the world (i.e.) we walked, 24 of us from the Orphan Asylum, our place of refuge in Hartford to the cars nearly a mile -- our baggage was carried the day previous;  at the cars we were joined by Gov. Slade and we were soon flying away from home and friends, ere long among the barren hills of Berkshire Co., then across the line, and we had left dear New Eng. behind; we passed in sight of Kinderhook residence of Van Burn-- over a gently rolling, pleasant looking country, with great heaps of apples under the trees, reached Albany at one oclock, crossed Hudson river by a ferry, and marched with Gov. Slade at our head to Delaware House, (only a rod or two) the best hotel in the city;  every thing in elegant style, two long tables, more that a hundred seated a score of black waiters, silver forks, --every variety of dishes for dessert, delicious pears, grapes, ice cream &c. our 'escort' had business in the city, so we staid to dinner and tea, & three or four of us rambled about to see the city, went into the State House, Senate chamber and Historical rooms where we saw fine pictures and statues.

one poor horse was dragging a large heavy laden boat slowly along; a little below the city, are the falls;  the water falls over a perpendicular, semicircular ledge, about 80 feet deep and the banks for some extent are nearly that height; on one bank is an open space where visitors go to see the falls: on the other, a long row of flour mills by water.

She has very agreeable manners, attracts much attention from Gentlemen has a perfect form and figure as I ever saw. She does not look old, is handsome. To her affair with Baldwin she does not allude, has not at all to her sisters; says she shall never marry. says there are few girls great enough to be old maids; she is fond of the society of gentlemen in a general, social way,  makes herself very agreeable, more natural easy and pretty than Lizzie Doe I think, seems to be a favourite, and her acquaintance seem to be of a good class. Of the three weeks I was there, but two evenings except Sundays, passed without calls and visits from gentlemen, alone or in company with ladies, or that we did not go out. We had two skiff rides up the Muskingum, by delightful moonlight, Lucy and I and two gentlemen- and two walks on neighbouring hills.

The peculiarities of talking of the Buckeyes, is rather amusing to an uninitiated ear: the children old and young instead of father say 'pop'! and the people all use 'like' for 'as', - 'you do'nt speak like we do' or - We must speak the words in singing like we do in talking' and so on  in all cases.

A young lady went from Westfield to Arkansas, got no letters from her friends in three months, while they heard regularly from her.

I must begin to turn my attentions towards school again. I dread next term: it will be much harder than the last: more scholars: I dread too commencing with the two new gentlemen teachers, I feel an insecurity about my situation, there is so much divided feeling and counterworking, interested management, as shown in the circumstances of Mr. Pilsbury's leaving. School commences next Wednes. Lucy's last letter was received just before I left Westfield: I want very much to hear again soon - hope there is a letter waiting for me at Westfield. I forgot to say that when I started for Zanesville. Mr. Rumsey went on board with me introduced me to the captain as a member of his family and in consequence I went 'dead-head' to Cleveland saving me $2.50 or 3.00: As Mr. Rumsey owns the dock his family go trips all access free. Coming back I had to take a boat to this place fifteen miles too far, and take another boat back, making it more expensive.

The farmers about here grown rich and they do so by raising cattle and sheep and making butter and cheese more than by the hard labor of tilling the ground and selling grain. I should suppose you might turn your farm more into pasture and either sell beef at Dover etc. or drive a 'drove' every fall to Bangor and take the money easier than to dig it out of the lands. I see not why you and Almeda too might not make it profitable to make cheese extensively it would require as little outgo as any thing and could be kept until it could be marketted. I see not why you cannot lay up money by farming so as to live easy, paint and finish your house, put on blinds etc. as well as the men here grow rich who have not according to my knowledge any facilities that might not be made available there though this is a good country I like Maine better especially the climate.

We have two vol. of Ecleatio's? bound pretty volumes","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":94699,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/94699","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/aac2de37bf39f5efbd3f0210204192d8.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/aac2de37bf39f5efbd3f0210204192d8.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/aac2de37bf39f5efbd3f0210204192d8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/aac2de37bf39f5efbd3f0210204192d8.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-11T23:57:18+00:00","modified":"2020-10-24T03:09:56+00:00","filename":"aac2de37bf39f5efbd3f0210204192d8.jpg","authentication":"e3ca01526a1a8775126af53f4d247265","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_01_fl_22_006_003_o2.jpg","size":1214514,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2803,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0401195148055649986051918176599428988993167877197265625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["041650"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["041650"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180531"],"TimeCreated":["041650"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"aac2de37bf39f5efbd3f0210204192d8.jpg","FileDateTime":1586649032,"FileSize":1214514,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2803\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2803,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:06:04 16:39:18","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:05:31 04:16:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:05:31 04:16:50","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"SubSecTimeOriginal":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2868,"ExifImageLength":3683,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1215,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1215","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"2 pages   Do write soon. love to all.\nthat I have not right to expect it will be always so more when afflictions are sent 'think it a strange thing':\n\n  I desire on my part to rejoice with trembling and to live so as to be in some good measure prepared for whatever awaits me.

I shall probably come home sometime the first or middle of next week.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102840,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102840","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T00:37:30+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:26+00:00","filename":"17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg","authentication":"611d128ace857e86b6c4c2d2a7e56635","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_184_015_002_o2.jpg","size":1292181,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2415,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049543018173453003127892912971219629980623722076416015625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["032613"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["032613"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["032613"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"17c65bacf93d8588ee65464df7c97f36.jpg","FileDateTime":1595810207,"FileSize":1292181,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2415\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2415,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:30:18","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:01 03:26:13","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:01 03:26:13","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2079,"ExifImageLength":3098,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1282,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1282","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Beautiful weather exceedingly, and I enjoy it all the more for getting a nice letter from you today.\nSunday & Monday, After a week of very fine weather, was a great rain.

Dec. 7  1863\nILLINOIS.\nDearest Nettie\n\n I most always write to you When I am here on the Sabbath Day, whether I do other times or not. Yesterday I did not happen to have any pen or ink. But, Oh how I did want a letter from you. I really expected one Saturday but it did not come.\n\nYesterday was Episcopalian day.

Could be if I had several times as long to stay.\n\nMr. Keyes comes up every day no matter what the weather is. Now a days it is really quite an under taking 5 or 6 Miles of Illinois Mud roads. Two creeks to cross - by fording. Nearly swimming they are too now. One or two days this week they were so. Last night was another great rain Mr. Keyes came up this morning before Six Mile Creek got up. To night it is undoubtedly swimming deep, but he went back just at night saying he could turn his horse out on the side and there was a big tree fallen high across the stream that he could cross in.\nMr. Keyes' health appears very good, he has had no cold or cough all winter, and I think looks stronger than I ever saw him.\n\nHe eats but twice a day ever nowadays. Comes up here in the Morning, and eats nothing till he gets home at night.\n\nI hardly know whether I shall get down there or not. I have not much time to spare certainly.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102884,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102884","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/dc28cf6c88ab44654e123465e3f5c5a8.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/dc28cf6c88ab44654e123465e3f5c5a8.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/dc28cf6c88ab44654e123465e3f5c5a8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/dc28cf6c88ab44654e123465e3f5c5a8.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T00:38:25+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:26+00:00","filename":"dc28cf6c88ab44654e123465e3f5c5a8.jpg","authentication":"96b096cb242fa76edf67947e8e0bb283","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_186_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1439990,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2315,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057594992400608002736106527663650922477245330810546875},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033309"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033309"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033309"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"dc28cf6c88ab44654e123465e3f5c5a8.jpg","FileDateTime":1595810209,"FileSize":1439990,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2315\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2315,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:32:06","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:01 03:33:09","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:01 03:33:09","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"SubSecTimeOriginal":57,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3129,"ExifImageLength":4865,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1282,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1282","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"This evening I called around and had a long talk with Aunt Sally, - Mrs. Root. \nShe is very well this winter, apparently better than usual for some years, and just as happy as ever she was.\nIt was enough to do anyone - a christian at least, good, to hear her talk of Anna, and of her death. \nShe did not mourn at Anna's death, rather rejoiced - could have shouted with joy when she died, or as she lay dead in the house. Her very coffin, and her grave more a joy and a pleasure to her. She was a joy and a pleasure to her while she lived, and she had been ever since.\nBy the way, some one ought to write Aunt Sally's life. You know she was with her husband, first pioneer in all this region. He came out her[e] to establish a ferry on Muddy river, on the old great Shawne[e]town & Kaskaskia Trail. That was in 1819. There was no St. Louis then you know hardly .  The old French town of Kaskaskia was the end of the world in this direction as it were. and its outlet was through here to the Ohio River at Shawneetown. The nearest white family or person was 12 miles either way to the ferries on the next rivers.\nShe said last night she had lived night after night by the week entirely alone, no other human being within twelve miles; and why should she be afraid to stay alone in her house now with kind neighbors within call on either side. She had no patience nowadays with folks that complained of hardship and disagreeables of living in this country. \nI mean to get home Friday or Saturday next though I expect I shall have to go by way of Chicago which will take a little longer.\nI hope to get a letter from you Monday.\nSincerely\nIsaac","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102885,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102885","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/1cedf874f7788463492d4c0fb02b86f5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/1cedf874f7788463492d4c0fb02b86f5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/1cedf874f7788463492d4c0fb02b86f5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1cedf874f7788463492d4c0fb02b86f5.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T00:38:26+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:26+00:00","filename":"1cedf874f7788463492d4c0fb02b86f5.jpg","authentication":"22830a8dab794edb22b3d849be3533ef","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_186_005_001_o2.jpg","size":1507522,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3600,"resolution_y":2519,"compression_ratio":0.055413009277638002048060883453217684291303157806396484375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["003919"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["003919"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["003919"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1cedf874f7788463492d4c0fb02b86f5.jpg","FileDateTime":1595810209,"FileSize":1507522,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3600\" height=\"2519\"","Height":2519,"Width":3600,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/16.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:32:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.200000000000000011102230246251565404236316680908203125,"FNumber":16,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 00:39:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 00:39:19","ShutterSpeedValue":2.321928000000000213987050301511771976947784423828125,"ApertureValue":8,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":44,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3395,"ExifImageLength":2376,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1282,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1282","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY.\n\nNo. 1.]  Terms and Conditions on which this and all Messages are Received by these Companies Respectively.\n\n  In order to guard against and correct as much as possible some of the errors arising from atmospheric and other causes appertaining to telegraphy,  every important message should be repeated, by being sent back from the station at which it is to be received to the station from which it is originally sent.

May 24th 1866  St. Louis, MO.\n\nVery Dearest\n\n Have just returned from the Grand Excursion to the Iron Mountain and Pilot Knob. Have just got and read your letter of the 21sr I am exceeding sorry about Mrs. Furber coming and going without you. I thought at first I would start right off tomorrow morning for home direct; but upon reflection concluded it w'd be too late at that perhaps, besides that I ought to go to DuQuoin  However perhaps it will not make much difference, we will find some one going East to accompany you. I will stay my time out, and come home at my leisure. You get all ready to as to start any time you get a good chance: Then you can start whenever there is a chance, and take your time. I want you should have a good long summer to rest, recruit, and get fat & strong, lay in a stock of health & strength as they tell about, and as I am doing nowadays. Not worry and tire yourself visiting about at a thousand and one places all summer; but go there to George's. where you can have the whole benefit of the bracing sea air and just take your time for it, all summer. And I will try and arrange to come after you.\n\nA great trip today; special train, 6 last Cars on the R.Rd Gen. Assembly 200 and about 100 citizens of St Louis. I wished greatly you were along (as the western folks say) many times, 87 Miles, starting at 7 A.M. Pilot Knob at 10. A great Iron Furnace by arrangement just ready for a blast ~( the running out of the melted Iron) which is quite a sight for one who has not seen it; and then the Climb up the Mountain which is just a big pile of solid Iron about 600 ft high; upon the ragged tops of which the picturesquely grouped party first sang America, then listened to sundry speeches of Welcome, and glorification, and description of surroundings, and of the battle ground in the plain below; then a prayer from the grand old Scotchman Dr. McCosh, singing etc. Then down the Mountain Pacific Dinner; and I guess there was food enough for a regiment of a thousand men. Visit the battle field & back to St Louis by 6 P.M.\nThe N.S. Assembly is expected to adjourn on Monday next I may possible go to DuQuoin on Saturday, probably not however till Monday. I do not mean to stay there more than a day or two.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102909,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102909","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f2cd0ae3699c38c7e901fee87aeced8f.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f2cd0ae3699c38c7e901fee87aeced8f.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f2cd0ae3699c38c7e901fee87aeced8f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f2cd0ae3699c38c7e901fee87aeced8f.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T00:48:33+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:26+00:00","filename":"f2cd0ae3699c38c7e901fee87aeced8f.jpg","authentication":"00e37e10e39b8df9857c3e0b55ff2dfa","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_187_010_001_o2.jpg","size":1196602,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2234,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04959556019761900136355592394465929828584194183349609375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033724"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033724"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033724"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f2cd0ae3699c38c7e901fee87aeced8f.jpg","FileDateTime":1595810900,"FileSize":1196602,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2234\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2234,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:33:13","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:01 03:37:24","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:01 03:37:24","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1950,"ExifImageLength":3142,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1282,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1282","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I.S.M.\n\n                               St. Louis\n                               May 26 '66                      St. Louis Mo.\n                                                                               May 26, 1866\n\nDearest\n\n I believe I have written to you about our excursion to the Iron Mountain.

About the finest gardens, hot houses & grounds generally that I ever saw, got up, maintained, and thrown open to the public by a single wealthy man of the City.  It is the same man that was a party to a celebrated \"Breach of Promise\" case a year or two ago. A Miss Carstang recovered of him $100,000.00 for breach of promise.  But Shaw got a new trial and got rid of the whole, verdict in his favor.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":102910,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/102910","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b188d3c3faa2af8367542389f231492b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b188d3c3faa2af8367542389f231492b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b188d3c3faa2af8367542389f231492b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b188d3c3faa2af8367542389f231492b.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T00:48:34+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:46:26+00:00","filename":"b188d3c3faa2af8367542389f231492b.jpg","authentication":"e99d78156bae8a73db29ef52435ded33","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_187_010_002_o2.jpg","size":1234575,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2199,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051983856298316998001407540641594096086919307708740234375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033733"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033733"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180801"],"TimeCreated":["033733"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b188d3c3faa2af8367542389f231492b.jpg","FileDateTime":1595810900,"FileSize":1234575,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2199\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2199,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:33:15","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:01 03:37:33","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:01 03:37:33","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.9188629999999999853343979339115321636199951171875,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1961,"ExifImageLength":3209,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1282,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1282","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I have written a long letter all about these great ecclesiastical proceedings &c. &c. to the respected and very reverend John N.

I am suspicious that it was occasioned merely by riding backwards, in the cars.\n\nI ought to have thought of it when you got in the cars. Perhaps simply the riding backwards from here to Cleveland might have disturbed the stomach, and she did not get over it all day; while if she had started right she might not have suffered. I am afraid you were too tired and ought to have staid in Boston, and rested a day. Am quite anxious to hear of yr safe arrival at Yarmouth. I mailed a letter Thursday Morning, and another Friday Morning, and hope you have got the first one tonight, but probably you will not until Monday. Wish I could look in at the Parsonage and see you this evening. You need not have been a bit afraid of May's being sick in the night. She probably slept all the better for the sickness, and it will not hurt her a bit.\nI wrote you of the \"Festival\", I think. I have not yet heard the results. But it was a frightful storm that eve. About the greatest storm, thundershower - ever known here. And to night is another one somewhat most like it.

Mussey and P.W. Sampsel over I.S. Metcalf & E.C. Griswold. Great Democratic Victory!\n\nVery shrewdly managed by the Dem. leaders who are getting the Irish etc. in fine training for the September State Election. Election was from 10 to 2 oclock. Not a word of opposition, no demonstrations & ordinary light vote then, till half past 1, when about 90 Irish etc almost the full strength of the Democratic Party began to come in and vote in solid phalanx, Bill Whalan; Jim Wogan, Pat Cullin and all. Decent men mainly were at their dinners, and it was too late, (Polls necessarily closing at 2) to make a rally. The result is quite a relief to me. I did not feel at liberty to refuse to serve, while it is a tax any one may well rejoice to be rid of, And to be defeated in that way is really more of an honor than to be elected by an ordinary light vote.

Making three we received during the week: one on Monday which ought to have come Saturday perhaps; one in the Middle of the week and one at its close.  It seems that George is indispensable at Installations &c. But I presume the change in your arrangements is no very great trouble - to you at least. You can just as well go one time as another.   As for my going. I really do not know what to think. Sometimes - and perhaps that is most of the time, I think, that I certainly cannot go at all. It is exceeding warm weather;  By the way, today, yesterday, and the day before, are called about the hottest weather ever known here. The \"heated term\" is upon us in full force. People already begin to talk of '54. It is only just one week since it rained, and it is already a burning drough.  The hot weather \"takes hold\" of little folks you know: They are cross and restless and need somebody to take care of them.

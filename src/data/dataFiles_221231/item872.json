Mary was the grand-niece of Frances Slocum, who, as a five year-old white girl in 1778, had been taken from her home in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania by Delaware Indians. Frances and her brother Isaac (Mary\u2019s grandfather) were re-united in 1837, and in 1846, Isaac\u2019s son, the Rev. George Remington Slocum (Mary\u2019s father), moved his family from Rochester, NY to Peru, Indiana to be near Frances who lived in \"Deaf Man\u2019s Village\" on the Wabash River, where she had gone to live years ago with her husband, Deaf Man, a Miami Indian. Rev. Slocum introduced Christianity to the Miamis there, established a Sunday School, and was able to convince some of the merits of baptism and temperance.

Wonder if you realize it. Last week Tuesday J. Eddie came here and remained over night. The next day he and cousin M. came up to Remsen and Saturday evening we all came down together, John Eddie going right on to Clinton. I do not think we would or could have got away from home without their help. The weather was very mild and pleasant all the week and only after we were safe within cousin M's comfortable home was there a change. Before John Eddie reached Clinton it began to rain. We had a letter from him this a.m. He says the rain stopped before he reached the top of the hill. there was some hail and we think he did not get very wet, altho'\nin margins:\nfrom you soon and I am sorry we could not have sent you a box of goodies from home. Cousin M. brought us some nice sweet oranges and bananas of which we partook unsparingly and enjoyed hugely all through her visit with us. We also made much of John's? present. Gave Mrs. P. 7 lemons which were left when we came away. She was very much pleased to get them.

If a hog had as many stomachs as a cow I don\u2019t know how John could find enough to fill all with his 22 big hogs. He gives them shelled corn cooked in milk or water - 4 pails full I think twice a day - corn on the cobs, milk, rotten apples, kitchen slops etc. John puts 1\/2 a cup of thick cream, every morning when he skims, for Mary. Her stomach has not encouraged her to eat it the last two days so I kept it for her - but when it got sour first day I ate it. Today I put it in the Jonny cake! You ought to have a piece! I take three cups of buttermilk , two eggs, two table spoonfulls of sugar, salt, soda, a little flour and corn meal to make a rather thin batter. Usually I put two tablespoonfulls of malted shortening. I wish this sheet was larger. Good by with love.

Her stomach has troubled her so that she could not eat, only sip hot water, Now since Saturday she has been taking beef tea - made of stock that I once pasted up and addressed to you. Mary was anxious lest it might get heated some way in uncle Sam's pocket  and be melted enough to run.  It was in a qt. baking powder can I  turned it wrong side up and put it on a box close to our fire. Then forgot all about it & went on with my letter writing. When I did look the stock was running out slightly. So I  put it away thinking I would put sealing wax on\nin top margin\n\nit is a beautiful day- cool and no dust. There was some frost last night which showed on the hay near the barns early this a. m., but not enough to injure the corn. What do you think of the little surprise boy at Turin? It seems so strange to think that Ray is no longer baby. He is a precious darling! No adventurous brother baby can oust him out of that title and I\u2019ve no doubt he is just as full of mischief and not a bit set up because he\u2019s not the youngest in the family. I must try to write to them. I made cake, pies (one gooseberry and one mince) and cookies yesterday for our lunch and Mary cooked a nice piece of corned beef to slice cold. We have also jelly and gooseberry sauce. Love to all. Mary is better. Rest well.

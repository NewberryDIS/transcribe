Procured a handleless frying pan from a resident. Stow. Somebody on the opposite the river - crossed the river on a ferry. Camped on Richmond Prairie = Soil Rich, weather fine, traveled twenty four miles.\nJuly 30th Friday - This morning while riding, I lost my splendid meerschaum, a gift of Bro. H D Bristol, Lawyer, a man endeared to me not only by association as a foster brother, but by more and worthy motives - that of the 'mystic tee'. I regretted the loss very much, and spent two or three hours in vain search for it. Crossed several sloughs and got mired several times. Rained hard all day. At noon we overtook the Red River train, homeward bound, they were camped near a lake, waiting for reinforcements as they were afraid of the predatory bunches of Sioux who infested that portion of the country, and who would not spare a train that came in their way, if numerically stronger - the train was composed of half-breds with Red River Carts, a curiosity by the way, being destitute of iron with the exception of the staples in the shafts. They work mostly oxen. From them we procured a little of the \"Red Eye\" which proved salutary in its effects, considering the condition we were then in, having been wet from early dawn and with us prospects of drying soon. Bidding them goodbye, we passed Lakes Henry and George. Rained hard all day. Country prairie and timber, soil rich. Night very chilly and mosquitoes troublesome.

On this lake i noticed a yellow pond flower that I never witnessed before, but they were not attractive. Camped at the cabin. Weather Clear.\nAug 1st - Sunday - Bid farewell to our bachelor host. At noon we passed White Bear Lake, the scenery around this lake, which is large, surpassed anything in picturesque beauty, anything I had yet seen, it was truly all that an artist desired. The soil however, where we traversed is gravely and rocky. At this place we caught up with the Ox teams of Amesbury's party and from this place we traveled together. They had left us at St. Paul, they made no stoppage. Met a party of surveyors who had been out on Government surveys, but now were homeward bound.

Rained hard all night and the mosquitoes finding a good shelter from the rain proved very annoying.\nAUG 3d - Tuesday - Passed Lightning Lake, a very beautiful and shallow lake. To-day, timber was very scarce - the traveling was bad, owing to the heavy rains. During the day we had one of our wagons break down, but soon repaired the damage. Water plenty - Arrived at Otter Tail River in the evening and camped on the opposite banks. The river is about eighty feet wide, with a very bad and miry bottom depth of ford, about three feet.

Consequently, the traveling was bad, the rest of our march through was very good, having ascended the headlands we found a dry and hard road.

The animals laid down and in a measure relieved themselves of the pestilence, as we found that the mosquitoes did not come very low down.

Houck upon coming within range of his unerring rifle, dismounted and fired, and as he fired, his horse left him, frightened. The bull was seen to stagger, and at this moment, Hinds came up and let him have the contents of both barrels in a ticklish gait, which brought him to the ground.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":57538,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/57538","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/6b207bbe899af21dc00efc35537c0a18.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/6b207bbe899af21dc00efc35537c0a18.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/6b207bbe899af21dc00efc35537c0a18.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6b207bbe899af21dc00efc35537c0a18.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-13T20:37:03+00:00","modified":"2020-01-28T20:52:52+00:00","filename":"6b207bbe899af21dc00efc35537c0a18.jpg","authentication":"99383927bda7cf4f025fd4442c1a7f5c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":20,"original_filename":"GR_2243_0011_o2 copy.jpg","size":582390,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2243,"compression_ratio":0.048082924654481003223782664690588717348873615264892578125},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6b207bbe899af21dc00efc35537c0a18.jpg","FileDateTime":1520973403,"FileSize":582390,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2243\"","Height":2243,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2243,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":336,"YResolution":336,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:13 12:47:37","Exif_IFD_Pointer":236},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":386,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6264},"EXIF":{"ExifVersion":221,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2243}}}},"item":{"id":921,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/921","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Across the Plains\n1858\nAug 9th\nWe soon dispatched him, and replenished our larder with the most choice portions, leaving the rest to the wolves and vultures.

It appears that he got out of the boat at a point on the river and walk for a re-creation to the next point, having arrived there he waited some time for the batteaux to come along. Finally tired of waiting and entertaining the idea that it had passed, he trudged along, and finally lost himself. Having started with nothing on his feet but a pair of moccassins he soon wore them out in the grass. Finding our trail he concluded it would be best for him to follow the banks of the river, which he did, He was a miserable looking specimen of the genus homo when he made his entre into our camp. His feet were badly lascerated. We soon had him a meal cooked for him by Mrs Rollette, and the way he made the viands disappear was truly astonishing to the natives. He never strayed away from the party after that. Visited British Fort\nAug 16th Monday - Batteaux arrived early this morning, they cursed like devils at the tediousness of the voyage and the crookedness of the river. Traded one of our Armenian horses for an Indian pony and cart. Again visited the Fort, which is situated on the bank of the river nearly on the line.

Mr Sergeant and Hinds came into camp during the morning, having stayed all night at Fort Geary. At noon, we bid farewell to our host and hostess as also Mr Sergeant, pulled up stakes and started. Camped at a small village on the banks of the Assinneboin. Roads good  - sloughs bridged - character of the country, low and flat prairie interspersed with thickets and timber of small growth. On the opposite banks is a heavy body of lower growth. This village which is situated at the foot of the Assineboin pondage boasts of a Catholic church and a nunnery. Here we were welcomed by Mr Velpeau, a native of French descent, and to whom we were indebted for a bottle of Scotland's favorite beverage, 'Mountain Dew'. The feed here for our animals was excellent, the mosquitoes proved somewhat troublesome. Distance from Mr Roan, 13 miles.\nAug 23d Monday - Passed the Portage trading post, a tributary of the Hudson Bay. Met a train coming in from the plains loaded with pemmican, buffalo robes, skins and furs. Bought a dressed buffalo skin from one of the hunters which cost about 50 cents.

While hitching, a hunter bound for the settlements, from him we learned that we were on the wrong trail and were then going to Swan Lake. We struck a bargain with him to take us to the right trail, giving him a shirt and two plugs of tobacco. We cut across the country, and early in the afternoon came to it, the guide then left us, after giving us directions how to proceed to White Horse Plains. We lost by this operation, about ten miles. While cutting across the country we found plenty of high bush cranberries, and choke cherries. Wood and water plenty, character of the country, changing for the better - soil diversified. Travel on direct course 25 miles.\nAug 25 Wednesday - Roads very bad - met a train of eight carts of Bungee Indians traveling south. Wood and water scarce. Arrived at White Horse Settlement, being the last on the route, about two o'clock. Here we found two Americans, one from Virginia and the other a Missourian. Occupied the afternoon in making after for our carts in case we should have any break downs. Immediately upon pitching our camp, Hinds, whose conduct as leader has become too overbearing, and who took particular pains to vent his spleen on myself, kicked up a rumpus as usual, and waded into my affections. For the first time we came to close quarters and there is no knowing who would have had the best of it, had we not been parted by the rest of the company - to offset his activity. I possessed the wind and I flatter myself that in the end I would have worried him out. About half an hour afterwards he asked my pardon, which was freely granted, and shook hands.

As the river was cold we cast lots who should swim across and pull the flat boat over, it fell to the lot of Jas. E Smith of our mess. Over he went and we all crossed in three crossings. As the last load was coming off,  three half breeds, attaches of the Fort Ellise, seen before we descended the banks, came and met us with the intention of bringing the boat across. Leaving the river we wound around the foot of the hill we finally ascended in somewhat circuitous route some portions of which was very steep and bad. After arriving at the summit we proceeded about half a mile and came to Fort Ellice. This fort is situated on a high table land at the confluence of the Assinneboin River and Beaver Creek. It has a fine commanding position of the surrounding country and could when necessity compelled resist a large army of savages. At the Fort we saw quite a number of Indians of the Rabbit Skin tribe. Here we caught up with Mr. Pambrun's train, consisting of ten carts, himself and three half breeds bound for Red Deer Lake situated about 299 miles north of Fort Pitt. Fort is under the supervision of Wm McKay from whose hands we received welcome. Bought another dressed buffalo skin - some marrow, fat etc..

We cast it aside for our pemmican rubbaboo, made of flour and pemmican, boiled. The half-breeds consider skunk a luxury, and will set aside all other meats, taking it as a preference. For my part, I could not find it palatable, and as for the scent, imagine for yourself. Weather fair- wood and water plenty. Camped near a lake and green grove - traveled about twenty-five miles. Night being clear, we saw for the first time the Great Comet, near the Polar Bear - it presented quite a brilliant appearance.

From Mr. Pambrun, who could talk their language fluently and who acted as our interpreter, they learned where we were from and to where we were bound. They seemed much surprised that such a small party should undertake such a trip.  As the chief made us a present, he of course expected on in return, which we gave in the shape of tobacco.  We invited the chief and one or two others to sup with us, and we feasted with them pork and beans, with which they seemed delighted, especially the beans. After supper, we circulated the pipe, taking a few whiffs, and then passing it on to the next, and so on, until the pipe was empty. They appeared much pleased with our sociability, and when they retired, the Chief appointed venerable old man to stay in our camp all night to watch any of the young braves that came around, and to see that nothing was stolen from us.

They were well mounted, and to see them capering and prancing around us while on our march, was indeed picturesque. They escorted us to the fort, where we arrived about three o'clock. For Pitt is situated on a table land of considerable extent on the South side of the Saskatchewan, and holds a commanding position, it is built like the rest of the forts.

We stood it like heroes for awhile, but we soon got sick of it, as it was \"too much of the good thing,\" and furthermore if we had stayed much longer, we'd had to bunk down with them, as they compelled us to drink, whenever they did. Bidding farewell to Mr Pambrun we took our leave.\nBefore the performance commenced, Mr. Pambrun bought one of our carts and harness paying its value in provisions. Mr. Pambrun's course from Fort Pitt was north to Red Deer Lake. on our way back, we called at the Fort and seeing several bushels of potatoes, which had been raised there, (latitude about 53 degrees North) we induced Mr. Simpson to part with a bushel, charging us only a shilling, which is about twenty-two cents in American money, very reasonable, much more so than in the States. Money is so scarce in this country, that when they get a sight of a shilling, they are willing to part with almost anything to gain possession of it. Shouldering our potatoes, we moved for the boat and found it in waiting. The boat was large enough to carry all of our chattels, and carts too.

Capt. Blackiston having finished his labor was making preparations to proceed to Fort Carleton and winter there and expressed his willingness to forward all letters we wished to send, an offer gratefully accepted. We intimated to Mr. Christie our desire of exchanging our carts and oxen for horses, and as he stood in need of both, he promised that he would attend to it on the morrow. The Indian lodges we found here, consisted  Crees, Blackfeet, Surzees? and Stowees?. They were waiting for the Fort to trade with them.

We gave our Indian guide a gun, some ammunition, blanket and some few trifling articles, with which he seemed satisfied. saw plenty of deer and antelope. Plenty of trout in the river. Camped at the foot of the Rocky Mountains near Bow River. Traveled about twenty five miles. Weather cold and freezing during the night. The mountain at the foot of which we are camped is very high and precipitous and apparently but a short distance from the \"Devil's Head.\nNov 3 - Wednesday - Crossed Bow River in the morning passed several carts that had been abandoned. The river at the fording is about 150 feet wide, shallow, but rapid. Ascended and descended an upland and came to a valley now fairly in the mountains. We are now following the a stream of considerable size, pure and clear, crossed and re-crossed several times. Traveled about sixteen miles. This valley is very heavily timbered with pine, spruce, hemlock, yew. The weather pleasant. Guide killed an antelope in the evening.\nNov 4 Thursday - Our path today lay through a dense forest with heavy windfalls, especially in the burnt district. Trail very rough. Amesbury killed an English Mountain Cock. Rather smaller than the native of England. Traveled only about eight miles, as we had to use the axes considerably, which delayed us. Snowed a little during the night.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":57598,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/57598","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e5c18deacf33f29e830a12f70a29e809.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e5c18deacf33f29e830a12f70a29e809.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e5c18deacf33f29e830a12f70a29e809.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e5c18deacf33f29e830a12f70a29e809.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-13T20:37:49+00:00","modified":"2020-03-30T04:03:26+00:00","filename":"e5c18deacf33f29e830a12f70a29e809.jpg","authentication":"deb16962a02ea55d51c8b8c54876d749","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":80,"original_filename":"GR_2243_0041_o2 copy.jpg","size":543260,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2222,"compression_ratio":0.0452761942860950006295439607129083015024662017822265625},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"By-line":["L"],"DateCreated":["20080626"],"TimeCreated":["161806-0700"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"By-line":["L"],"DateCreated":["20080626"],"TimeCreated":["161806-0700"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0002"],"By-line":["L"],"DateCreated":["20080626"],"TimeCreated":["161806-0700"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e5c18deacf33f29e830a12f70a29e809.jpg","FileDateTime":1520973405,"FileSize":543260,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2222\"","Height":2222,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/9.0","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2222,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":336,"YResolution":336,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:13 12:48:00","Artist":"L","Exif_IFD_Pointer":292},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":766,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5171},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666669995022775907500545145012438297271728515625,"FNumber":9,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2008:06:26 16:18:06:07:00","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":6.3398500000000002074784788419492542743682861328125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2222,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3086.9257950530000016442500054836273193359375,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3091.29511677280015646829269826412200927734375,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":921,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/921","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1858 Nov 5th Friday - Trail very bad.

It was dark when we stopped and as we found a small lake with good grass, we stopped on account of the feed for our animals, not dreaming that we were so close to a precipice. We were not more than forty fee off. If any of our party had wandered in that direction, he would certainly have went over, as it was appallingly dark. Our guide was quite sulky today, because we would not camp where he wanted us to.\nNov 7th Sunday - Ascended to the top of the ridge and came to a stream in our descent running in a contrary direction from the one we had hitherto followed. Saw quite a number of white grouse, a beautifuyl snow white bird with red feet and eyes. So white were they that could hardly see them as they alighted on the snow. We killed a mess, the meat is rather blackish and tough, they are very small. We also saw a few Rocky Mountain sheep, but could not get a shot. The snow on the ridge was about four feet deep in places, the summit of the ridge presented a bleak and desolate appearnce, while all around us as far as the eye could reach, lofty and precipitous snow capped peaks reared themselves in majestic grandeur.

The latter course involved a terrible risk. We had only six days' provisions left, and should our hypothesis prove incorrect, and no trail found in the valley below, it was almost certain that every one of us would perish by cold and hunger as, unless some other route could be found, it would be impossible for us to retrace our steps. Taking these into consideration we held a council, and all was unanimous for going ahead. Had a single voice been heard in favor of returning, we had never crossed the Mountains, but perilous as was our position, not one of the little band faltered, \"Onward,\" had ever been our motto and was so still. And without further hesitation we commenced the descent.\nWe had not proceeded but a short distance, before the mountain became so steep, that neither man nor horse could retain their footing for the distance of about five hundred feet. As soon as we gained footing we divested the animals of their packs, and shoved them one by one over the ridge, and for the first four hundred feet they rolled down headlong.

We now commenced to trade wit the Indians, our useless trinkets, and worn out clothing for provisions, in which we had the best of the trade. We laid in a supply of provisions for seventeen days, being the time that Mr. Linkeater said it would take us. Hall traded off his horse, and got a good one in return. When the vesper hour was tolled at eve by a small bell, - the Indians suddenly left our camp and made for the chapel, old and young, to perform the evening service. The service lasted I should think about fifteen minutes, and as the day was bitter cold and no fire in the chapel, they must have suffered somewhat from the cold. They appear to be very zealous and devout in the performance of their rites, they are strictly honest, and you can lay anything down and leave it, without any fears of it being stolen. If any of them is tempted to steal it, all you have to do is to inform the chief, that some of his men have stolen such an article, and it will be forthcoming in a few minutes. We were presented with a fine mess of dried buffalo meat and about a pound of fresh butter, by the chief, O-Kale-kik-ha-lo-la, the latter article made by his family. It was very creditable butter, and far superior to the rancid trash that is set on the tables of many of the Western hotels.

It fell upon the lot of Houck, Jones and Palmer, to go.\nFeb 24th  Thursday.--Procured three pair of snow Shoes from the Indians. At noon, we made preparations to start, taking with us two blankets, and ten pounds of dried horse meat, apiece. Calculating that it would take us about ten days to make the trip. The Indians said it was only five days. While we were making preparations, three squaws made their appearance with a supply of moss, which they wished to trade. We made known to them our intention of starting for the Fort. They then knelt down and offered up prayers to the Giver of all Good, for our welfare and a prosperous journey.

Not a scene of our past journey or the future that lay before us presented itself. I was questioned as usual, but could make no reply, but that I thought that we were out of danger, as I did not dream of anything concerning the trip. Started early. We soon came to swift current and rapids, at crossed out and soon reached in close proximity to a face. We were all fearful, (except the Indian) that we were going over, and our minds were in a fearful state, for we though that he could not manage the canoe in such rapids, but when within about twenty feet of the falls, and close in to shore, by a dexterous movement he moored the canoe into a small bay which was hidden by rocks. Here we effected a landing, and made a portage of about two hundred yards. Reloading we were soon on our way, and reached \"old Pauls\" encampment about crossed out late in the afternoon. Where we were kindly received.

They met with no Indians till they arrived at \"Old Paul's\" encampment, where they found several lodges, and where they traded all they could spare for provisions. From the Indians they learned the direction which to take. After they had gained the summit of the Mountain they struck off on the ridge in a parallel direction with the valley they saw to their right in a south westerly course. They wandered for some time, and finally reached the Spokane range of Mountains, where they struck a trail, following for some time they finally reached \"Spokane Geary's\" encampment, on Spokane River, having been three days without a morsel to eat. They arrived there on New Year's Eve and just in time to participate in their ceremonies. Their mode of celebrating is similar to that of the Koottonais. They were kept there for four days, and a messenger was sent with them to Colville Valley. Spokane Geary, the head chief of the tribe by that name, was educated at the Catholic Institute at Fort Geary, on Red River, hence his name. He talks and writes very good English and French.

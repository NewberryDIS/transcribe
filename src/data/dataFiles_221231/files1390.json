August 12, 1945\nDear Jack:\nGlad to hear from you. I've wanted to look you up in Chicago more than once but it didn't seem easy to find you. Next time I get up I'll give you a ring.\nI haven't seen Sullivan nor heard from him for almost a year, but he probably still lives at the same place -- 4061 Blaine.  Give him my best when you see him. Maybe I can get down there myself before too long. By the way, if he's moved you'll be able to find him through his mother, Mrs. Frank? Soto, who has a phone (I believe).\nI read your reviews in the Sun and I also noticed somewhere recently that you're going to be connected with a Chicago version of the New Yorker.  I'm going to look up your new book -- I haven't seen it yet. I'll be glad to recommend it for the library here if they haven't bought it yet, and to talk it up.\nTell Crenshaw to get the hell on the ball or I'll beat him into print. Two other guys and I are writing a college composition textbook which is pretty far along now. We're hoping to benefit by the pickup in college attendance that's going to come about in the next 2 or 3 years.\nHeard about that encyclopedia a while back but didn't know you were one of the editors.

How are you? It seems that it was not long ago since I visited you at your house, but a year has gone by. I moved to Lawrence again Last April and have been extreemly [sic] busy with work, house and the family. However I have had many thoughts about you, your books and the impression they made on me. It has been so grand to know a truly free spirited person like you.   People such as yourself bring meaning to boring monotenous [sic] days. I missed your birthday, Christmas and I guess the New Year. But I told myself I should drop you a note and just see how are things with you, and also to let you know that I did not totally forget you.\nHappy belated birthday, Christmas and the best wishes for the New Year.\ntake care\nSincerely\nMaryam Charmchi","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":119478,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/119478","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ae45ae02f6a8b3ece3dd8a6586bf1cc5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ae45ae02f6a8b3ece3dd8a6586bf1cc5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ae45ae02f6a8b3ece3dd8a6586bf1cc5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ae45ae02f6a8b3ece3dd8a6586bf1cc5.jpg"},"added":"2021-06-14T20:48:49+00:00","modified":"2021-08-28T04:08:07+00:00","filename":"ae45ae02f6a8b3ece3dd8a6586bf1cc5.jpg","authentication":"2957d761098999942826c527da14b9da","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"midwest_ms_conroy_box_005_fl_269_001_001_o2.jpg","size":1048064,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3600,"resolution_y":1932,"compression_ratio":0.050229276895943565650615170170567580498754978179931640625},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20210413"],"TimeCreated":["013700-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["992006198805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Conroy Box 5"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20210413"],"TimeCreated":["013700-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["992006198805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Conroy Box 5"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20210413"],"TimeCreated":["013700-0500"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["IMLS CLIR 2020"],"Credit":["992006198805867"],"Source":["Midwest MS Conroy Box 5"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"}},"item":{"id":1390,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1390","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"[sheet torn from a calendar dated February 1934]\nDear Joe: - 'Am sorry not finding you.

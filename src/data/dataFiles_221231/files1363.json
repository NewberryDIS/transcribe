Cooke who was principal Commissioner tells me that - he ordered that Waggons should not be sent - in case of a difficulty. Gl. Lamar hoped during his Administration that with the few that he ultimately permitted to go, could have been able to have revolutionized Santa Fe in favor of Texas & then had a direct trade - Poes jucio haber en asto - And as Texas claims the Rio Grande as its boundary, he fondly hoped to have had it soon enrolled as a Texan Ag?\n\n But their would have been difficulty with the U.S. Traders, for had it succeeded, it must have curlacted? their trade - But a much better trade awaits the Texans - Viz the Rio Grande & onwards to Chihuahua.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":115717,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/115717","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/59b7fb79abf5ec710200e0aee65a00ae.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/59b7fb79abf5ec710200e0aee65a00ae.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/59b7fb79abf5ec710200e0aee65a00ae.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/59b7fb79abf5ec710200e0aee65a00ae.jpg"},"added":"2021-01-14T22:41:16+00:00","modified":"2022-09-09T04:16:19+00:00","filename":"59b7fb79abf5ec710200e0aee65a00ae.jpg","authentication":"d0ab62d3821cd974cad7ce362398bee3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_83b_VL02_Part3_00018_o2.jpg","size":965797,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 300x300, segment length 16, Exif Standard: [TIFF image data, little-endian, direntries=6, manufacturer=Canon, model=Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III, software=Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.6 (Macintosh),","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2819,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.031722471851063548109461720514445914886891841888427734375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120606"],"TimeCreated":["083245"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120606"],"DigitalCreationTime":["083245"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120606"],"TimeCreated":["083245"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120606"],"DigitalCreationTime":["083245"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120606"],"TimeCreated":["083245"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120606"],"DigitalCreationTime":["083245"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"59b7fb79abf5ec710200e0aee65a00ae.jpg","FileDateTime":1610664008,"FileSize":965797,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2819\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2819,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 6.6 (Macintosh)","DateTime":"2012:06:26 13:44:13","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":194},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.0166666666666666664353702032030923874117434024810791015625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:06 08:32:45","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:06 08:32:45","ShutterSpeedValue":5.9068909999999998916564436512999236583709716796875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":68,"SubSecTimeDigitized":68,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027483547688461840152740478515625,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.90476190476192641654051840305328369140625,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1363,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1363","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"X  On the Arroyo of Sn Pedro 1\/2 mile dist  but depredations of the Comanches, forced them to settle the spot now known as Sn Anto, between the Arrroys at Sn Pedro & the San Anto River and put under the Guardianship of San Antonio de Austria & sometimes called the 'Asiento'.

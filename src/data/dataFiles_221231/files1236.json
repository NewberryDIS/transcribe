It seems rather sad to me for her at her age to go way to far from home seeking her fortune. I think it most likely her other enterprise that I wrote something about will be given all up as there are a good many difficulties in the way.\n\n Lucy has been sorely afflicted with headache these 3 months past but is much relieved we all think she owes it to Homeophathy __ I feasted my eyes almost to surputing?, altho' we past it so rapidly, with with the beautiful, the romantic & the grand scenery between Boston & Northfield you have seen it and do not need a description & I could not give it if you did.\n\nHow retir'd and isolated Warwick is there is no Stage at all runs thro' the town now.

Jan. 21, 1854\nis a clever pious woman but from what I have heard said of her think she may be tho' kind hearted etc. rather inclin'd to the Slam bang or Smash about & not so careful & economical as Aunt Conant  they have 5 children as Smart forward & health now I guess. Sam'l has been unfortunate had a great deal of Sickness - when he first started in life he got married & bought a farm all in a hurry without due consideration his Mother thought. He got in debt his Father gave him 2 or 3 hundred dollars to get him out afterwards to better his condition swapt farm & got in debt again which is Father has seem'd to consider an unpardonable Sin & he has firmly held back & determin'd he would not give or lend him & considering what he has done for Hervey S. has some reason to fee bad about it - it is also a burden of Grief to his mother. I do not know but I suspect that he is hard press'd & perhaps in some danger of losing his Farm. Tis possible the feeling that he cannot expect much sympathy or help from his Father or Hervey has induc'd him to think of going away & I fear it will very much distress his Mother. I have made a long story of it, & it is mostly guess work.\n\n I doubt not that Charles will be very comfortable and happy with you  - but he has had a sad time indeed, & a very hard time in consequence of the sickness and Death of Mr. Gilman- besides the disappointment & frustrating his plans about work. But he can probably be useful to you & a benefit to himself in some capacity or other. I us'd to think he had the talent or ability in his for a good \"Boss\" but if he had it has been lain dormant so long I dont know how he would manage.

Do try your influence to stop the whole proceeding for a while in the hot weather\n We have all been almost sick with Colds. I had a very severe cold in the first of the winter. But had got over it & went to Bangor thinking to stay thro' the coldest of the weather. But came home because when Josie was sick he and baby have been sick enough to be very troublesome and require a great deal of care & attention but Charles need not be anxious about them we are being very careful and nursing them up nicely probably they'll be all well long before he'll know they have been unwell. I dont know but I shall get to dislike this Climate in the winter as bad as that in the summer - there are 4 sick at Mr. Livermore - young David has been confin'd all winter with lame knee. Mr. H. Sargent is very sick yet. I spent a week very pleasantly at Bangor with Lucy Eliab & Maria - every is so nice & comfortable there I've had a cold & cough ever since I came home but it doesn't make me sick.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97933,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/97933","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/62584b30e323e9f5e6296f0e1d4ae62e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/62584b30e323e9f5e6296f0e1d4ae62e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/62584b30e323e9f5e6296f0e1d4ae62e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/62584b30e323e9f5e6296f0e1d4ae62e.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:38:31+00:00","modified":"2021-11-14T22:16:04+00:00","filename":"62584b30e323e9f5e6296f0e1d4ae62e.jpg","authentication":"25e8ef106c380347510f96d2c1d30d32","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_83_002_004_o2.jpg","size":1775233,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2884,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.056994946576256998171938761288402019999921321868896484375},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["000346"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["000346"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["000346"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"62584b30e323e9f5e6296f0e1d4ae62e.jpg","FileDateTime":1587317838,"FileSize":1775233,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2884\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2884,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:33:44","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05000000000000000277555756156289135105907917022705078125,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:11 00:03:46","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:11 00:03:46","ShutterSpeedValue":4.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":37,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3477,"ExifImageLength":4340,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1236,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1236","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Charles dont write whether he is glad he went there or not I suspect his chance for sleeping has been some of the time not exactly to his taste he has been particularly partial to a good soft bed.

One way is to strive for such a position in life that you will be call'd upon - necessitated - to act I dont meant physically, only but Morally Intellectually.

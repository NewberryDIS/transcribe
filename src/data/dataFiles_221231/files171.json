Leaming sold him 160 acres of land for 480 dollars which was endorsed on the note & he holds some other collatteral security given him by David & Leaming.  Judge Niles sued David & Leaming to-day for some wood they owed him for.  It is a matter I am not on but I suppose others will sue them & probably ruin them.  It looks dark now, David & Leaming have made much less than I supposed they had since I went out of the mill.  They have taken my name off from some $6000 but only a part of it has been paid but just changed from the liability of N. & D.W. Kendall to the liability of Kendall & Leaming.

Last summer when I came to La Porte I ran down but when I returned to you I immediately commenced gaining.  Do you remember how fast I gained after I returned home to your last fall.  My sleep refreshes me much more when you are by my side than when I sleep alone.  Do you remember how your rubbing me last fall, when I suffered so from  my fall, relieved me instantly of all pain.  When I came here this winter I wa almost free from nervousness compared with what I have suffered from it since you have been gone.

I had looked upon the marriage relations as a partnership where two loving hearts put in all they had & commenced life together not where their parents left off, but where their united means enabled them to commence remembering that their childhood home cost their parents long years of toil, & if they would leave an equally pleasant home for their children they must do the same, unless their parents had been so precuriary blessed as to leave them a home ready made.  Neither your parents nor mine were thus fortunate.  We were married.

You do not know how much happier I shall be about you if I know you are doing as I want you to in this matter.  You have no right to neglect any reasonable wish of your husband which looks to restoring you to health & to him.  It frightens me to think what will become of our children if you are not able to look after them.  Now you will do as I want you to do upon this subject & not put it off a day.  You have put off using mustard day after day til I fear you will not attend to yourself at all.  In wearing flannel as I want after a day or two it will be pleasant to you & you will enjoy it.  Get that which is good & soft.

Brother Erasmus wife a long time ago was thought to be in the consumption but she became pregnant during her pregnancy the inflamation in her lungs was subdued & she has been well ever since.  If you are pregnant I want you with me as much as possible so that I can look after you & make you as happy as I can & do all that is possible to remove the inflation in your lungs.  If you return west I shall be very anxious to have Lydia or Mary return with you & if we go on to our farm you shall have Bill & the buggy to ride & go just where you wish & when you wish.  In any case if we go back to the farm we will not keep a dairy & will not attempt to make any more butter than we use ourselves.  Neither will we board any help for the farm.  We can get along with what I earn here & the proceeds of the farm & the sale of some stock & not keep a dairy or board any one but our own family.  I want if you can find at the Home in Boston an interesting & good girl some ten or twelve years old you should take her provided you think she will be useful to you & we shall love her.  There will doubtless be a school near our prairie farm this summer.  If you get a good & interesting little girl we can give her a good home & she can be of use to us.  If you are pregnant I think our child will be a little girl from the [fact] the impregnation took plan just previous to your menses.  Did you not have a similar small flow of menses when you were first impregnated when gave birth to our little girl.  From what I have recently read I think the time of impregnation influences & determines the sex.  I understand that the ovaries of a woman is each month gradually developed  if it a female but in its full development it is male.  This I see has been demonstrated in animals beyond a doubt.  If you are pregnant you will be glad to have a girl I know & so shall I.  Our boys need a sister.  Be sure & tell me all about yourself & your feelings & what you think is best to do.

It has prostrated us & we have not stamina enough about us to try to rise again.  But if it only serves to make us cheerfully & energetically put forth our efforts we gain strength from our fall.

When we see misfortune approaching we ought to use every means in our power to protect ourselves & those whom God has made dependent upon us from its terrible blasts that it may pass harmlessly by us & ours but when we have done all in our power & still it wrecks us the best we can do is to cheerfully gather up what fragments are left & make the best of it.  It will not change the fact however miserable we may make ourselves, but it will only inflict a greater injury upon us!  We have lived together a long time.  I have at times lost heavily.  Would you have respected & loved me more, if I had sat supinely down & tried to be miserable & to have made you so over my losses, I think not.

I shall hire some one to sow, & plow the grain in myself if I cannot get along otherwise.  This plow is also arranged to tend corn by taking out the middle shovel & then one man & a pair of horses can tend as much corn as two men & two horses can with the double shovel plow.  It is strange what improvements are being made every year in agricultural implements.  I wonder if the agricultural implements of New England keep pace with those of the west.

It was clear sunshine & ware half an hour ago & now it looks as if in a few minutes it would rain hard.  How is your health now & how are the children.  Have your menses yet returned & if not have you any other signs of pregnancy.  I feel very anxious to have you with me & to have you well.  You need to be properly clothed & to have a great deal of outdoor exercise.  Take the best possible care of yourself.  How much good a kiss of love from those dear lips of yours would do me now.  I hope ere long to have you where I shall be daily blessed by your presence & love.  With a loving kiss & a sweet good bye I remain your affectionate husband.  \nN.

I shall expect you here shall I about the first of June.  I hope you will visit Emily before you leave Warwick.  She is your sister & if you do it I think she will be glad to see you & your visit will heal up any wounded feelings she may fancy she has.  If you do not visit her she will only feel harder towards you.  You are my wife & you know I would not counsel this to you unless I felt it was the best possible thing you can do.  You have done her no injury & why should you hesitate to meet her as  a sister & to overlook anything that is necessary to restore harmony between you.  I think Chandler is wrong to advise you not visit her.  Meet her as an affectional sister & you will be happier for it all your life & so will she & she will love you all the better if you show yourself noble & forgiving.  I will make my plans now I know your wishes & write you all about them in a day or two.  I will bring up the trunk here which contains your clothing.  I want to hear from you again before I go down there so as to know just what you want brought up.  Don't you think the house better be painted outside & in before we go down there.  If I can possibly raise the money to do it I want it painted for it will be so much more pleasant & I want you should love our home.  Try  get a good girl at the home.

I am glad you are having such a beautiful spring.  Here in La Porte I never have known so wet & muddy a spring.  It rained I am told most of the time I was gone down to our farm & it has rained most of the time since I returned.  The roads are & have been for a long time almost impassible.  I hope it is not as such at our farm.  They had a very dry winter there but it commenced raining while I was there & I am fearful it has continued to rain.  Mill matters look very dark I don't know how they will come out.  you don't know how much good your last letter has done me.\n\n(along side and top)\nI called this evening on Charles & Ellen.  They seem as cozy & happy as you please in their new home at the Teegarden.  The weather has become pleasant at last & to-night is a beautiful moonlight night but the streets are very muddy yet.  I hope you will go out in the open air as much as possible & take the children out but you of course will use every possible precaution to keep them from taking cold.  How much I wish you were here to-night to talk with me, to sleep with me & to love me.  I should enjoy your warm loving embrace & such kisses as I get from your sweet lips & know you would enjoy it equally well.

I think if you wean him this summer you had better do it before warm weather, but you know how his appetite is & how his health is better than I do & can judge better than I.  I think you had better wean him gradually he has been sick so long.  Feed him more & more & let him nurse less & less & the quicker you begin it the better provided he is well enough.  Tell me when you write me what you think as regards what I have said relation to your menses.  I understand that most women do not menstruate at all as long as they nurse their children. ------\nMr. & Mrs. Walker are in New York City I suppose.  I am told they have advertised their house for sale & expect to leave here.  But it is getting late & with a loving kiss I bid you a sweet good night.  Your affectionate husband \nN.\nSunday P.M.\nIt is a beautiful Sabbath day.  The mud is drying up fast.

I think they have had unpleasant thoughts towards each other if nothing else.  Charles & Ellen with Ellens wishes as I understand decided to board at the Hotel.  In a few days Ellen got sick of it & wanted to keep house.  I advised Charles not to commence keeping house till he had decided what to do for if he did not remain in La Porte it would make it bad for him..  The next time I saw Charles he had hired a small house which Ellen seemed pleasant with & they went to work to get ready to keep house.  Charles & Ellen thought the back kitchen would not do so Charles decided to haul it down & rebuild which well cost him some 15 or 20 dollars. He paid his rent out month in advance.  He got his lumber & nails & he & the carpenter had commenced & hauled down the old kitchen & were putting up the new.  He also got a man to whitewash the house.  Now Ellen has heard of another house which she likes better & is perfectly disgusted with the first house.  Charles don't know what to do.  She tells him she is homesick etc.  I don't know how it will come out.  I greatly fear for him for as I understand he is nearing a point where his funds will be exhausted.  I wish you & Mary would write him a good cheerful letter.  He says he has been looking for letters from you for a long time.  Don't on any account hint anything I have said.  It will only make matters worse.  I should not have written what I have only you wrote me something relative to them in your last.  Charles seems to think he has done all in his power & it is pretty hard not to have his wife satisfied.  Be sure & not start to Lawrence alone & don't on any act. let the baby take cold. Don't start unless the weather is pleasant.  I insist on this.  Be careful & not so bundle the \n(along the side)\nbaby face as to keep him from getting a plenty of fresh air.

I hope when I get into the country with you that I shall feel better.  I have seen Charles to day.  He says Ellen feels satisfied with their house now & he is at work apparently happy in getting it ready to go into.  If possible I want to have our house painted outside & in before","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40078,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/40078","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4f1ee8a5c0580894eede7e0f6dbc97e2.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4f1ee8a5c0580894eede7e0f6dbc97e2.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4f1ee8a5c0580894eede7e0f6dbc97e2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4f1ee8a5c0580894eede7e0f6dbc97e2.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T15:58:08+00:00","modified":"2020-01-21T18:05:19+00:00","filename":"4f1ee8a5c0580894eede7e0f6dbc97e2.jpg","authentication":"ab65ae8b41d7e79ae81076a8a47c4dd2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_01_fl_17_015_03_o2.jpg","size":1223218,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2336,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048484985413496002604194501373058301396667957305908203125},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170714"],"TimeCreated":["032200"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170714"],"TimeCreated":["032200"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170714"],"TimeCreated":["032200"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4f1ee8a5c0580894eede7e0f6dbc97e2.jpg","FileDateTime":1509378607,"FileSize":1223218,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2336\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2336,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:14 15:09:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025000000000000001387778780781445675529539585113525390625,"FNumber":7.0999999999999996447286321199499070644378662109375,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:14 03:22:00","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:14 03:22:00","ShutterSpeedValue":5.3219279999999997698978404514491558074951171875,"ApertureValue":5.655637999999999721012500231154263019561767578125,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"SubSecTimeOriginal":8,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2929,"ExifImageLength":4512,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":171,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/171","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"we go down there.

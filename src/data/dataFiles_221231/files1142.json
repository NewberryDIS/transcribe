Through the advice of some persons we turned off our course which lay through Dayton and proceeded on another route. I think we shall have cause to repeat it as the roads are new. Crossed a branch of the Miami this morning. Stopped at noon to a private house put up to a private house tonight the people very hospitable.\nAugust 1 Crossed the Miami this morning 6 miles from where we staid all night it is the largest River we have crossed since we came from home. It was fordable where we crossed I should think it was 40 rods wide. The village of Troy is situate on it when we crossed it it is quite a pretty village has a court house.

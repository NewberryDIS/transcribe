did not sustain further damage, than that she met with, when the Sea struck her, and as she lay in the trough of the sea yesterday Am- this sea struck her nearly midships, carrying away the water closets on the, Port Side, and about one half of the wheelhouse- with some 6 or 8 barrels, of grease, belonging to the Cook,- at the time the sea struck us there was a fellow in one of the Closets, and he saved himself by clinging to the wreck.-","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69727,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/69727","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7a5455e476f5de5c23b27764c3b1412c.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7a5455e476f5de5c23b27764c3b1412c.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7a5455e476f5de5c23b27764c3b1412c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7a5455e476f5de5c23b27764c3b1412c.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T17:59:22+00:00","modified":"2020-04-22T12:51:52+00:00","filename":"7a5455e476f5de5c23b27764c3b1412c.jpg","authentication":"f1e972ad368e56740382f91f22942f7b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3088_00034_o2

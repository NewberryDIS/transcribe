I passed from Albany to Schenetada over the railroad, and at the latter place took the canal to Oswego designing to see Niagara Falls from the Canada side.  On the canal boat I became acquainted with two young Englishmen and a New Yorker who were on their way to visit the Falls, and we agreed to travel together.  At Oswego we took the steamer Coburg for Niagara. \n\n  Reader, (if any other eyes but my own ever see this manuscript) do you know where Niagara is situated?  I do not mean the falls - every body knows where they are - but a little, mean, low, sandy village in Upper Canada, composed principally of one story frame buildings, hogs, dogs, Canadians and their concomitants, some foreigners, and an occasional live Yankee.  It may be seen after a fortyeight hours' sail westward from Oswego in any of the Ontario steamers; and if you should get there a few minutes too late you will\n\nhave to remain there all night for being at the mouth of the Niagara river the steamers, unless freighted for Lewiston, seldom go up higher and you have to take the morning stage to Chippewa.

Not having recorded any of his remarks at the time am unable to do so now from memory.  In the afternoon staid at home. In the evening heard Mr. Dunbar lecture on the fifth chapter of Acts, from the 14th verse. The aim of his discourse appeared to be the reproving of covetousness, vainglory, connection of church and state &c.  He was very impressive, but, like all zealots in behalf of a particular creed, he seemed to deny that any other denomination preached the Gospel - his church being the only one in which it was to be found in its purity. This he implied, although not directly asserted. It appears to me, that such preaching is wanting in one of the main principles of the Gospel - charity. He is, however, a good man, notwithstanding his bigotry, and errs ignorantly.

I want to say a word to Lester and Annie. \nMuch love\nMartha-","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":50025,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/50025","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/41657ca11936f6d37dd99e71277a5f3e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/41657ca11936f6d37dd99e71277a5f3e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/41657ca11936f6d37dd99e71277a5f3e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/41657ca11936f6d37dd99e71277a5f3e.jpg"},"added":"2017-12-08T16:25:22+00:00","modified":"2020-03-23T14:14:29+00:00","filename":"41657ca11936f6d37dd99e71277a5f3e.jpg","authentication":"80b472bf355a28f1bf5644475352a8a8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_parish_box_01_fl_06_011_003_o2.jpg","size":1038936,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2259,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042584230977325},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20161021"],"TimeCreated":["035106"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20161021"],"TimeCreated":["035106"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20161021"],"TimeCreated":["035106"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"41657ca11936f6d37dd99e71277a5f3e.jpg","FileDateTime":1512750000,"FileSize":1038936,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2259\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2259,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:10:24 11:20:04","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.02,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:10:21 03:51:06","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:10:21 03:51:06","ShutterSpeedValue":5.643856,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":9,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1935,"ExifImageLength":3083,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":224,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/224","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Dear Lester and Annie,\nReceived Lesters letter about the sugar.

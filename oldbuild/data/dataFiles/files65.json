I will say but a few words and leave the stand for those who can address you proffitably.\n  God has been good to us.  We behold the dawness of another New Year's day.  Some who were with us on the last Anniversary have heard their Father's summons and have gone home.  They labor with us still in promoting the glory of their Maker and the best interests of their fellows, but in another and a higher sphere.  We are still left by the All Wise to carry on this enterprise which our departed brothers commenced.  The old year has fled forever.  While our hearts are made sad at the funeral of the old year, a new year greats us with its infant smiles.  Let the dead bury their dead.  Let the scenes that are past be hid in the rubbish of their own collecting.  To us the glorious future unfolds new beauties urging us forward to fresh endeavors.  \n  A solemn time is it to us where the wheels of time bring about a mark in their revolution like that on the spinners real, bidding us pause and reflect.

Sunday, October 31st, 1847\nContrary to my usual practice, it is now, I believe, nearly a whole fortnight since I have written home. However, I presume I need makes no excuse therefor, as it is about three weeks since I have received a letter, or heard a word from Down East. Alfred R. Field Esq., my present immediate superior, has gone down to Northfield to day, and I expect will bring me upon his return about a dozen letters, If he does not, I have made up my mind to be considerably vexed with the inhabitants of Maine. Now, if I were at home, I think I could find a good deal to write to @ poor scamp so far off which would interest him; knowing as well as I do that every thing I could write would be interesting to him.\nBut now, I have quite a mind to give up  writing altogether, as others do. I can of course have nothing of importance to write, merely how I myself am getting on. To be sure, it might be a matter of curiosity simply for people at home to hear once in a while what a fellow was about or whether he was about anything; but then it is of no sort of consequence: it can make no difference: he gets along just as well, whether they know it or even think of it. On the whole perhaps it would be better to write only once a year!

Most, in commencing the business are obliged to serve in some inferior capacity for a year of two at least. perhaps carry a rod for the Level for a year or two without ever getting hold of the instrument itself, or any other instrument. I have now been on the road about a month, instead of being confined to one inferior employment. I have had opportunity to become acquainted with many. In fact, feel already quite familiar with the whole business of Engineering, as far as concerns the surveying & laying out of a road preparatory to building it., preparatory to the work of the paddies. I am now Surveyor of a party of Engineers running a line from here to Bellows Falls. Not the head of the party, his business is to go ahead and tell where to run the line, but the surveyor whose business it is to carry the instrument and run the line.

I do not think very highly of him as an Engineer, he is a little short sighted, and that is as great a defect as once can have. He has however had a good deal of practice, and probably thinks himself much superior to some above him. Joseph A. Stevens is particularly a friend of his, and his father I expect thinks Field has badly influences Joseph's religious opinions. Uncle & family, & Parsons & Hannah you know are, or call themselves, Evangelical Unitarians belong to the Religious Unitarians; are very religious as Wooster Parker said of the Universalist affairs; their religion consist in these things.\nField is a great admirer of Parker. Theodore Parker you know whom some of the other Unitarians consider little better than an infidel. And in fact I think Field is but little better. And Joseph is slightly of the same sort. It is a sort of natural tendency of Unitarianism; if its believers get tired of trying to work out salvation by their own good works, they very naturally turn towards infidelity, perhaps a little afraid of it, the name at least, but in reality getting towards it.\nHow long I should stay between here & Bellow's Falls I know not, the last week we have stopped here at Brattleboro', This week we shall be at Putney; the next probably at Westminster, and the next perhaps at the Falls.

R.R. for the month of October, and received therefor $20.00 in addition to $14.00 board. Not very great wages, but I do not know as I better complain, it is five dollars or more better than new beginners generally receive. To be sure, I have done more than usual proportion of hard labor, having whenever there was opportunity, gone ahead in any or every laborious matter; and then a considerable part of the time, I have been using instruments & entrusted with business, for which one usually receives about double those wages. But then, I have had an unusually good chance & opportunity for improvement, for learning just the things I want & need to learn. So that it would be better for me by far, even if I received no higher wages, or perhaps even, none at all. However, it will not be long, at this rate before I can set my own wages.

The Head Bookkeeper & Pay Masters of the Corporation are up here, paying off Irishmen &c. &c. by scores. Bills of all kinds for piles & sleepers, & plank & stone, and work & Board, and every thing else. Besides all this Engineers are up from below, with the Conn.

You may imagine that We underlings have to stand round of course. My regular business is of course all interrupted But it will not do for me to get out of the way.

Every cities' taste I believe assigns the Gothic with its pointed arches, its shadowy isles, it high windows, its spires piercing the skies, as the perfection of taste for the Temple of the Christian God. The Romaic with the same general character, the same severe proportions and lofty, heavenly grandeur is equally adapted to the same purpose, with the benefit of greater variety, and greater capacity of adaptedness to different circumstances of time, place, and purpose.  The 'effect' of the Tower of that Church is for me almost entirely unrivalled.\nTontine is a good house.\" is it, indeed? There is a College in the town. You stop at the \"Elm House\" Portland. Is that the Temperance House. The forger? whether it is the \"Elm\" \"U.S.\" or \"American\" is it where I stop. What is the cause of the heavy failure of Jas. Jenkins Co.?\nBut the principal effect with which in vein I took pen at this time, in hand, was to, to scold at you a little. If, as you write, you found yourself delayed in Portland, unable to proceed upon your journey by your usual or proposed route, Why did you not take the Stage leaving Portland for Brunswick twice a day regular? or if you preferred it Charter a \"team\" of some other kind.  You were old enough to know that all things have their value, Gold & Silver, have, so have taters & shingle. You are old enough to know that Bones, Muscles, & health, have also a value you ought to know it. Even I, and I was duller at it than any person claiming common sense ought to be, have learned the lesson. The stage fare from Portland to Brunswick is usually one dollar, never over nine shillings. Suppose it were five dollars or ten. reckon that at its highest value. What is it compared with \"stiff, sore & lame\"  Appraising values any how, a piece of machinery like the human system, with such an Architect. So expensive, so perfectly finished, so nicely adjusted, so unrivalled in its uses, so astonishing in its adaptations; what is it \"worth\"?  How shall be estimated its careless or improper use? Exposure use &c. until its joints dry & the edges irritated, the muscles stretched, stiff hard, & the nerves irritated & worn.

Jan. 12th. 1848.\nDear Brother\nYour last letter was received I believe on New Years Eve. It contained a request that I would answer it about Jan 1st. so as to renew the system. I would gladly have done so, but as I had written you twice within a shortly, I thought it best to wait at least until I obtained some thing to enclose to render it worth the Postage. Said something has been expected daily ever since. it has not yet arrived. Soon afterwards I will endeavor to dispatch this now begun upon sheet.\nSimultaneous with the reception of yours was that of one from Nancy, inviting me to present myself at her Wedding which is to take place tomorrow Eve. That I cannot so do is at present a considerable source of mourning to me. \nI am much obliged to you for the unusual amount of fact on the first page of your letter, namely the incident of your late journey. How does your frozen ear trouble you? How many weeks did it take you to - Outside Creditors are all except a few 'friends perhaps,' specially secured.\nWhatever the other effects of the Lyceum difficulties may be, it has probably benefitted Dr. Pomroy. I do not mean his reputation, for I know nothing of the effect there upon; but it was a good thing to stir him up. Your quotation from Festus just now strikes me. I should not say \"sorrow is the base of all great thoughts. but sorrow is the spur inciting the thought of the Enlarged Mind. L. F. Pomroy D.D. is a large man but for years the even easy tenor of his life has lacked the spur which trouble, vexation, corners, embarrasments - sorrow would give.\nYour remarks upon correspondence are excellent. I have not just now thought enough about me to frame an excuse for my deficiencies. It is very natural, for one constantly occupied with with thoughts of very different things, when trying to write letters, the mind feeling that should be only a change, as an unbending, or relaxation, to write many words and few thoughts.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103136,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103136","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/466347fb81b3bf84246517d518d79acb.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/466347fb81b3bf84246517d518d79acb.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/466347fb81b3bf84246517d518d79acb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/466347fb81b3bf84246517d518d79acb.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:24:10+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:11:37+00:00","filename":"466347fb81b3bf84246517d518d79acb.jpg","authentication":"c33635fccebc7a71d9a480103679fae2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_193_001_002_o2.jpg","size":1767148,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2817,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058084776292089},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033013"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033013"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033013"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"466347fb81b3bf84246517d518d79acb.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812996,"FileSize":1767148,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2817\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2817,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:42:37","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:30:13","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:30:13","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3105,"ExifImageLength":3968,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1284","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"A Quotation in your letter strikes me as not always true.

We do not call them \"bridges.\" They are \"Culverts\" of different kinds \"Arch Culverts\" perhaps; over brooks, roads &c. This is a \"Bridge\" you may call it a stone, iron, or wood.

Feb. 6th 1848\nDear Brother\nOn returning last eve to Northfield, after my peregrinations of the week through forest, fields, and many snows, I found among others, an exceeding letter from thee, with the excellent and much contents of which, my mind for the evening and night being filled, thereto, after the accustomed services of the day & sanctuary, hidden by string most readily and naturally recur. The probability now being that the ensuing week, like its immediate predecessor, will by me spent away from my habitual place of abode, and under such circumstances as to put all thoughts of correspondence at considerable distance from my mind; therefore being seated take I pen in hand.\nVery many matters in thy Epistle are every way worthy of minute attention, and careful, thoughtful reply. Whether I shall have time, opportunity, or ability to give such as they deserve is at best doubtful.\nFirstly, however, let me introduce here that which in glancing at your letter comes first to mind. Did you ever read a Tragedy in five acts, called \"Julius Caesar\" written long time ago by one William Shakespeare, King of English? If so, do you remember the remarks put in the mouth of the Hero of the Tragedy respecting a certain Caius Cassius?

They are the hand writing of him who cannot lie.  This world is not all a gloomy prison house of mind. It is a bright & a beautiful world, full of objects of gratitude and contentment.  To be sure the roses have thorns, and the meadows have thistles & briars, but shall I not enjoy the sweetness of the rose because I may prick my finger with the thorn?  Shall I not walk the meadow because I may, if I go barefoot, hurt my foot with a thistle?  I say it is man's duty to be happy in this world.  He is defeating the designs of God if he is not.  He should, it is true, be careful of the thorns, but he should go confidently forward to gather the roses.\nTo understand Drawing would certainly be great assistance.  A knowledge of perspective must be requisite in drafting buildings especially.  I think I must endeavor to acquire such knowledge, though very many engineers do not.  An engineer is not necessarily a real Draftsman, or a Draftsman an Engineer.\nAs for politics; I \"read the papers\".  As an American I am interested in the political affairs of U.S.A. as a man & a scholar in those of Europe & the world.\nYou say my December prospects seem shaded.  I do not know.  It is hard times to be sure; but others feel it, not I.  I have gone steadily onward in prosperity: my wages, my responsibilities, my prospects constantly increasing and brightening.  My success (spite of Mental Indolence) has been perfect, beyond my expectations or even hopes.\nSat. eve. Feb. 12th.  Well we have got back from Brattleboro.  It has been a very cold week, and people have complained bitterly of the cold. I have been extremely comfortable and laughed at the rest about \"Down East Weather\".  The fact is I am tough.  I have the coldest business too as instrumentalist, standing still about all the time.  The day though I pulled off coat I showed lazy Scamps how to cut trees.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103146,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103146","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/81a5fae84ca0c933fb74d0abdbbf8a37.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/81a5fae84ca0c933fb74d0abdbbf8a37.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/81a5fae84ca0c933fb74d0abdbbf8a37.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/81a5fae84ca0c933fb74d0abdbbf8a37.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:24:22+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:11:37+00:00","filename":"81a5fae84ca0c933fb74d0abdbbf8a37.jpg","authentication":"e40cb6dfed1f3a3df3c8605418992d42","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_193_002_006_o2.jpg","size":1754556,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2843,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057143471294016},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033154"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033154"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033154"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"81a5fae84ca0c933fb74d0abdbbf8a37.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812996,"FileSize":1754556,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2843\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2843,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:43:02","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:31:54","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:31:54","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3189,"ExifImageLength":4037,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1284","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Looking at your letter, I find you ask the difference between 'Alter' & 'Amend'  Have you not such a friend as Old Noah?

M. Metcalf. I think that as a writer you possess considerable merits. Whether you excel most in prose or poetry, I shall not undertake to decide. Your prose writings, as far as I have seen them, certainly exhibit a considerable and very commendable degree both of vigor and excellence of thought, and of correctness and terseness of style. They show also, in my opinion, what, in a young writer, is especially valuable, a capability of improvement. They show a vigorous and well disciplined mind, capable of active thought, and also of acquiring the power or faculty of illustrating and moulding that thought, forming it into those shapes and sounds of strength and beauty which make it truly valuable. \nWhat you  most need appears to me to be a more extended knowledge of general literature, a fuller acquaintance with the most valuable writers. -- a study of them, not merely either as a seeker of thought, of ideas, but an acquaintance with such writings as mediums of thought, as styles. You perhaps lack, in ease & beauty of expression, in aptness and power of illustration. It is not the mere statement of fact or arguments which is especially valuable; it is rather the dressing up, comparing and illustrating those facts and arguments so as to make them not please the ear alone, but excite the attention, while they please the mind, take it captive by a sort of insensible power which -- \nThere I have forgot what I was last writing.

The thought is good, thought should never be sacrificed to rhyme. I have lost my taste for rhyme in a great measure. it should poetry to have a line put in merely to make a rhyme, as is too frequently the case. My taste in these matters is very different now from formerly. It is now only thought & metre I care for. The longest of those pieces I like. Its moral is good, as well as its intellectual, & harmonic.  \"Slaughtered sons,Victims of Janus\" that expression, though it may be strictly correct, would hardly seem so at first to most. Mars has acquired so much notoriety as a War God, that people generally look with distrust upon the pretentions of any other, except it be some old Scandinavian Scamp or other. I believe I like the same verses near the end best of that piece, or part of the long ones before.  One or two line I marked. Leaving out 4 or 5 lines, the long lines with the short ones, and the last 12 for a moral, I like very well.\n\"The Gray Horse\" is quite smooth and pretty, is of that class of poetry where melody & beauty of expression should be sought rather than thought: pleasure rather than instruction, You know too I am in favor of such things.

Would it be similar to that of ?lace? holding? Every one around is obliged to do exactly as the Engineer says. Every thing & every body is at his direction. Here for instance is a contractor who has perhaps hundreds of men at work for him as near slave as they can be, they no more so than he is to the Engineer, and not half so careful or fearful of displeasing him. Here for instance am I, poor as Job's cat often one of the shabbiest looking fellows you see in the street. To be sure (unclear) exactly to my superiors, but hundreds of men perfectly subservient for me. Rich old  contractors, full of money & horses, perfect Nabobs among gentlemen, bound to the very intimation of a will, ready perhaps to go further out of their way to please me than they would to save some of their men's lives. What is the moral effect of this? To make a man imperious, arbitrary, despotic. But there is another view of this case. An engineer has authority in order that he may also have responsibility: and that is to most minds an unpleasant thing. And I am inclined to think that a most usual effect is a sort of dread of exercising authority, knowing how closely it is connected with responsibility.

Second, $20.00 (Fitchburg XX, No 478, E.} with which you may credit me, till I want it. Keep it for me, and if it is worth any thing to you, and you have it long enough to make it worth awhile, allow me interest therefor.  Rather a small way it is these Big Uns take to save a Copper in these hard money times This ninth day of March at Eve I have just received my wages for the month of January.  I suppose they think the interest of $20.00, or even $100.00 for a month or two is not much to any one, but that of the few thousands a Pay Roll would amount to is worth their saving.

Their wages have been very low here for the Winter, and on the first of March they simultaneously, on \"Vt. & Mass.\" \"Conn. River,\" \"Cheshire\" \"Vt. Central\", \"Rutland\" &c. Rail roads stopped work, demanding higher wages. Something of the same kind too I believe in Mane \"Portland & Kennebec\".  If any refuses to join in the \"Strike\" the rest sometimes in bodies of some hundreds marching along the line compel them to stop work, in some cases proceeding to violence and the destruction of property. Many have anticipated trouble here, some among those likely to meet it, arm themselves: but there has been no difficulty and I presume will be none. I was out on the work of Messrs Kinin & Flynn, Sec. 45, over the river, when a considerable party of the \"Paddies\" aforesaid, came over the line and compelled their men, who had kept at work, to quit. They had some scolding among themselves, but none carried weapons of any kind, and all were perfectly civil. They did not even stop the work of the masons who were laying stone on the same Section. \nI am now employed a considerable part of the time at the Big Bridge, at the Connecticut river, where the work is now going on pretty rapidly. I have the general direction of the Pile Driving, and attend to matters and things, so that I am on the works there perhaps half the time. It is a very good chance for me, to set business, and learn to understand thoroughly an important part of my profession.

I am constantly expecting a letter from you, Am tomorrow expecting to go to Brattleboro, for a few days. After my return & reception of your letter, shall probably write as soon as convenient. Just now having leisure moment, & happening to think of it, commence this. One thing - after despatching the letter to which your last of the 20th ult. was in reply. I addressed to you another containing a X.X. Fitchburg. You did not mention the receipt, perhaps it did not reach Bangor until you were gone to Mass, on your journey. It was probably mailed about March 9th. I should perhaps have mentioned it in my last. But it is probably all right somehow.\nI received a day or two since a letter from Sister Lucy, from which I learned that you were then at Milo. The letter contained also a note or two from you, written there. In answer to one question, I am the owner of a very respectable copy of \"Vattel's Law of Nations,' by 'Chitty\". a favorable specimen of the work as used for a Text Book at \"Old Bowdoin.\" I was not intending to sell the Book: although it is rather a costly article; price some $4.00 I think) and is very saleable, at Brunswick at least: I could have sold that for more than it cost me. But I wanted to keep it. However, one Copy of the Work is full as much as you and I both are likely to need for the present: And - you are entirely welcome to the use of it - in fact, I am most happy to have you use it, - until I happen to want it; which, on present appearances, is likely to be not soon.\nYou speak of some of my Books to be sold - You were unfortunate though in the Title you placed at the head of the list - \"Hitchcock's Geology.\" That is a book I bought not because Alma Mater told me to, but because I wanted it. If sold, I should buy again as soon as I could get where it is. I thought it was in my trunk when I came here. and have wanted it twice its worth, but disliked to buy a duplicate, when I could get the first soon.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103158,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103158","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/87ed0e66d62a7b4d5462174a5114fac4.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/87ed0e66d62a7b4d5462174a5114fac4.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/87ed0e66d62a7b4d5462174a5114fac4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/87ed0e66d62a7b4d5462174a5114fac4.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:24:38+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:11:37+00:00","filename":"87ed0e66d62a7b4d5462174a5114fac4.jpg","authentication":"0060071a088ffd3fb5dd47a2da1566f8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_193_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1710632,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2954,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053619448832719},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033356"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033356"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033356"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"87ed0e66d62a7b4d5462174a5114fac4.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812997,"FileSize":1710632,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2954\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2954,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:43:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:33:56","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:33:56","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":67,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3102,"ExifImageLength":3780,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1284","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"As for sale of Books, I intended before I left College, to sell what Books ?page cut off not want, which were saleable: did sell many: left some, French Books to be disposed of by friends. \"Sallustii Opera\" might have shared the same fate. \"Cambridge Mechanics\" I shall want. \"Enfield\" I considered it a duty to sell.

French Revolution. Misery.  Ambition\nYou have never read \"Julius Caesar\". You ought. I believe I once walked unexpectedly in upon you one Sat. Eve , and found you reading a much inferior work of the same author. You remember perhaps abundant extracts from said J Caesar in certain school books. Why are you lean? Do they not keep you well?  Do you not exercise? Do you call a man a good swimmer because he swims every day, or because he has learned to swim and can swim?  Perhaps I better inform you this last sentence refers to disciplined thinking minds.  I should like to drop the subject of \"Mental Indolence.\"  (This may be construed as a perfect submission to your views;  or as \"feeling somewhat sore on that point.  Either  Commonsense = Mental health. Versus Common Sense = Mental Strength.  You say I mean the lowest worse sense of \"National honor\" Show me any better or higher, that really means any thing of the kind.  What good has National honor ever done?  War, pestilence, famine, murder, highway robbery, arson, have done good.  Such a thing as National -purse I can partly understand; Such a thing as National-Pride I can imagine:  National -Conscience I can not even get up an idea of.  I tell you God never created, never designed any other responsibility than individual responsibility, any other conscience than individual conscience.  If there was such a thing what good could it do?  The individual resp. on cons.  has precious little influence over most.  You speak of Reforms.  Take the Temperance Reform.  Did you ever know or hear of a case of reform  influenced clearly by conscience?  If so was it individual or National?    Where is the right to govern? Naturally, perhaps, in the first born, if he is fit for it.  In a system of government instituted directly by God. He had subordinates, those to whom he delegated authority but there was no election, there was hereditary succession in the priesthood the noblest office in the world no representation. Will it not be so in a Millennium?  I am not sure that there is any other right in governments than the \"Divine Right\" . It amounts to that in all forms in the end.  The right to govern was in Oliver Cromwell; and that simply because he was the man capable of doing it.  In that particular I do most fully agree will Carlyle. God in Mercy & Blessing to England, Europe, & the world, called Oliver to the throne of England.  No man ever set on that throne by a higher or a more legitimate authority;  was ever less an usurper.  Is the authority of the Pres. U.S. any better than that of Nicholas? Does it not come from the same source, but by a much more round about course.  For my part, I am not perfectly fixed yet upon this point, the favorite & according to some the fundamental idea of Republicans; upon the right any more than the ability of \"the people\" to govern themselves.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103160,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103160","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/a906f26f8adcea3c4f8a78b3472154a5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/a906f26f8adcea3c4f8a78b3472154a5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/a906f26f8adcea3c4f8a78b3472154a5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a906f26f8adcea3c4f8a78b3472154a5.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:24:40+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:11:37+00:00","filename":"a906f26f8adcea3c4f8a78b3472154a5.jpg","authentication":"83ba6f66d2d757a3f8be1e04b3c73592","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_193_005_002_o2.jpg","size":1549881,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2305,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.062259219088937},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033412"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033412"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033412"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a906f26f8adcea3c4f8a78b3472154a5.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812997,"FileSize":1549881,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2305\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2305,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:43:36","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:34:12","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:34:12","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3211,"ExifImageLength":5013,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1284","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"It is, and it must even be the favorite, in fact the one essential dogma of Demagogues.  But I am a good deal inclined to believe, with their opponents, that such an origin and  sanction of government is not really at heart, recognized by such men & minds as Vinton and Webster, and Marsh, and Evans, any more than it is by the master minds of other countries or other times.  The older & the wiser a statesman grows, the more he thinks perhaps, the less hold this idea has upon him.  A really great mind may be  radical in youth, may be democratic in early maturity, but as true as truth & honesty influence it, age, wisdom, &  experience will make it conservative.  I have considered Guizot as one of the greatest & wisest and also one of the very best statesmen that Europe has ever produced; probably the very first in his own country. He was too the very \"embodiment\" we might say, of the enlightened liberal, constitutional, principles of France, the principles of Lafayette;  Republican principles . Yet this same Guizot taught ( as one may suppose) as La Fayette was, by much wisdom and hard experience, how utterly incapable the people, French people, were of governing themselves aright, and patriot like, endeavoring, for their good, to guide and govern them properly, was the one against whom the present French Revolution appears principally to be directed.  I must doubt whether the French will soon see as good a government again What the result of this Revolution is like to be, I cannot really decide in my mind. \nWith the character of one man I do not understand fully.  With Odillon Barrot.  Webster's Rhode Island argument, I have not read: have you?  You call it a \"mere lawyers plea\" and \"flimsy\".  It may be so.  But it was certainly a very important case; and one of the greatest subjects he, or any one else, ever spoke upon.  I do not judge him a man to be \"flimsy\" on such an occasion.  Moreover, if that did not influence the court something else did.  The U.S. Supreme Court perhaps the grandest judicial tribunal in the world Full Bench  Taney, Woodbury, & all, previously disposed to the contrary, I believe decided in favor of his side, mangre the days or weeks of argument, fact, precedent or what not, brought forward by the opposing counsel.  I repeat it sunshine & summer scenes are \"true pictures.  That the man may laugh or frown tomorrow or next week, and thus for a moment after his appearance does not make his Dagueotype likeness of today an untrue picture.  But let me quote Authorities for you - \"The misery of man appears like childish petulance when we explore the steady & prodigal provision that has been made for his support & delight on this green ball which floats him through the heavens.  That angels invented these splendid ornaments, these rich conveniences, this ocean of air above, this ocean of water beneath, this firmament of earth between?  this zodiac of lights, this tent of dropping clouds, this striped coat of climates, this fourfold year?  Beasts, fire, water, stones & corn to serve him.  The field at once his floor his workyard, his playground, his garden & his bed.\"  So says a book I am this eve reading.  The same author directs - \" If a man would be alone let him look at the stars.\"  Think of that.  In another place he - \"If the stars should appear only one night in a thousand years \"&c.\". What a sight.  \"How would men believe and adore!  and preserve for generations the remembrance of the City of God which had been shown! The same writer being somewhat inclined to trancendentalism, affirms. \" Most people do not see the Sun.\"  To be sure he afterwards qualifies the expression.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103161,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103161","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/9668c2fbfae572c5b7819004de863074.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/9668c2fbfae572c5b7819004de863074.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/9668c2fbfae572c5b7819004de863074.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9668c2fbfae572c5b7819004de863074.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:24:41+00:00","modified":"2020-10-05T19:11:37+00:00","filename":"9668c2fbfae572c5b7819004de863074.jpg","authentication":"7729b6405e72fe0921888f61fecac5bc","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_193_005_003_o2.jpg","size":1514145,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2282,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.061436727042555},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033415"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033415"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033415"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"9668c2fbfae572c5b7819004de863074.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812997,"FileSize":1514145,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2282\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2282,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:43:39","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:34:15","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:34:15","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":91,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3166,"ExifImageLength":4993,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1284","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"you enquire if I am informed in European Politics.  Well -some-after my\nfashion.  My information has been derived heretofore principally, while in College\nfrom the Reviews, the British Quarterlies, you know &c.  My knowledge of Am\n\"politics\" has for a few years also been founded principally upon the American Reviews,\nthe \"North American\" the \"Whig\" and \"Democratic\" Reviews.  These Reviews I regard\nas extremely valuable, not only as being the best mirrors of politics: reflecting it in perhaps its best state,\nbut in what may be called its \"transition\" state,  from believer the state of mere news, in which of course it has\nlittle value, to the state of history: but also as being the most true & sensible exponents of the views &\nsentiments of the parties whose organs they are.  It is certainly the case in regard to the great\nEuropean Reviews; and I believe also in great, measure, with the \"Whig\" & Democratic.\"\nOf course there can little reliance be placed upon the mere partisan newspapers of either party.\nThey are worth reading merely for the news of the day or week: not as exponents of real sentiment.\nThese Reviews seem to me about as much necessaries of literary life, as bread & meat of the physical.\nThe very idea of being so poor as to be compelled to do without them would seem to bar me from a \nprofessional life.  since I came here, in default of Reviews & everything else, I take H Greeleys\n\"New York Tribune\", perhaps the best substitute, as far as Foreign politics are concerned.\nIt also suffices to keep me comfortably informed of congressional proceedings & domestic affairs.\nYour definition of History is a good one, as far as \"politics\" is every thing, for that\nin the first tense in history. \"An Aristocrat is but a democrat ripe & gone to seed\" is\nextremely true.  Extremes are frequently close together, but their true opposite is the mean not\neach other.  I have been ardently democratic & aristocratic, a great change or revulsion of\nfeeling has some over me; I do not know but I am getting prematurely old, but I am\nbecoming much conservative, republican, constitutionalist.\nPresent appearances are extremely unfavorable to Metternich, and to Austrian policy\nand self continuance.

But, the\ntruth is knowledge of fact is not really the most important knowledge; to be sure certain proportion, a limited number of facts\nis somewhat necessary in all professions & occupations; perhaps more as required for an Engineer\nor a Financier, that for an other man.  Beyond this limit a fool may know more facts\nthan a philosopher. \"Yet\", the utilitarian may say \"it is very convenient\"  Yes- so is an Encyclopedia\nbut it is rather a poor use to put a man to make him one; or a table of Logarithms either\nWhy perhaps you know half a dozen times as many facts now as I do: but it does not prove you are\nthe best educated.

I rather think if I had plenty of Big Goods around\nme to consult, \"Authorities,\" I could find the facts and establish it.\nFor your account of your journeyings I was very much obliged.  Such a trip must be n many accounts a truly\npleasant.  I think you must have enjoyed it a good deal.  Was it principally for business or for pleasure?\nYou mentioned nothing that your objects were, or what you were about in the different places you visited.\nHow much would your expenses arrange per diem during such a trip. $3 to 5 probably travelling expenses &\nafter I believe my expenses were about $30 last winter in a six days trip to New Haven.\nProvidence I have never seen.  The arcade which you mentioned, I have read & seen engravings of.  A more particular\ndescription of places & objects, and recital of incidents would have been extremely interesting.\nAs for the Blues or Hypochondria - I enjoy perfect health.  To be sure I may not feel quite so well at some\ntimes as at others, but then my complexion never depends in any great degree upon that of the atmosphere or that\nof my dinner.

To be sure no one can help having some certain aspirations; - and now I think of it\nperhaps it is only sluggishness of soul, that one has formed or even established the habit of not being more\nthereby.  However, I believe our philosophies approve the wisdom of discarding ambition.  In fact though\nI do regard it as every ones duty to rise, to use as much as fact & as far as possible, that is without\nsacrificing anything else for it.  Not a mere ill in wealth: of itself is worth little or nothing.\nto elevate ones position in society, if it be the right kind of society, is worth more.  To increase in\nwisdom, true wisdom, and in happiness, that is the great thing.  To increase oneself, not his\nproperty or his standing, or any of those mere accidents: to increase the man himself.\nThose ambitious men, most men, perhaps all men, fail, err more or less is in buying\nthings too dear, terrible mean dirty  paltry things too they pay prices for.\nScripture speaks of the folly of selling the soul for the whole world, yet how many lose it for really\nless than nothing?  how many for a few petty grains of glittering dust, which in the end only burns their\nfingers and corrodes their hearts?  What object of ambition is wroth purchasing at the expense\nor the risk of peace of conscience?  Or even at the expense of social enjoyments, and the happiness\nGod has designed and ordered that we should enjoy even in this world?\nYou say \"the road is open, the means at hand, they may be discerned\"  I wish if you see & understand#\nthem you would state & explain.  Likely enough, after all my preaching & practice too, I have only been\nin the condition of the fox under the grape vines: and should like to climb up \"a piece\", to wobble\n\"less a little\" if it did not cost too much.  Finally I agree with you pretty well, that we\nare rather a smart set of fellows.  I doubt you sometimes thing though more better more smarter and might get\na cog or two higher, Providence resisting, if we tried hard enough.  only see that the whistle\ndoes not cost too much: or not to pay the piper too much to dance.\nYou mention where you go to hear preaching in Boston.

Russian is much more harsh.\nI do certainly & really think of going to Milo in May:  tell them here I am going whether\nor no.  To be sure it is rather a different business for one to leave a load during constructive for\na week or fortnight:  but if they let me go, I shall run no risk of losing my place.  I believe\nI got a pretty firm hold here, considering especially the comparatively short term of my service.\nMarriage - \"the most important of worldly subjects\" - I believe I am not disposed to\ntrifle with the subject.  Of course, I think of the matter - if I think of anything.\nI think I am unfortunately not exactly just in proper condition to get married at present,\nprobably not so well situated for it as my brothers, and moreover do not as yet know\nany person in all respects just what I should wish in a person for me to marry.

To the stock of that Road taken up; How do Bangor men feel about it, Who are leading Capitalists, & the Engineers.\nAre you aware that awarding the palm of Elegance to Rufus Choate in preference to H B. Sargent, is probably blankly denying all your fire spun theories of Eloquence in one of your later letters. You did not hesitate quite enough.\nI never said I never read Jeremy Bentham, I guess. I never did much  though. I have looked over some. What you call my \"prejudices\" may however be derived from better sources, than either his own or the injuriously worthless writings of some of his diciples in this country which I have read, While I think of it, Did you ever read the life of that same Jeremy Bentham? Better. He was undoubtedly a man of powerful mind. probably too of great heart though awfully warped, as a powerful mind he has undoubtedly had great influence, but in my opinions very far from beneficial influence.\nThe mans' character was fundamentally wrong. his foundation & starting point wrong. Systems however ingenius, however powerfully supported, must fail in the end as Bentham's have done, if founded upon & built with principle directly opposed to the foundation principles of Christianity. The principles of Christianity must be foundation even of the politics of this world. History proves it.

I am short for this light paper Your excellent letter was joyfully received a few days since. If the postmark was correct however, it had been out of the way somewhere. A week in the South Following your plan of affording suitable precedence to the jib that time may be found to ship shape the stem sheets, I have begun this today. \nTo recur once more to the subject of Eloquence. I can hardly allow that you have fairly got round my question as to Sargent & Choate. At least you have not given sufficient authority consistent with your previous theories, or statements for preferring Choate on Eloquence\nChoate is undoubtedly one of the possible the most eloquent men in the country \"as most men count eloquence\". But if you have heard Choate, I appeal to you; if his greatness is not in what you characterized as \"\"spurious mock eloquence\" \"Instead of strict truths or treats them as such; facile, agile, rapid in sophistry, rather that rapid in sound reasoning. Impetuosity and a sort of bold & confident audacity in asserting things unformed and uncertain as truth; and deducting principles and inferences in all sorts of ways & from all sorts of premises, are characteristics of his tactics\" Why you made out a fine description of Choate's speaking; in fact of all popular & successful eloquence is usually precisely of this sort. In fact; if all these - if what you perhaps call \"Balony\" is not eloquence; and as I judge you mean, Truth, Candor, & Zeal, are its true essentials. I cannot yet see that you have not set yourself the other side up in awarding the palm of eloquence; to Choate, in preference to H.B. Sargent or Isaiah Rider\nHowever; Some of your ideas would find themselves approved by the great standard work on this head; viz. \"Cicero de Orator\". (of the orator). Which if your attention is bestowed upon this subject, you ought to read.

It is unfortunate; with a heart not lacking in sympathy; somewhat susceptible to the influence of other mind: frequently some what influenced by certain minds: I never yet happened to meet that mind exactly the right one to absorb & carry away my own. If I had I might have been a different, a superior man. I can realize it to be so.  To be sure, I never thought much about the subject; too careless on that as on others.  if I do think - what shall I do? How effect any thing? What can a young man do?   Really I begin to fear, now I think of it, that I am one of those unfortunate beings predestined by unpropitious circumstance to be an - Old Bach.  You used to argue Early Marriages. You seem to be quitting the ground as untenable.  Now I think of it - I begin to be strongly to that opinion.

McKeen Esq.\n\nNorthfield, Mass  Aug 9th 1848\nMr McKeen     Dear Sir\nYour letter and statement of my account is duly received. I notice that the extra charge in my first term bill ^$26.25, for which I petitioned an abatement is continued. This charge,  acknowledged an unreasonable one. I had not expected to pay and Rev Woods gave me encouragement that it would be remedied. There are also some other things in the account which I do not understand. E.g. the balance of $.81 at the close of the year 1845. But though differing from my memoranda, I presume your books are correct.  In the Bill for the Spring Term of '47 there is charged $3.18 for \"Repairs.\"  I was in College but about one week that term. It seems hardly fair when one is absent in addition to all the other charges as usual, to be taxed for repairs because the room one had occupied was broken in and his own books & other property removed or stolen. Another thing I mentioned to you last year. I had furnished my room with an Airtight Stove at expense of $4.00. During my absence in Spring of '47 my stove was removed with the others. When I enquired for it you told me it should be returned or I should be paid for it. The Term Bill of Dec 18th 1846, and of Dec. 19th, '45, as also the last one of Sept '47 I have never seen. If you have them by you & it is convenient, I will be much obliged to you if you will forward them to me by Mail as I should like to see them, especially the last.    &c.\n\n This is the letter, which, I judge from the extract you wrote of one to you, Mr McK considered offensive. The above is a copy of my first rough draft of it \"probably under some excitement\" If the epistle sent varied from that, it was in softening down the \"Tone\" of it; which I think was done in some degree the next day. If offensive in any degree it must be by its simple Truth.  The $.81 of 1845 I considered an extremely delicate allusion to Mr. McK's peculiar method of reckoning interest Triennially. It would be instantly understood by him. Any impression is however that that passage was considerably 'refined' in the copy sent.\n\nNorthfield, Mass. Aug 28th, 1848.\nMr McKees   Dear Sir\n\nI am extremely sorry to be obliged to apologize for again delaying the settlement of my account with Bowd. Coll.

Right of governing. Marriage. Radical difference in the sexes. Metcalf arms. Heraldry. Is it a sin to have great wealth.\nNorthfield Aug. 20th 1848\nDear Brother.\nYour last letter was duly received, and as usual contained many things of worth & meriting reply. As for the money business upon which you wrote the case is bad. You see I owed Bowd. Coll, and did not pay; not having given bonds they had no alternative but to wait. I hated terribly to leave College without paying up. Honor requires that if I could not then I should as soon as possible. Not thinking of trouble, I wrote to Old McKeen, apologizing as handsomely as I could for running off with my bills unsettled, requesting statement of account, and promising to send it by 1st Prox. He has replied very kindly, and hoping it would be settled in time for his Annual Account, so he could report me for a degree. I do not like to put it off any longer. Still, you are in straightened circumstances, and it would probably trouble you much more to raise the money than it would all be worth. After all I guess it will not make much difference. I will write once more to Mr. McKeen, apologize the best I know, tell him perhaps, that I had invested the funds for that object where I supposed them at Command, but that the present financial crisis has taken them out of my power, & I have no means left but to wait a month or two until I can again earn the money.\nI suppose I should send him about a hundred dollars. Now I expected to receive more than that of Vt.&Mass. R.R.

As for the dexter falcon, either the 'scutcheon is too small or my pen is too big, & I will give it up, Moreover I guess I will do the same by the crest, which would be much harder to delineate than escutcheon. besides I hardly understand it. falcon rising is plain;  or, dotted to express gold; wing asure, expressed by image of 9 lines on top of each other am or star on each wing? charged in the neck with a bar gemmels of the second. I do not fully understand What is it which is charged with a bar? \"gemmels\" I do not know. gemel in an aldic. term meaning double, or a pair I believe\nYou ask me to \"blason\" that coat of arms: by which I suppose you mean explain it; perhaps that is just what I do not know. However in the first place, you have not half described it, I judge. You have not blasoned it much yourself. As for its meaning intended , if that you want: I will not undertake to say whether or not the original wearer did not live in a shed house! falcons perhaps mean courage & strength, or some of that ilk: or perhaps renown in hunting. The crest was quite a mark of distinction sometime perhaps. The colors of the family which those are the arms are about as much as I should know from it.   You say I have advantages which you have not for study of Heraldry. The contrary is true. I have had. I am not where I have access to books, as much as you. Go into your Library,  consult some of those big old Encyclopedias, articles \"Heraldry\" etc. By the way those Old Encyclopedias are the most valuable things in Libraries. Do you ever know their value, for reference. If there is any thing in the world you want to know about all you have to do is open some one of those Encyclopedias. For Heraldry etc. I guess Encyclopedia Brittanica is  the thing; am not quite certain. How well is your library supplied with that sort?\n\n             Here is an idea I just have, from Prov. Phil. \"He who hath more than enough is a theif of the rights of his brother\" Is that a fact? Is it a sin for a man to have a hundred thousand dollars? I believe it is! What right or title has he to it when thousands of his fellows have not food, clothing & education?  I am not sure that those French Blouse men are not mainly in the right, after all.

He is a man perhaps 35 years old, with an excellent wife, and two pretty children, intelligent, well informed, of the highest toned principle; has been a Country Merchant, farmer, and buyer of Cattle, has quite a pretty little property; Asschson's books, I think say $5000.00 at interest; perhaps the man is worth 10.000, perhaps 30.000.00; never asked him.

As it is, it can hardly be duty for him to stay in Purgatory for the sake of benefitting that which is past all hope.

What relative of Michael Metcalf who settled in Dedham in 1637 or 8, was Eleasar Metcalf who went or returned to Wrentham in 1680 or thereabout. his name was first on the list of Town's men.\n\nDo you know any thing about Judge Theron Metcalf?\nIs Senator Metcalf of Kentucky a Wrentham Metcalf?\nJudge Metcalf of Natchez Miss. I believe is.\nIs there any such thing as Town Records of those old Towns of some 150 or 200 years ago? Do you know any thing of that great Type man Metcalf of Boston, come from Monmouth, Maine? Who is that Metcalf (Benj?) who used to live in Bangor, a few years since?\n\n What is probably the value of \"History of Dedham\", from the beginning of its settlement in Sept. 1635 to May 1827, by Erastus Worthington? Also \"Historical Address\" with notes\" of Sam'l F. Haven Esq. Sec. Gen. Ann. of Dedham, 1836?\n More than thirty funerals in the Town of Northfield since July 1st. about three times the usual Annual number! I never knew before that Dysentery was so dreadful a disease; though it cut down a Noble College friend of mine a year since. I never knew what a disease it was. \n What do you think of the Asiatic Cholera? I see the London Physicians have begun to expect it there. Will it not be in this country by another Season? Are not the Bowel Complaints, so prevalent, this season, its natural premonitions?","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103189,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103189","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e97b364aec331ee6a7edcaffa9b16984.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e97b364aec331ee6a7edcaffa9b16984.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e97b364aec331ee6a7edcaffa9b16984.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e97b364aec331ee6a7edcaffa9b16984.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:25:18+00:00","modified":"2020-10-06T01:29:14+00:00","filename":"e97b364aec331ee6a7edcaffa9b16984.jpg","authentication":"6772268cb3316c36d2d53fa82b0e1287","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_193_012_001_o2.jpg","size":1646679,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2831,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053857392362338},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033746"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033746"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033746"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e97b364aec331ee6a7edcaffa9b16984.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812998,"FileSize":1646679,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2831\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2831,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:44:48","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:37:46","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:37:46","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3155,"ExifImageLength":4011,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1284","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Sep 18 1858\n\nDear Brother Joseph\n\n I wrote you quite a letter the other day I guess in advance; though I do not know as there was really any thing worth awhile in it: And I do not know as I have any thing particular to write now: bit then I want to write to some of them and you seem to be the general convenient medium.

R.R. some seven or eight miles from here; which occupation is mine at present; and I am therefore obliged, being on the track early & late to board away from home, & only come up here Saturday nights.

You know they were burnt out last Spring; the loss fell most heavily on Joseph. Parsons had much other property; but it was almost Joseph's all. He thought he had not capital money enough to continue the business profitably; and now wants some other; may get some situation, Depot, Freight, or Baggage, Master or something on the Rail Road. Is helping us for a few weeks now driving grade pegs.\n    You enquire for the origin of a quotation in my last letter on the Source of Government. I have been trying to remember what the quotation was, but cannot, much more where it came from. Since then have happened to meet with Wm Goodell's Constitutionality of Am. Slavery. Did you ever see the Book? Am very much pleased with some things there, some that tally so exactly with certain ideas of my own which I have never before seen well expressed. \"Common Law\" So, He does not show much money too, to the celebrated \"Social Compact.\"","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103194,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103194","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5cdc84c35fcbb20c7744b5694e33c326.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5cdc84c35fcbb20c7744b5694e33c326.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5cdc84c35fcbb20c7744b5694e33c326.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5cdc84c35fcbb20c7744b5694e33c326.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:25:25+00:00","modified":"2020-10-06T02:41:12+00:00","filename":"5cdc84c35fcbb20c7744b5694e33c326.jpg","authentication":"eeadfb8ad4cbb09c56267e758a46a430","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_193_013_002_o2.jpg","size":1622424,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2871,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.052324780370757},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033815"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033815"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033815"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5cdc84c35fcbb20c7744b5694e33c326.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812999,"FileSize":1622424,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2871\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2871,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:45:00","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:38:15","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:38:15","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":42,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3161,"ExifImageLength":3963,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1284","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I expect I do not fully understand your method for me to remit money to Mr. Keen, supposing you to have the funds ready to pay over to him, am I simply to route and send to him a check, draft, or whatever you call it, similar to the sample you sent?

I rather think from McClures' \"Christian Observatory\", a monthly usually lent me by my friend Dea. Dutton.  It sounds much like McClure's own style.  Some piece I read there some way connected with that subject I recommember.\nAs much obliged for your information with regard to forwarding money etc.  I have been quite anxious to settle up the business this month.  We get no money yet though.  I have been obliged to borrow considerable, thirty or forty dollars round.  When it will come know not; strongly hope this week.  It is certainly time -- most four months behind  The Vt. & Mass. is terribly pressed, pretty fairly covered.  Wiggled terribly for a few months.  First 90 per cent Bonds then New Stock at half price!  Now finally probably a Loan and Mortgage of Road, is being successful.\nYou speak of laying sticks on the Atlantic & St. Lawrence R.R. the trouble is I have no sticks in that direction; not even a peg to hang a hat or a hope on.

To you, I expect one ought to write something besides of the \"actual\"; perhaps something to \"expose & undermine that solid falsehood, the Material\" \nI believe however I happen too have no ideas of my own, I must go to your letter, for some, I guess \nQuestion, quotation from Prov. Phil. I do believe in it and I hardly know how much. Neither can I tell how much of superstition, or how much of philosophy is mingled with my faith. The idea of the \"context\" is perhaps that things may become so familiar to the imagination as to seem familiar to the senses. One may read & think so much of Palmyra, Rome or Niagara, that when at last visiting them, their very scenes seem familiar. That & much more is mere philosophy, the philosophy of the imagination the other that some would call mere superstition, may be only the same imagination will further carried out, and more mixed up of Memory & imagination together. Farther than this I hardly know as I would do to go much far. lest we get out of the world & no philosophy into some new world of Mesmerism or some kindred affair. By the way there are projects I hardly dare to look into.

Did you ever see a yellow dog?  one of the true foolblooded Yallers?\nWell, I am not going to California.  There is no need of it.  It's all a humbug.  I haven't got to get a yaller dog to carry to the mint either.  I believe I shall go myself though.  How many half eagles will 165 lbs good weight without boots or hair make?  There are all sorts of folks here at our City of Grouts, and I find it perfectly safe to keep my door locked a nights lately, lest some of 'em should turn \"Gold Hunters\", and clip off \"the Engineer's\" fingers or toes for yellow boys.\nDid you ever see any one who had the Jaundice -- the real \"yaller jaunders\"  Well I have been just so afflicted in the hardest kind and it is quite a serious business I assure you.  It is quite a rare disease, commonly at most, occasional only in the Spring.  But there seems to be some thing peculiar in this miserable abominable little Millers River upon whose shores I am condemned to dwell; perhaps also in the season  \nAt any rate the disease is extremely prevalent here, all along our Vt. & Mass. R.R. line, and I have had it the very worst kind.  As I understand it the Gall overflows and runs all over the system.  The \"victim\" becomes dull and stupid, almost lifeless, sleepy -- why I could sleep 18 or 20 hours out of the 24.  Yellow as saffron; no life left but Nausea.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103204,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103204","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5258022c07bc05c0e513c1448cfdb644.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5258022c07bc05c0e513c1448cfdb644.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5258022c07bc05c0e513c1448cfdb644.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5258022c07bc05c0e513c1448cfdb644.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:25:38+00:00","modified":"2020-10-06T03:13:36+00:00","filename":"5258022c07bc05c0e513c1448cfdb644.jpg","authentication":"c391b67a86513fe492b64239b2a1978f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_193_016_002_o2.jpg","size":1878738,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2844,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.061166393186435},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033923"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033923"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["033923"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5258022c07bc05c0e513c1448cfdb644.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812999,"FileSize":1878738,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2844\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2844,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:45:26","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:39:23","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:39:23","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3169,"ExifImageLength":4011,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1284","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The first week in December I was so busied & hurried with estimates etc. that I did not know any thing about it, as it was coming on.

Eve. Feb. 24th, 1849\n\nDear Brother Your letter was received quite lately, I have been extremely busy lately and my correspondence is sadly behindhind, but as you are invalided and a letter may aid in consoling you, I will try to write a bit this evening. By the way your letter was strangely delayed on the road; mailed the 16th & arrived at Grouts from the West on the 23!  It is sometime since I have been wanting to write to Lucy & Milo, as well as Eliab & have not got a chance yet.\n\nIn reply to your letter, I must first observe that your comparisons betray an abominable lack of correct knowledge of scripture history. It is years since I read \"the connection\" but I venture to affirm that Asahel, though \"swift of foot as a wild roe\", was not \"the Son of Jesse\" as you insinuate. Beware of \"parvartin the scriptur.\" Asahel was the Son of Zeruiah, and brother of Joab & Abishai, and was smitten by Abner the son of Ner, under the fifth rib, after due warning, as he \"followed hard after him\", without his harness.\n\nSecondly, that business have you to be sick, especially to have the \"palsy & the rheumatism.\"? Moreover I do not believe in Blisters, Strychnia, Ammonia, and all that class of remedies. I should be afraid of them. I should prefer \"Alterative\" of quite different sort. If you have been much in habit of Cold bathing, that alone would not be the effectual thing. Change; quit that: Try copious, abundant warm bathing or hot bathing; with also free & copious evacuations, either Lobelia Emetics, or else Thorough Purgatives. MS's might say Calomel. I should prefer Rhubarb or something similar. Such is my theory. Still I do not know but I should prefer to consult & even follow prescriptions of really superior educated, scientific Physicians. There is something prevalent here.  You know it was a very sickly season, every one sick. Dysentery etc. kindred diseases. These diseases left very many with sorts of Chronic Rheumatism: sciatica or something. for months many have not yet recovered from the effects, the dregs of their last summer's ills.\n\n Are you really acquainted with chess? Pity you had not someone to play with you.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103212,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103212","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/94148ead0ef93912c0ad2b521d8a86b7.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/94148ead0ef93912c0ad2b521d8a86b7.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/94148ead0ef93912c0ad2b521d8a86b7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/94148ead0ef93912c0ad2b521d8a86b7.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:25:49+00:00","modified":"2020-10-06T19:18:30+00:00","filename":"94148ead0ef93912c0ad2b521d8a86b7.jpg","authentication":"a346a041fa543650aa676029b73d22b8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_194_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1873559,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2860,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.060656533281533},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034038"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034038"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034038"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"94148ead0ef93912c0ad2b521d8a86b7.jpg","FileDateTime":1595812999,"FileSize":1873559,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2860\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2860,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:45:48","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:40:38","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:40:38","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3130,"ExifImageLength":3939,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1284","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"You do misuse that old before mentioned German. Can it really be I, - matter of fact, common sense, 'practical man', as I am, should be 'Trancendentalist' An Engineer too, the most practical of all human employments - impossible. Why, if I have one spark of Trancendentalism about me, I am certainly very much out of place in my present profession & employment. At any rate, as I said before, I am not a Metaphysician. As for \"the Ludicrous\" Hobbes definition of it is certainly to me at least most trancendentally of ununderstandably Ludicrous.\n\n My experience of 'Mysteries' too had been very much inferior to yours. I do not know as I ever saw any more in want of an explanation than some Mathematical problem or Diagram. Your argument in explanation of Mysteries is so overburdened with Metaphysics that I hardly understand it all in the 'premise.' the 'Conclusion' I judge lacks Mathematics; requires more Permutation & Combination.\n\nHowever, I should judge it a strong argument, but rather misapplied, when addressed to an Engineer!

Your explanation is certainly rather crude. If the Earth was in the habit of freezing one hundred times as much as it now does, and water froze no easier then at present, it might be possible for the frost to burrow under the beds of rivers and coming up freeze the stones etc., and make ice stick to them, but it would hardly be anchor ice even then. But that could not happen under the present dispensation. Your illustration also is unfortunate. We have no such thing as \"Gunter's Chain\". We use a hundred foot Chain with foot links. The Contractors also belong to the \"Crowbar\". Moreover the ice or cold iron thrown into water would be not anchored but adhering and to flatten you clear out, it  would all melt off in fifteen minutes!\nAnchor ice is not froze on to the bottom. but lies there because it is heavier than water. It looks & feels most like snow lying on the bottom. but examined you see that it is composed of minute atoms of ice,  pure crystalized Water dropped together there simply by its own gravity. The question is, and returns how comes it by this strange, unaccountable, all at once, gravity, so apparently contrary to all reason & nature?\nR.R. Sleepers, or CrossTies. Cedar I know nothing of, except that I should suppose it would be best; it is not found in this region at all. Chestnut is used almost altogether here, it is perhaps the most common wood in all this region. Where Chestnut is not so very abundant Oak is very much used. On Vt. & Mass., we use for dimension 7 1\/2 feet long, \"6 infill & 6 in face\". That is -- You know they are generally hewed or sawed on two opposite sides of faces. 6 in \"fill\" is required or thickness between these faces. \"6 in face\" or width of the hewed or flat side, though if the stick is big enough sides enough, less than 6 in face in spots is accepted. Some roads lay 7 ft long sleepers, in fact we have miles here. I do not know but it is so good. On various of our cognate Railroads, the rule is \"7 in fill, 5 in face,\" instead of ours \"6 in fill 6 in face\".\nPrice, Various, dependent upon abundance & convenience of Timber to the point of delivery.

Stormy Morning\n\nDear Brother Joseph\n\n                 I believe I wrote last week to inform you that, contrary to my expectations of a week since, I have not yet reached Bangor. Where I really am, is perhaps a more difficult matter to affirm positively.\n\nAbout as much as I know is that I am on the Line of a New RailRoad, to be called the \"New Hampshire Central Rail Road\" designed to extend from the City of Manchester clear across the State to Winsor, Vermont. Twenty five miles of it, or as far as Henniker, is to be built this Season.\n\n  Witness the uncertainty & vanity of human expectations, One week since, I expected to visit before this time, Worcester, Woonsocket, Boston, Portsmouth, Portland, Bangor, Home, and Friends. Turned out of my course, the first day, I reached Boston instead of Worcester. The next day the city of Manchester. Then I thought I would take stage across the country through Epping, where I have a particular friend to Exeter, there to take the R.R. but being too late for the Stage that day I got lost on the other side, and here I am.\n  I did intend to deliver some \"funds\" to you for safe keeping. Since the first of February I have received nearly $300.00 Some of it was due, I spent some. I believe I sent $40.00 to you, or to Eliab for you. I did intend to carry home $100.00. but I spent $40. or 50. for clothing $18. for a New Trunk, $10 or 20. for Mathematical and Engineering Instruments: some for books and c. etc. besides \"current expenses\"; until there is not much left","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103216,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103216","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ba7ba3f0fb30ffef8b227ddf2aec72ca.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ba7ba3f0fb30ffef8b227ddf2aec72ca.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ba7ba3f0fb30ffef8b227ddf2aec72ca.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ba7ba3f0fb30ffef8b227ddf2aec72ca.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:25:54+00:00","modified":"2020-10-06T21:34:22+00:00","filename":"ba7ba3f0fb30ffef8b227ddf2aec72ca.jpg","authentication":"df22fb483917e2bb78da1e21440edd2f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_194_003_002_o2.jpg","size":1561757,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2806,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051534971357673},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034105"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034105"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034105"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ba7ba3f0fb30ffef8b227ddf2aec72ca.jpg","FileDateTime":1595813000,"FileSize":1561757,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2806\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2806,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:45:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:41:05","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:41:05","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3123,"ExifImageLength":4006,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1284","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"However, I am earning more.

April 8th 1849\n\nDear Brother Joseph    Your last letter dated Milo, March 8th has finally been received. It was mailed at Bangor, I suppose, received in due course of Mail at Grouts. Remailed there, March 20thm for Bangor, there remailed again, March 29th for Goffstown. N.H. and finally brought to me in War N.H. April 2d or 3d. Went the rounds.\nEliab hardly knew what to think when he found Letters found Letters for me in the Bangor Post Office, Mailed from Grouts! before any one there suspected I had left Grouts.\n\n I am just now in an extreme quandary. I have very unexpectedly got a situation here on the New Hampshire Central Rail Road. Mr. Chase, the Chief Engineer likes me; put all confidence in me, Offers to do very well by me; and is very anxious I should stay.  I have just begun to get a good deal intoxicated in the Line, getting acquainted with the people & I like the Country and the stopping places. Every thing much preferable to my places in Mass. and cheaper too. Moreover, it is a Long Route, Only twenty five miles of it is to be built this season, but the road will undoubted eventually extend clear across the State to Winsor, Vermont. This will make quite a job of it, and if I am fortunate & satisfactory it may be quite a permanent situation. I hate badly to just begin any thing & then quit. The beginning  is all the disagreeable. That is one horn of the dilemma, and certainly very plausible. The other is this. Mr. A.R. Field, my old Vt. & Mass. Superior, with whom I have always been, and who has always done every thing in his power for me & helped me forward all he could; and  whose eulogistic recommendation procured me this situation.~ This Mr. Field Esq. has just been appointed to the charge of the \"Ashuelot R.R.\" from Keene to Winchester N.H. 15 Mls.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103220,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103220","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/a378a221f51a962d1a0ce8b7804ccd01.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/a378a221f51a962d1a0ce8b7804ccd01.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/a378a221f51a962d1a0ce8b7804ccd01.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a378a221f51a962d1a0ce8b7804ccd01.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:25:59+00:00","modified":"2020-10-06T23:00:49+00:00","filename":"a378a221f51a962d1a0ce8b7804ccd01.jpg","authentication":"c95e2ce52b5bc815a24c1a594dbef498","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_194_004_002_o2.jpg","size":1801995,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2839,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.058771183123948},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034129"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034129"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034129"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a378a221f51a962d1a0ce8b7804ccd01.jpg","FileDateTime":1595813000,"FileSize":1801995,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2839\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2839,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:46:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:41:29","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:41:29","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3157,"ExifImageLength":4003,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1284","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"He is extremely anxious that I should go right on there with him.

I presume it is not often if ever found in the Piscataquis. It must be however I think in Pleasant River. Miller's River is great for it. It may be found perhaps in most brooks, at some places, at some time or times, most every season. I remember seeing it of old in \"One Brook\" east of the Old House at Milo. There was a time Last Fall when Miller's River, where I was at Grout's was so full of Anchor Ice, as to raise the Water flowing over it a foot or two. It was probably some phenomena connected with the subject of Anchor Ice which occasioned the remarkable Ice freshet on the Penobscot three years or four since.

Your letter troubled me very much, and I have been thinking of it ever since. To be sure the subjects you advert to are very proper for any one at anyone, or at any time. It is every one's duty to attend to their will & everything therewith connected. I shall attend to mine as soon as I have any property etc. I have been thinking for a year or two of certain final requests etc. I wished to be understood, in case of accident, or evil. But what do you mean by an \"impression\" that you are not to be much more an \"actor in the world\"? Have you any right to such an impression? You say you may have more reason that I suppose. If there is any ground, pray explain it.\nYou have a constitution better than most even of those who live to Old Age; You have probably really injured it less than most of your age. by fewer irregularities & injurious habits. You are now suffering under an attack occasioned by some injury, which however I cannot see to injure your prospect of a long & eminently useful existence here. Your bodily health, I see no reason to think will not be as good as it ever was within a few months. As for Mental Health which you mention probably few ever enjoyed a greater share than do you. This is both hereditary, natural, educational, and cultivated. Yours is eminently a sound mixed race: the whole history of both roots of the family is conclusive. Metcalf's & Stevens's will uniformly be found both sound & strong, compared with those about them. In yourself centre these qualities in a rather unusual degree. Your mind is singularly well balanced. Among young men of my acquaintance there is no mind of equal practical wisdom. I do not say this in flattery, but in fact, the lessons of Wisdom which I am learning year by year from Experience, and I feel too learning faster than many around me are learning them. I recognize as your counsels, perhaps despised, long before. You should be the last one to permit yourself to be troubled by any thing like Hypochondria. I do not know as you are: but it struck me that perhaps the great change in your habits connected with leaving your usually engrossing business, and retiring to Milo, might to your active mind, make you low spirited. \nAt any rate do not give way to any such feelings. Make up your mind to be, as you were designed to be, and deserve to be, abundantly active & influential in the world. Very much indeed I want to come home to Milo this Spring and see you, but I have a great amount of business on my hands, and am like to have. Whether I may be able to get away for a week or two in the course of the Summer is quite uncertain. At any rate you have now no excuse in lack of leisure to write to me. If I cannot come  home, & you do not become engaged in business, I shall absolutely insist upon your coming on here and making me a visit. It would do you good, and really benefit me more than you can well imagine. I could afford to pay you pretty well for it. I should like my business compared with yours. Perhaps I might that it was best for you & Eliab to quit Mercantile life, and go to \"Rail roading\" in some form. It is a very extensive business, and shrewd men will prosper.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103223,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103223","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/908faf5ae3baaed75d488327126e3ed9.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/908faf5ae3baaed75d488327126e3ed9.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/908faf5ae3baaed75d488327126e3ed9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/908faf5ae3baaed75d488327126e3ed9.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:26:03+00:00","modified":"2020-10-08T03:21:07+00:00","filename":"908faf5ae3baaed75d488327126e3ed9.jpg","authentication":"96da3aa7d713faa0c8268e7bb97be67d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_194_004_005_o2.jpg","size":2069405,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3600,"resolution_y":3487,"compression_ratio":0.05495026500547},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034147"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034147"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034147"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"908faf5ae3baaed75d488327126e3ed9.jpg","FileDateTime":1595813000,"FileSize":2069405,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3600\" height=\"3487\"","Height":3487,"Width":3600,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:46:16","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:41:47","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:41:47","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":71,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3132,"ExifImageLength":3034,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1284","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"April 22d Joseph, if your disease is chronic, I am very much opposed to your use of violent remedies, no matter what the doctors say. Moderate, gentle exercise, warm bathing, gentle laxative diet; if you could only live upon our N.H. \"Rye & Indian\" Bread. If your bowels are not perfectly free, lax & easy, by all means attend to it, and carefully. A Pill as big as a small Pea, of Rhubarb taken every night will do you more good than all the medecines of all the Doctors. But above all things do not get to taking the Physic & medicines of the Doctors. As for my health, I am careful of it. I have learnt wisdom. I intend to husband it to the best possible advantage. I have much to do with it. Health has done much for me, & I intend to be careful of it. I have drawn largely upon a large stock. Probably not much more than one constitution in ten would stand unimpaired the Draft of my Collegiate Education. I believe mine did. Since then I have in Eighteen months dome the work and gained the station perhaps of four years of Engineering, and I believe have not injured my health. Perhaps I have weakened my Eyes.

Perhaps it is rather the result of the different tenderness of our occupations.  \n There seems to be in your letters a {to me, strange} tendency to Soar, to branch off on every occasion into Metaphysics, or some kindred matters. You cannot, from the very nature of your intellectual constitution, be a transcendentalist. No cultivation could induce it. But you have a tendency to think, talk, argue, about \"philosophy in the ancients' application of the term; Mind, thought, feeling, and the developments and phenomena thereof.  Now herein I cannot argue or sympathize with you.  I have a dim remembrance of a time when I took an interest in such matters. When I perceived something  in Upham Wayland, Cousin, Butler &c. in matters of their sort.  In fact, I suspect I might have had more inclination that way naturally than you.

You cannot have got my letter, I know. Do, Do come, Do. Come now. It need not cost but two 3 or 4 or 5 or three dollars to get here, and I will pay all Your Expenses as long as you will stay with me, all summer.\nYou must come. I have set my heart upon it. I shall be homesick right away, if you don't come. Perhaps \"throw up my commission\",  and come right home.\n\n  As to your present position, prospects, prospective employments & situation, we will wait & talk that all over after you get here -- in full.\n As for the History of Europe you enquire for, I am sure I can tell you nothing. If I could go into a good Library I could lay my hand upon the best thing extant in a very few moments, and perhaps tell something of its character; but all that matter is very much out of my line nowadays.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103232,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103232","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/21914fc323d5da1436c0148e15f44849.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/21914fc323d5da1436c0148e15f44849.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/21914fc323d5da1436c0148e15f44849.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/21914fc323d5da1436c0148e15f44849.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:26:16+00:00","modified":"2020-10-08T18:33:47+00:00","filename":"21914fc323d5da1436c0148e15f44849.jpg","authentication":"e90f0c0b5987c25374db0b6893c6885f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_194_006_002_o2.jpg","size":1747313,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2843,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.056907576764242},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034256"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034256"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034256"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"21914fc323d5da1436c0148e15f44849.jpg","FileDateTime":1595813000,"FileSize":1747313,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2843\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2843,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:46:37","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:42:56","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:42:56","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"SubSecTimeOriginal":8,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3130,"ExifImageLength":3963,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1284","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Lest possibly you do receive my other letter I must repeat again somewhat of my former very prolix directions to you, about reaching this place immediately.

July 8 etc. 1849\n\nDear Brother Joseph\n\n   Your letter of June 26th, 28th lies before me, but but I believe that a certain concatenation of circumstances alluded to in yours relieves me from the duty of replying to it until I again hear from you. However, happening to feel like it just now, I will indite a few lines, while I have leisure, against some letter day.\n  First the question you propose for correspondence; viz \"The Contained angle between a right course of conduct and a wrong one?\" This question is a remarkable illustration, both of your own ignorance of science, and also of the immense superiority of Mathematical over Metaphysical knowledge, as applied even to Ethical Science. Now the Question you propose might be in your way of looking at things a very difficult matter to solve, requiring I know not how many tough syllogisms & arguments of so many kinds. Applying Mathematics to it it becomes as plain as the nose on a man's face, the demonstration is as beautiful and simple as the propositions or theorems of Euclid....... But I will have consideration for you, & not introduce any more  mathematics.\nThose Questions you make are very good and  appropriate. Is that last one from Upham, I do not remember it really. the quotation about Dreams etc. I expect I am of a very prosaic nature even in my dreams. I have never had any such experiences as you & Charles & Prov. Phil. tell off. \n\nStill I certainly have rather a remarkable belief in all such things. I am credulous; if not imaginative.

I suspect you must have pretty much worn out all your sleeves in writing! I can imagine you grinning over it all to your self now.  Following out my directions with a vengeance, I should say!  I suppose you spent thought, positive mental effort, enough in conjuring up that dream, or whatever you call it, to last a common man a year.  Of course you can not expect me to puzzle my brains about it.  The only thing \"practical\" I find about it is the extremely salient adv ice never to go to bed without an intention of getting up again. Well, when I have leisure sometime, I will consider of it!\nIs it a fact that it still remains dry weather Down East? Here we are having decidedly a wet time. There was a great rain here about the time I came back; causing a real freshet & considerable damage. Bradford Pond was suddenly three feet above summer level &c.  Ever since then it has rained extremely easy here among the mountains. There have been two or three very rainy days, and showers very frequent, some of them very forceful.

Now suppose an eye with unlimited power of vision at any one of these places. It sees not on this Earth that now going on, but that going on just so long before as agrees with the distance. Now consider that unlimited vision with the unlimited power of Motion. Consider it as moving from a Star of the twelfth magnitude to our Sun in one hour. It sees in one hour every event of four thousand years from Abraham tending his flocks to the cannon balls on the last battle field of Europe. Or consider that Motion in one Second. Now Understand how a thousand years are with God as one day! Do you get hold of this? Just think of it! What an idea it commences with!

Dec. 20. 1849\n\nDear Brother\n\n          Your letter of 12, 19 inst was received just now; and now, while not having yet written from its perusal. will I commence a reply thereunto. I was extra glad to get your letter today; I had been much wanting it for some time. I always had a very sharp appetite for your letters; and now that you are away from home and folks, and not well, besides, I grow terrible fretted & anxious if I do not hear from you frequently. So much so that I can hardly keep from starting right off to go and see you for myself. At any rate you may expect to see me there sometime. I want to go over that Atlantic & St. Lawrence Railway. Besides there is some prospect that I may be out of business here before a great while, if they do not soon succeed in raising money to push the Road forward, and then I may have nothing to do but poking about to see the folks for a spell.\n  Hardly any thing in your letter affects me so much as your lecture upon my indolence & lack of ambition. I know it! I know it! I have long known it! It troubled me dreadfully in College. I fear it can never be overcome, if indeed it does not grown upon me. It is partly on account of that that I chose my present employment. Physical exercise is a pleasure to me, and I am always industrious in it; but my mind is - I am ashamed to say it - lazy; it will work bravely - when compelled to - but without absolute necessity it is almost impossible to make it. The \"Spur\" somehow fails to affect it. I am afraid it is not \"the clear spirit.\"\n\n[top and left-hand side upside down]This letter may be not as much as yours, but I have not probably as much leisure and if you will write soon & often, I gladly will. write certainly when Dr. M's decision is communicated.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103278,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103278","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/fe8af695b3616eb7809249e47c3b23ab.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/fe8af695b3616eb7809249e47c3b23ab.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/fe8af695b3616eb7809249e47c3b23ab.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fe8af695b3616eb7809249e47c3b23ab.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:27:17+00:00","modified":"2020-10-10T18:44:37+00:00","filename":"fe8af695b3616eb7809249e47c3b23ab.jpg","authentication":"c5e657753594dfdd7c550a304a35ed9d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_194_018_002_o2.jpg","size":1671034,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2865,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05400536487622},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034901"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034901"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034901"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"fe8af695b3616eb7809249e47c3b23ab.jpg","FileDateTime":1595813003,"FileSize":1671034,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2865\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2865,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:48:43","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:49:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:49:01","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3119,"ExifImageLength":3919,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1284","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"In fact I have almost succeeded in convincing myself that is not possible for one person to do every thing, that it was not best to have too many irons in the fire, and that an Engineer had better be confident to give up the languages and confine himself to Mathematics, and the really immense amount & variety of subjects more or less intimately connected with his profession.  \n\n   By the way, what sort of an effect upon a person of such unfortunate disposition, do you suppose that \"Getting married\" would have?

If you mean that they will not produce much dollars & cents: very well; but are they not worth some thing as a sort of Boot Tree to the mind, helping to expand it to that greatness which you say is its own exceeding great reward?\nI have not since a great while received a letter from Anne and answered it. The same for Lucy & Samuel. Mother & especially Eliab I have not heard from for some time.\n\nAnne thinks she will not retain her present situation after the two years is out, next August I suppose.\n\nYou ask who were my friends & acquaintance in Turner. All the folks of three or four years since especially in the South and East part of the Town Talbots, Carey's, Bradfords Brays Whitmans etc. etc. etc. etc. North & west, I knew not so much. I am a little afraid of Samuel's Flour Speculation.\n As for your remaining at Waterford, if Dr. Munde comes there I advise you by all means to day, stay, if he does not, perhaps you had better get what advice you can have of him as to future treatment and go home, establish yourself at Milo or at Hampden & get well as steadily as you can, or go to Brattleboro.\n\nThe Dr. Munde I have heard of.

Write to me just when you want to go and I will be there and accompany you I can just exactly as well as not, and I am better acquainted with Rail Road Travelling, and can do you good.  I can land you at Dr. Wesselheft's by easy stages & convenient journeys. I am nearly out of business here, and shall soon leave, very like for a better place, if you go to Brattleboro, I will go & go round with you, if you do not, I shall go home a few days at least. I can leave here any day now. to accompany you.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103284","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4b4739b70dc03515febc7d5c3802681c.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4b4739b70dc03515febc7d5c3802681c.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4b4739b70dc03515febc7d5c3802681c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4b4739b70dc03515febc7d5c3802681c.jpg"},"added":"2020-07-27T01:27:24+00:00","modified":"2020-10-10T20:45:30+00:00","filename":"4b4739b70dc03515febc7d5c3802681c.jpg","authentication":"ae5fa6c0c59fe13517a89825a0be73ab","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_07_fl_195_001_004_o2.jpg","size":1561540,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2884,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050134201469153},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034959"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034959"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180802"],"TimeCreated":["034959"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf "],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4b4739b70dc03515febc7d5c3802681c.jpg","FileDateTime":1595813003,"FileSize":1561540,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2884\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2884,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/11.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:08:03 09:49:02","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.125,"FNumber":11,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:08:02 03:49:59","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:08:02 03:49:59","ShutterSpeedValue":3,"ApertureValue":6.918863,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3142,"ExifImageLength":3921,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1284,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1284","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I was last week around on the Vermont & Mass R.R. at Grouts and Northfield, next round on business, but stopped over Sunday to see the folks etc. I have an invite to go back there to Montague or rather to Greenfield, upon that Branch R. where I was last Winter which they have just raised money to complete, but I do not think I shall go, there is but a little bit of it, and I am justified in looking for a better situation than I could have there.

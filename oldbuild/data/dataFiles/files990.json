I am thus far on my way home, and have been a little delayed by inclement weather, and tho' recovered it will be utterly impossible for me to think of returning to Washington for the winter","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":63862,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/63862","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/6c1157ab38d4be0b5683b6f62a2a78e5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/6c1157ab38d4be0b5683b6f62a2a78e5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/6c1157ab38d4be0b5683b6f62a2a78e5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6c1157ab38d4be0b5683b6f62a2a78e5.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T14:04:10+00:00","modified":"2020-03-31T16:53:37+00:00","filename":"6c1157ab38d4be0b5683b6f62a2a78e5.jpg","authentication":"cb52e61727370fd5c7f2306fadb02f20","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_606_BX02_FL046_00008_o2.jpg","size":1697561,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2895,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.054294153393463},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120518"],"TimeCreated":["090236+0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120518"],"TimeCreated":["090236+0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20120518"],"TimeCreated":["090236+0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6c1157ab38d4be0b5683b6f62a2a78e5.jpg","FileDateTime":1521813807,"FileSize":1697561,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2895\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2895,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:06:05 14:28:24","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":182},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:18 09:02:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:18 09:02:36","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":96,"SubSecTimeOriginal":96,"SubSecTimeDigitized":96,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2455,"ExifImageLength":3052,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":990,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/990","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Session of Congress, should the Legislature be disposed to elect me.

Troupe? is here and in good health together with his  newly married wife. Smith and Cobb are also on the ground and as yet in good health. We are in a state of perplexity and confusion in this place. There are almost as many plans as members, and the plan of every man like the hand of the son of Hagar","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":63893,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/63893","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/cfb7e81a7dc7a79bfbcd59a7f38bb993.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/cfb7e81a7dc7a79bfbcd59a7f38bb993.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/cfb7e81a7dc7a79bfbcd59a7f38bb993.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cfb7e81a7dc7a79bfbcd59a7f38bb993.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T14:04:49+00:00","modified":"2020-04-01T15:30:26+00:00","filename":"cfb7e81a7dc7a79bfbcd59a7f38bb993.jpg","authentication":"756325a914868d2f58e1edb7e31d5520","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_606_BX02_FL054_00002_o2.jpg","size":1810255,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2938,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057051124473691},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120518"],"TimeCreated":["093026+0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20120518"],"TimeCreated":["093026+0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20120518"],"TimeCreated":["093026+0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cfb7e81a7dc7a79bfbcd59a7f38bb993.jpg","FileDateTime":1521813808,"FileSize":1810255,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2938\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2938,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:06:05 15:31:01","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":182},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:18 09:30:26","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:18 09:30:26","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":67,"SubSecTimeOriginal":67,"SubSecTimeDigitized":67,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2454,"ExifImageLength":3006,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":990,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/990","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"is against the plan of every other man.

The unsettled state of the Spanish monarchy-- the distant, dispersed and feeble state of some of the colonies of that empire, especially of the Floridas, and their relations to the U.S. have excited considerable concern in the gov't of this country as to their final destiny. The extent, and nature of the soil of these provinces, forbid the idea of their being an independent nation.

We have done nothing in our legislative capacity from which the views or intentions of this body upon the course we are to pursue towards Great Britain can be ascertained. Our committee of foreign relations have not agreed to any one of the various propositions which have been submitted for its consideration. A proposition declaring that unless the orders in council were repealed by the first day of April next that war should be made upon Great Britain was this morning decided in the committee, only members voting for it. The proposition was to have been discussed with closed doors, and if adopted would have been followed up by raising an army of 20.000 men, and by the equipment of the public vessels of war. The original proposition was not to have been promulgated officially until the day when it was to be raised. The committee having negatived this proposition, adjourned until Monday morning.

The money which the two former purchases would have produced would have established as many of these Seminaries as the wants of the State would have required and would have rendered having able every stream in the State affording water sufficient for this purpose, and have cut all the canals which public convenience would have required.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":63981,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/63981","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/9d155797851d8b81311242244c906ff3.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/9d155797851d8b81311242244c906ff3.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/9d155797851d8b81311242244c906ff3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9d155797851d8b81311242244c906ff3.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T14:06:31+00:00","modified":"2020-04-04T14:53:14+00:00","filename":"9d155797851d8b81311242244c906ff3.jpg","authentication":"b7d4258f8c854c431814914bc1de1c1c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_606_BX02_FL072_00004_o2.jpg","size":1981143,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2868,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.063960657833566},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["e\/"],"DateCreated":["20120518"],"TimeCreated":["114132+0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["e\/"],"DateCreated":["20120518"],"TimeCreated":["114132+0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["e\/"],"DateCreated":["20120518"],"TimeCreated":["114132+0000"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"9d155797851d8b81311242244c906ff3.jpg","FileDateTime":1521813812,"FileSize":1981143,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2868\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2868,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5.1 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:06:06 10:27:00","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":182},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:18 11:41:32","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:18 11:41:32","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":6,"SubSecTimeOriginal":6,"SubSecTimeDigitized":6,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2403,"ExifImageLength":3016,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":990,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/990","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"This would have given an additional value to all the land in the State greater than the whole value of the land bestowed in the lotteries. Thus every man in the State who had 200 acres of land would have been more benefitted by the sale of the public land and the proper disposition of its proceeds, than if he had drawn a tract of the ordinary value. The lands which lie within 10 miles of the Turnpike from Lancaster to Philadelphia brings $100 an acre without regard to its quality. The lands within twenty miles of a river rendered navigable, or a canal, or even of a turnpike road, levying toll would double, treble and in many cases would increase its value ten fold-- And it can be proved that the sale of our public lands already given, as well as that yet to be disposed of would bring every mans land in that distance of a navigable river, canal or turnpike road levying no toll-- and in addition as they establish a free school forever in each Capts company.

Some famous men of the tribe were also shown to me who, as proved by the corresponding scars and mutilations, had gone through these horrid ordeals six or seven times. It seemed that no care was taken of the wounds thus made, and that neither bleeding nor inflammation to any extent ensued, which was owing, probably, to the checked circulation and reduced condition consequent upon their four days' fasting and abstinence. During the whole time of this cruel part of the ceremony, the chiefs and dignitaries of the tribe were carefully making their observations, to enable them to decide who amongst the different candidates should prove the hardiest and most stout-hearted; who could hang the longest without fainting, or who was the soonest up after he had fainted, that they might judge whom to appoint to lead a war party, or to whom the most important posts should be assigned,\nAs soon as six or eight has passed through","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":67004,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/67004","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b987e9f3c77c5876ed2592f2abd0928e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b987e9f3c77c5876ed2592f2abd0928e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b987e9f3c77c5876ed2592f2abd0928e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b987e9f3c77c5876ed2592f2abd0928e.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-26T15:39:38+00:00","modified":"2020-03-26T16:54:20+00:00","filename":"b987e9f3c77c5876ed2592f2abd0928e.jpg","authentication":"9fe9c37afb308dfb0eb981ff59f889dd","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_150_00037_o2.jpg","size":1367144,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2720,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046539488017429},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120503"],"TimeCreated":["123019+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120503"],"By-line":["2"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120503"],"TimeCreated":["123019+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120503"],"By-line":["2"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120503"],"TimeCreated":["123019+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120503"],"By-line":["2"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b987e9f3c77c5876ed2592f2abd0928e.jpg","FileDateTime":1522078743,"FileSize":1367144,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2720\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2720,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:05:14 08:06:29","Artist":"\u0003","Exif_IFD_Pointer":164},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:03 12:30:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:03 12:30:19","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":40,"SubSecTimeDigitized":40,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1817,"ExifImageLength":2404,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":2,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3321604070,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1012,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1012","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"29. the ordeal, they were led out of the lodge with the weights still hanging to their flesh, and dragging on the ground, where still more painful suffering awaited them.

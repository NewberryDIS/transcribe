There was an awful fire in Portland last night - burning over about one hundred acres - including the business part of the city - All the city buildings - the Post Office  the Printing offices, three Congregational Churches - including Dr Carruthers, Insurance offices all but two, turning out of house &  home at least five hundred  families - Large sugar refining was burnt - A Mr Chandler called this morning who had just come from Portland - His home was burned and every thing in it - only what he could draw away on a wheelbarrow. The sky was very red in that direction last night -, and the glare sometimes lighted our rooms - but we knew nothing definite till this morning - A good many Yarmouth people went to Portland staying over to see the evening fireworks - They got fire worked beyond their expectation - I do not know but I am a sufferer, for I think there might be a letter","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":98793,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/98793","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/39c9bbaf5fda8633e8a11114271e9b1c.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/39c9bbaf5fda8633e8a11114271e9b1c.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/39c9bbaf5fda8633e8a11114271e9b1c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/39c9bbaf5fda8633e8a11114271e9b1c.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T19:17:48+00:00","modified":"2020-07-12T00:25:24+00:00","filename":"39c9bbaf5fda8633e8a11114271e9b1c.jpg","authentication":"e5c40728df22f43de67c784848d3ec33","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_113_017_004_o2.jpg","size":1092531,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2282,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044329657220762},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180720"],"TimeCreated":["025755"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180720"],"TimeCreated":["025755"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180720"],"TimeCreated":["025755"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"39c9bbaf5fda8633e8a11114271e9b1c.jpg","FileDateTime":1587323737,"FileSize":1092531,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2282\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2282,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:23 09:51:19","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:20 02:57:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:20 02:57:55","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2349,"ExifImageLength":3705,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1242,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1242","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"there from you -

The walls of the elegant city buildings are mostly standing, but entirely cleaned out within, and cracked from top to bottom in varis places. The Post Office of stone is in such a condition that they do business in it, and have all the while. Everything all around it is gone. It was said to be a fine sight to see the flames roll up against it, time and again without seeming to have power to harm it. The glass throughout the building is all gone.

The sunshine, the singing of birds, and the delicious air, with the views that never can anywhere be surpassed, it seems to me, make it glorious. Here, at Dea Parker's, the view is very extensive. Kearsarge, Monadnock and the White Mountains can be seen, as well as the ranges of smaller hills. I mailed a letter to you at Concord Tuesday morning on the way here. But I have not heard from you since last Friday, almost a week. I think there must be a letter for me at the office but- we have not heard from there, since I came. It has been rather hard to be patient. Dea Parker says he will go this P.M. to the office & I shall go to, and make calls and perhaps spend the night somewhere.

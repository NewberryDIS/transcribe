When I came home last night I found a good letter in my box at the PO \nawaiting me from sister Lydia.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":39329,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/39329","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3119c497fd8336641635ca019dadb800.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3119c497fd8336641635ca019dadb800.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3119c497fd8336641635ca019dadb800.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3119c497fd8336641635ca019dadb800.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-26T17:05:06+00:00","modified":"2020-05-08T03:40:48+00:00","filename":"3119c497fd8336641635ca019dadb800.jpg","authentication":"30fb807104cc6b51bdde98c36f65df0c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_01_fl_08_002_02_o2.jpg","size":1514064,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2943,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04763544380262},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170710"],"TimeCreated":["023816"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170710"],"TimeCreated":["023816"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170710"],"TimeCreated":["023816"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3119c497fd8336641635ca019dadb800.jpg","FileDateTime":1509037400,"FileSize":1514064,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2943\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2943,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:10 15:29:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:10 02:38:16","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:10 02:38:16","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3496,"ExifImageLength":4276,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":168,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/168","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"She is very well and seems quite happy she says she finds excellent society \nin Quincey.

Have you wish sometimes as the still hours of Twilight found traced upon your soul the handwriting of your absent friend? The hour where \"day joins the past eternity\" is the time that I visit the loved & absent. This is a beautiful sabbath morning. The church bells are ringing forth, their peals telling us that it is the hour for worship. Is there not my friend something peculiarly touching in the thought that all over christendom these same sounds are vibrating, inviting God's children our brethren to think of & commune with the invisible world? How strongly & strangely our thoughts & hearts are tinged with the hue of those minds with whom we associated.

I have not felt her loss so much at any one time before since her death. I know not why unless it was because I had just returned from Peru & her grave. One week ago to-day, one of my brothers spent with me so that I could not write. The past week I have been to Peru, Indianapolis & Lafayette, & now I am writing to you. It is there I might have found time to write letters during the past two months, but I have spent my leisure time in reading & thinking.

I left La Porte about 1\/2 past 12 last night & reached here about 1\/2 past 9 tonight, having had the best of success in making connections. I came by the way of Toledo & Mansfield which, made my journey some 500 miles. I am feeling quite well although I went without sleep last night. I like this house very much. The servants are very attentive, the rooms are good, & one can get there the solid comforts of life. I frequently am in public Houses much more gorgeous in appearance, but I seldom find a Hotel about which there is such a home like atmosphere. This city is unlike any other city I ever was in.

When I was here last I procured a saddle horse and rode up the steep bank of the river, and got off my horse & went in for a short distance to one of the coal mines. From the city I could see that the sun was shining upon the cliffs, & I thought perhaps from their tops I might get a view of the city, but, the cloud of smoke that rested upon the city was so dense that I could see but very little of it. When I see you I will try to describe the appearance of this strange city & of the mines. I am a little tired to-night but I thought before retiring I would write you a few words just to let you know that I have had a safe journey. I wrote you a few lines last night at La Porte which you will probably get with this. I am very anxious to hear from you to know your feelings relative to my proposed plan which I wrote you about a short time ago, & which will result if it meets with your views in bringing about our Marriage Feb 10th.

There is quite a difference between the customs & manners of the people here & in New England, also in the appearance of the towns. Many Eastern people get the idea that every thing western must necessarily be wrong & anything that is done differently from what they are accustomed to, is perfectly ridiculous. They look at things through the colored lens of prejudice & of course see nothing as it really exists. I often hear people say \"they don't do so East\" & repeat it so often that it is not only annoying but positively disgusting. The phrase \"they don't so so East\" has become a bye word here. I met a lady in the cars a few days since who was putting on airs, & having over the above phrase frequently. She run down everything.  The Society, the people, & the country came in for a share of her slang. Doubtless she found things different from what they are East, but at the same time as the west was now her home how foolish it was in her to try & quarrel with it, & to make Such remarks as to make the people with whom She associates her enemies.

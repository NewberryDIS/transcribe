Three long weeks have passed since I have heard one word from any of my brothers or sisters. This is the fourth letter I have written since news from home has blessed my lonely heart. I write regularly every tuesday evening and I should not wonder if you could guess almost every time when to expect a letter from me. When we formed our society for letter writing I thought it was so arranged that we should each one get one letter every week, if it is not so, tell me in your next, so that I shall not again expect to hear when no letter is due to me. I never felt as though I had so few friends as I now feel that I have. I feel all the time as though I were in the midst of strangers. There are so many here that it is impossible to get acquainted. Every meal the tables are set for 210 persons. It seems like quite a village all in one family. Next week is thanksgiving and many of the young ladies are going home, we shall have a vacation of four days for the accomodation of such. I cannot spend it with you but if you write me some letters, I will place the likenesses that I brought with me around me and (although so many faces will be wanting) try to imagine myself really surrounded by those I love. I expect we shall have quite a pleasant day at the seminary. I have written no where but home since I have been here I hope next week to find  time to write to others. Tell Mary Thomas that then she shall hear from me.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":24414,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/24414","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/6349aa048b828857b605890ac6cf8290.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/6349aa048b828857b605890ac6cf8290.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/6349aa048b828857b605890ac6cf8290.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6349aa048b828857b605890ac6cf8290.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-05T14:14:04+00:00","modified":"2021-01-18T15:13:10+00:00","filename":"6349aa048b828857b605890ac6cf8290.jpg","authentication":"45dc48d3a0ba04c5d9aa7e95d177efac","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_04_fl_152_001_02_o2.jpg","size":1489673,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2873,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048009984401387},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["004731"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["004731"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["004731"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["004731"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["004731"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["004731"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6349aa048b828857b605890ac6cf8290.jpg","FileDateTime":1507212831,"FileSize":1489673,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2873\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2873,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:08 09:53:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 00:47:31","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 00:47:31","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":97,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/97","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Last week a young lady drownd herself in the mill-dam of this place.

Her head pains her all the time and writing makes it worse, so when I am pretty faithful she is content, but when I neglect, she feels in duty bound to do the best by way of writing herself. Last week she wrote to Libbie and to cousin Mary and it almost made her sick. She does not feel quite so well as usual this week as she has a hard cold since Monday. I too am suffering from cold with quite a cough, and baby is sick and last night the other boys began to complain of colds. We think it is an epidemic cold. The weather was very bad for colds last week--it has been warmer and very pleasant this week\n\nin top margin\nto 433 for the present. We have not replied yet. Did Wm Thomas mention Robert James' death in his letter to you. Mr. J. was sick only three days I believe. The church in Penymynydd will miss him sadly. Mr. Brooks has returned to the M.E. church here and they have a new minister in Remsen. I almost forgot to say anything in reply to your offer to take some of your money. It may be necessary after a little--but we will write again.

On the last two pages you will find the amount that is owing in each place, with the number of the delinquents in each place. I have also taken from the mail book of 1876 some names of places in Wis. where the Cen. was taken so that time and the number of subscribers.  This may help you some in deciding what places to visit and what route to take.  The subs. in Illinois were more more scattered, only one or two in one place generally.

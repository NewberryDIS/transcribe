This is a large Welsh settlement and it is impossible to do much work except after 5 P.M. as most of the men are in the works and do not come home to dinner.  Of those on my list of debtors for cen. there are three who have moved away, three have died.  But I have collected $24 out of the list and $12 more will be paid within three months.  I have sold 25 copies.

Dear Sisters & All. I am now on my way from Venadocia to Radnor, 7 mi north of Deleware. I have to wait here two hours to make connections. Venadocia is a right smart place to raise corn, wheat pork &c, and there a great many good people there, but from my observation I should say it is a better field for selling \"Cofiant Dr. Rowlands\" \"Rhodd Main\" &c than those for my business. I was aware of this before going out but found it more so than I expected. I would not have been so anxious to go there but I wanted to see Wm. Williams Delphon formerly who owed $16.

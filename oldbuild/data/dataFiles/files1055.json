Beef at the season of their arrival was found to be very poor and was considered as very unwholesome.  The Cherokees therefore demanded pork or bacon.  The contractors refused to comply with their demand, saying their contract did not force them to supply any rations but those of beef; - they offered, however to commute the ration by paying for it one dollar a month in money. - The question of subsistence had been fully discussed with Gen: Scott, and referred to the war department previous to removal; and it was then decided that the Cherokees should at least for a  time, be subsisted with provisions in kind, until they could amply provide for themselves and satisfactory arrangements would be made with them through Capt: Collins. - From the exorbitant prices of provisions in the West, the offered commutation for money would be wholly inadequate; they must starve upon it.  If beef only was to have been furnished, why would any condition have been inserted concerning pork?  And was it right for the contractors to refuse a substitution of good & wholesome provisions in place of bad and unwholesome ones, merely because none but the bad & unwholesome ones are to be got at such prices as suit them? - Mr Richard Taylor, a conducter of the late emigration, is introduced to Gen: Arbuckle as the bearer of this letter Gen: Arbuckle is assured that unless a change is made in the quantity and quality of the rations, and in the","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70861,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70861","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/aaba40c2fe74a20252b34d2c148fba09.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/aaba40c2fe74a20252b34d2c148fba09.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/aaba40c2fe74a20252b34d2c148fba09.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/aaba40c2fe74a20252b34d2c148fba09.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:49:30+00:00","modified":"2020-03-22T22:49:01+00:00","filename":"aaba40c2fe74a20252b34d2c148fba09.jpg","authentication":"f3e8a8655ed71323c15f7282428573e3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL06_00008_o2.jpg","size":659860,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2379,"compression_ratio":0.051364563386421},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["025013+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["025013+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["025013+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"aaba40c2fe74a20252b34d2c148fba09.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424961,"FileSize":659860,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2379\"","Height":2379,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2379,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:12:44","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4939},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 02:50:13","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 02:50:13","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":10,"SubSecTimeOriginal":10,"SubSecTimeDigitized":10,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2379,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1055,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1055","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1839.\nAp: 23. -  in the mode of distributing them, the people will perish from sickness and starvation, -\nAp: 25. - Lieut: M.

McCall reports to Gen: Arbuckle the result of his expedition: - In obedience to the General's  orders of Ap:29: Capt. McCall had gone to Camp Illinois to seek all possible information concerning the reports of Indian hostilities that quarter.  He called at the residence of John Ross & delivered his credentials.  He found many of the principal men lately arrived in that country, with Mr Ross.  Mr. Ross said that the object of Capt McCall's mission had just been talked over among them; that they were most desirous of a thorough investigation; but that, as the persons then with him had assembled for the purpose of settling the accounts of the conducters of detachments of the late emigrants, paying claims, &  it would greatly inconvenience many Cherokees should the meeting be adjourned and this important business postponed, which must be the case if Mr Ross should leave home at that moment.  He regretted the impediment but immediately appointed Judge Adair and Mr. Stephen Foreman for that service.  Capt. McCall praises them as men of intelligence, and active in sifting the matter thoroughly and ascertaining every fact.  At Camp Illinois they desired Lieut: Hammond to send for the person who had informed him of the intended hostilities.  John Mosely, a Cherokee residing near the Camp was produced before the commissioners in presence of the officer.  He said he had given his information to prevent hostilities.  He wished his name not to be mentioned excepting to Gen: Arbuckle & John Ross, until after a thorough investigation; because John Nicholson, on of the Cherokees implicated, would shoot him if told that he had informed.  He said this John Nicholson three or four weeks previously passed the night at his house.  He then spoke much of the situation of the Cherokees.  He declared himself in favor of suppressing the sale of whiskey.  About two weeks afterwards Mr folsom again came to Mosley's unit John Smith & David Webber; the first a stranger to Mosely, the last he had seen four years' previously; - they were for the Cherokees.  All three said the people were oppressed, had lost their liberty & could not stand it any longer: now there was a country to which they could retreat it became the duty of every brave man & patriot to arm against the whites: that the troops at Camp Illinois were the same who had shot some of the Cherokee people in the Carolina Mountains, - & that by overpowering them, supplies of arms & ammunition could be got to begin the war.

Capt McCall remarks that on his journey he observed the Cherokee very generally engaged in building houses, clearing & fencing land and planting.  He learned that two associations had been entered into by individual Cherokees to suppress the sale of Whiskey.  As one held at Buckeyhead's at which Thomas Foreman, brother of Stephen Foreman presided, the resolutions were adopted by about 100 signers.  At another, as Judge Adair's, where Mr Sunter presided & the Judge was Secretary, there were 62 Signers.  In both cases it was recorded that all whiskey introduced by native's should be destroyed and the offenders punished; and all introduced by any white man should be taken away & the fact reported to the commander of the nearest military post.  To carry these resolutions into effect, a company of light horse had been organized, consisting of a Captain, Lieutenant & twenty men.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70864,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70864","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ad6d67d3a3d7c4f1ef50c16d2c10477e.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ad6d67d3a3d7c4f1ef50c16d2c10477e.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ad6d67d3a3d7c4f1ef50c16d2c10477e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ad6d67d3a3d7c4f1ef50c16d2c10477e.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:49:33+00:00","modified":"2020-04-25T14:25:33+00:00","filename":"ad6d67d3a3d7c4f1ef50c16d2c10477e.jpg","authentication":"2636a19580bf1873a16ee8f566bf25ae","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL06_00010_o2 copy.jpg","size":564583,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2379,"compression_ratio":0.04394804851089},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["025059+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["025059+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["025059+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"ad6d67d3a3d7c4f1ef50c16d2c10477e.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424961,"FileSize":564583,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2379\"","Height":2379,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2379,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:12:45","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4086},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 02:50:59","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 02:50:59","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":26,"SubSecTimeOriginal":26,"SubSecTimeDigitized":26,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2379,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1055,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1055","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1839.\nMay 4. - W.S.

Moseley does not wish his name known in the affair.  By all accounts he is a man of bad character. - The commissioners are happy to state that during their journey they discovered no marks of anything but peace & quietness.\nMay 4. - John Ross, Principal Chief, writes from Park Hill to Gen: Arbuckle.

But he remarks that since the report of the 26th of April, from Lt Hammond, the ground of alarm has been changed.

The Principal Chief complains that while names are privately handed about as projectors of hostility, and reputations injured, the accusers are screened by injunctions of secrecy; and thus both the Cherokees & the United States service exposed to serious injury from the covert practices of the wicked & designing.   ?Hence?","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70865,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70865","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f950b005100ae9c7d9897c305749b957.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f950b005100ae9c7d9897c305749b957.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f950b005100ae9c7d9897c305749b957.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f950b005100ae9c7d9897c305749b957.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:49:33+00:00","modified":"2020-04-25T14:35:52+00:00","filename":"f950b005100ae9c7d9897c305749b957.jpg","authentication":"41b53d18c9ca3046e1dba5a4250d990b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL06_00010_o2.jpg","size":632351,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2379,"compression_ratio":0.049223218594803},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["025059+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["025059+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["025059+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f950b005100ae9c7d9897c305749b957.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424961,"FileSize":632351,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2379\"","Height":2379,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2379,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:12:46","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4218},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 02:50:59","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 02:50:59","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":26,"SubSecTimeOriginal":26,"SubSecTimeDigitized":26,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2379,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1055,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1055","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1839. - \nMay 4. - Hence the Principal Chief seeks a full & impartial investigation.

This the western Council considers sufficient to justify a belief that the people are very well satisfied; and hence they ( the western Council) find fault with further agitation of the question of union, which they say only pro tracts debate, and unnecessarily, because the Union has already been fully & satisfactorily accomplicked. As respects the wishes of the eastern Council that their original laws from beyond the Mississippi should be brought here, brought to life & have full force in the present nation, the western national council behave that such an admission would be entirely repugnant to the government & laws of the cherokee nation, and create great dissatisfaction among the people. They add that the admission of two distinct codes of law & two distinct governments in the same country and over the same people, has never been known in any country, & even asked by any people.-To this note, a second is appended by the western chiefs, who desire the eastern Chiefs to regard this as their answer to the proposition made by them. \nJune 15.

The meeting of the chiefs proposed by Gen: Arbuckle to prevent further acts of violence meets the entire approbation of Mr Ross, & unless prevented by time providential occurrence, he will with pleasure be present, hoping that some  satisfactory arrangements may be made to secure the peace & tranquillity of the people.\nJune 24.\nJohn Ross, P.C. writes to Gen: Arbuckle from Park Hill.  Since the communication madeby Mr Ross yesterday, by Lieut\u00a0:Porter, an additional number of his friends had assembled to prevent or repel an attack uponhim, as was reasonably anticipated from the violent threats of personal revenge.  He has explained fully to them the despatch of Gen: Arbuckle, proposing a meeting at FortGibson; and also the nature of his reply. After a conversation among themselves, they have concluded that is not adviseable for him to proceed to Fort Gibson, without a sufficient escort of armed men to ensure safety: he is informed. also , that they have determined that, in consequence of the present position of things, he shall be so accompanied.  He has deemed it proper to state their fact to the General & at the same time to assure him that no improper feelings on the part of the Cherokee people towards the United States' Government or its offices, prompts the course they have determined upon:  he sincerely hopes, with this explanation, that no prejudicial motive will be attributed to such a movement; and he respectfully suggests in as much as he cannot attend at FortGibson unaccompanied in this manner by","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70879,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70879","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4370e7a42911b7c5d6a6b2fae4422a7c.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4370e7a42911b7c5d6a6b2fae4422a7c.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4370e7a42911b7c5d6a6b2fae4422a7c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4370e7a42911b7c5d6a6b2fae4422a7c.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:49:44+00:00","modified":"2020-04-05T17:36:00+00:00","filename":"4370e7a42911b7c5d6a6b2fae4422a7c.jpg","authentication":"20923602f9ffc1f5d02db635113770a5","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL06_00018_o2 copy.jpg","size":530295,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2379,"compression_ratio":0.041279015459343},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["025902+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["025902+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["025902+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4370e7a42911b7c5d6a6b2fae4422a7c.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424962,"FileSize":530295,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2379\"","Height":2379,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2379,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:12:53","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4025},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 02:59:02","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 02:59:02","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":65,"SubSecTimeOriginal":65,"SubSecTimeDigitized":65,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2379,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1055,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1055","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1839.\nJune 24. continued.\nby his friends, whether it would not be mere adviseable for Gen: Arbuckle to request the chiefs & those whom he had decired to attend, to proceed to the abode of         Mr Ross,  accompanied by the General, or such of his officers as he may designate, and let the proposed consultation be held there.

He transmits 7 documents in relation to the late outrages in the Cherokee nation .*   He had attended, by invitation from several of the Chiefs, a Cherokee Council which had assembled early in the month, for the purpose, as he understood, of entering in to such arrangements with the late emigrants as would satisfy all the Cherokees.  The United  States Agent was also present.  They soon perceived a difficulty between the old settlers and late emigrants, which was likely to present the expected re-union.  They exercised what influence they could to bring about a friendly understandings, but to no purpose.  The old settlers contended that their Government being effective, it was in their opinion a fair participation in the government, to permit the new emigrants to vote for officers when vacancies occurred.  The new emigrants wished a convention called to frame a new constitution for the whole nation's government.: to this the old settlers objecting, the council broke up without any arrangements.  Soon after, on the morning of the 22d, news reached Fort Gibson that John Ridge had been killed' the same afternoon it was reported that Mr Boudinot was killed; and on 23rd that Major Ridge , the father of John, was also killed. Subsequent information shows that all three were killed on the same day, the 22d;- and although John Ridge lived seventy five miles from that fort, news of his death reached there within a few hours of the time it was said to have taken place. The general refers to the communication of Mr Ross on the 24th , as showing that a general convention would be held soon,  within a few miles of his residence.  The General had conversed on the subject with some of the chiefs & principal men;- they told him the notification had not been general, as they themselves had not been informed of it; hence he infers that the convention  may be  composed \n\n 1.

The Superintendant says the Coun-cil, as stated, was called by all parties, to adopt such rules and regulations as might be deemed proper for the Cherokee nation. The Superintendant was invited to attend the Council & would have done so, but for public engagements elsewhere  He is informed, however, by Gent. Arbuckle & Governor Stokes, who were both present, that at this Council it soon became evident that the parties would not unite. He says  the Ross party  proposed to the old settlers, that they would select an equal num-ber from both parties, and adopt a con-stitution to  be submitted to the people, and that, if approved of, the same indi-viduals should proceed, in Convention, to pass laws under the constitution for the Cherokee nation.  The Superintendant  pro-nounces  this proposition a reasonable one, when the strength of the parties is considered.  But he says the proposition was unfortunately rejected by the old settlers, who gave it as a reason, that the laws as now in existence must stand  until the regular meeting in October; con-sequently the Council adjourned, after be-coming much excited against each other, and the Ridge party joined the old settlers; and Mr Ross called convention to meet  on the first of July on the Illinois and called upon the Cherokee to attend. - The Superinten-dant says he has already addressed the Com-missioner from Fort Gibson, in relation to the difficulty between the Cherokees. - He says, when he landed there, he immediate- ly addressed Mr Ross, requesting his Council either to be adjourned or postponed, that the old settlers might be induced to participate in it, knowing that unless the parties were united                   \n\n                                                                                                                                                                    turn over leaf","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70911,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70911","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7ec152442e3ccc4ee1900451f807059a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7ec152442e3ccc4ee1900451f807059a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7ec152442e3ccc4ee1900451f807059a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7ec152442e3ccc4ee1900451f807059a.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:50:10+00:00","modified":"2020-04-11T05:18:04+00:00","filename":"7ec152442e3ccc4ee1900451f807059a.jpg","authentication":"305227e76c2388c02f0c396694c31ee4","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL06_00034_o2 copy.jpg","size":533266,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2361,"compression_ratio":0.041826752631496},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["031007+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["031007+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["031007+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7ec152442e3ccc4ee1900451f807059a.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424963,"FileSize":533266,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2361\"","Height":2361,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2361,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:13:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4283},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 03:10:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 03:10:07","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":43,"SubSecTimeOriginal":43,"SubSecTimeDigitized":43,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2361,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1055,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1055","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Continued from over leaf -\n\n\n1839 \nJuly 12. continued.\nunited, there could be no adjustment of their difficulties. Mr Ross answered him declining the adjournment of the Coun-cil or convention, but requesting the Super-intendant to visit it, which he did; & found about two thousand Cherokee men upon the ground. He remained all night.  He saw nothing like disorder: every thing he saw indicated a friendly feeling: not a drunken Indian was in the Camp.  He met them in Council; explained to them the object of his visit and that the old (the western) chiefs, with what was called the Ridge party, were at Fort Gibson: that they had now determined to accede to the proposition made to them at the council, to appoint an equal number from each party & meet in convention and adopt such a constitution and laws as might be proper for the whole Cherokee nation; to which the Ross council answered that they were then assembled in convention em-bracing both parties, and were anxious that the old (the western) chiefs should unite with them.  The Superintendant states that there were perhaps a dozen old settlers at this council, neither of whom as either a chief or a leading  man.  The Superintendant has  the com-mmunication  of their Council to the old settlers at Fort Gibson, who de-clined the meeting, stating their unwil-lingess to meet the Council, having no authority to do so; but they fixed upon a Council to be held on the 22d instant by the old settlers, and such others as might choose to attend, at which the whole sub-ject would be laid before the people. The Superintendant will,if possible, attend this Council.  He is unable to say how this un-fortunate difficulty between the Cherokees may eventuate.: he states that both parties manifest the greatest feeling; that at one time not only he, but genl Arbuckle, and in-deed every one else, thought there must be an immediate repture: he hopes that diffi-culty between the Cherokees will be settled: he has informed them, as well as  the other tribes, that until harmony is restored, no money will be paid to them; that the state of the country  is too unsettled to permit it; that they therefore saw the deep interest they had in \"not clear\" good order.   \nRep: Doc: No2. 26rh Cong:\n1st Sess\u00a0:paper 363","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70912,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70912","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/01a6047d9a76e6cc92cbea868e9981e1.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/01a6047d9a76e6cc92cbea868e9981e1.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/01a6047d9a76e6cc92cbea868e9981e1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/01a6047d9a76e6cc92cbea868e9981e1.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:50:11+00:00","modified":"2020-04-11T05:50:45+00:00","filename":"01a6047d9a76e6cc92cbea868e9981e1.jpg","authentication":"61b38594252122dbf0471ea12652fb0c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL06_00034_o2.jpg","size":610555,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2361,"compression_ratio":0.047888920262914},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["031007+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["031007+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["031007+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"01a6047d9a76e6cc92cbea868e9981e1.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424963,"FileSize":610555,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2361\"","Height":2361,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2361,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:13:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3871},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 03:10:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 03:10:07","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":43,"SubSecTimeOriginal":43,"SubSecTimeDigitized":43,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2361,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1055,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1055","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1839\nJuly 13. continued.\nThey beg leave, in justice to them-selves, to remark, that the Gene-ral appears to have mistaken the true character of that concen-tion.

The writer, if nothing pre-vents, will be at FortGibson on the 20th of the month, on his way to their Council which is to be holden at the mouth of Illinois; by which time he hopes Gov: Stokes will be able to give him satisfactory & correct information on the important subject of his letter; the substance of which he has also sent to Gen: Arbuckle.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70917,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70917","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4c3e7ab3c57678327abc0b54a9e8c4a5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4c3e7ab3c57678327abc0b54a9e8c4a5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4c3e7ab3c57678327abc0b54a9e8c4a5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4c3e7ab3c57678327abc0b54a9e8c4a5.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:50:15+00:00","modified":"2020-04-11T12:01:11+00:00","filename":"4c3e7ab3c57678327abc0b54a9e8c4a5.jpg","authentication":"13e1d03f5eafa86e96ffe0debb48c249","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL06_00037_o2 copy.jpg","size":568534,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2379,"compression_ratio":0.044255600703688},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["031148+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["031148+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["031148+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4c3e7ab3c57678327abc0b54a9e8c4a5.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424963,"FileSize":568534,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2379\"","Height":2379,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2379,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:13:09","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4755},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 03:11:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 03:11:48","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":78,"SubSecTimeOriginal":78,"SubSecTimeDigitized":78,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2379,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1055,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1055","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1839.\nJuly 18. continued.\nthe welfare of the Cherokee  people, that this report is entirely destitute of truth; although it has been in a measure conformed by its having been reported that the force at the convention has been and is at that time daily increasing and that they intend to have in ser-vice at an early period, at least eight companies of mounted men.

They have no apprehension of civil war in the country; no set of men in \"cleristendom?\" would now deeply deplore such a  state of things; not can they see how it can hap-pen, when they, who are looked upon as one of the parties to en-gage in it, have no such idea' - The only war they are disposed for, is the war they are non trying in solemn convention to wage upon all objections among their brethren, either western ort eastern  to making \"not clear\" , or part of the one people, which they now are.  Commendable as every philan-thropist and patriot must deem this desire, their motion & wishes seem mistaken both by brothers of the west & white friends; both of whom sometimes talk of their \"friendish purposed.\" They consider the report received by the General the day before, of their design to prevent by an armed force the meeting of the old settlers at the mouth of the Illinois, as not only strange, but passing strange. They are almost inclined to believe that these are mere fabrications for political effect.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70921,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/70921","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/3fdf258de2869dfc464bc7a876d16545.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/3fdf258de2869dfc464bc7a876d16545.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/3fdf258de2869dfc464bc7a876d16545.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3fdf258de2869dfc464bc7a876d16545.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:50:18+00:00","modified":"2020-04-13T10:12:16+00:00","filename":"3fdf258de2869dfc464bc7a876d16545.jpg","authentication":"58f1ca356aac163f396c1e4c8886eb3e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL06_00039_o2 copy.jpg","size":515387,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2379,"compression_ratio":0.040118552768826},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["031217+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["031217+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["031217+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3fdf258de2869dfc464bc7a876d16545.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424963,"FileSize":515387,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2379\"","Height":2379,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2379,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:13:11","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3590},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 03:12:17","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 03:12:17","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":1,"SubSecTimeOriginal":1,"SubSecTimeDigitized":1,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2379,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1055,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1055","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1839.\nJuly 20.continued.\nand hope that in future he will treat them with the merited contempt of silence.

It appears to the General that their committees cannot effect these objects without a President at their head, to decide when the votes of the members may be equal.  The General thinks the next difficulty may be in relation to the individ-ual to preside.  the General judges he ought, if possible, to be some one who has not attached himself to either party, and is intelligent and honest, and not desirous of holding office; perhaps, continues the General, Judge Martin would, in that situation, give more general satisfaction than any other individual; yet, if a more intelligent and disinterested Cherokee can be found, he ought to be prefer-red.  The General judges that the proceedings of the convention ought to be submitted to the whole of the Cherokee people for their approval, before they are finally acted on. - The relation to the Chiefs in the new Government, the Gene-ral thinks it would perhaps give the most general satisfaction if one individual was nominated by the old settlers and one by the late em-igrants, - and , if a third should be required, that he should be nomina-ted by the Convention; these three to be voted for, and the one having the highest number of votes  to be first Chief; the one having the next highest, second chief; and the other to be re-garded as the third chief.

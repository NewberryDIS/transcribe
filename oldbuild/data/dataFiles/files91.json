I wonder if you too are not writing to me now. I can but hope so. I do hope I shall have a letter from you soon: you know you have not written to me since you were here. Tell the girls that I love them all, and would like to write to them if I could. Can not Father and Mother make me a visit before the term closes? It seems most too bad if they cant make us one good visit before E. moves away. She will have to leave her house the first of April and that will be, you know, in about five weeks now. I called at Mrs. Bowman's yesterday afternoon with Carry and Laura. We had quite a pleasant time. It was very slippery, and so the girls went clear home with me. If they had not I dont know how I should have got home for it was almost impossible to keep from falling down. This morning it was not quite as slippery but I had one good fall, however, but did not hurt me any. If Father has any money to spare, I should like to have him send me some before I go home as I have not enough to pay my tuition. I have about three dollars now and you know I owe Miss White five dollars besides seven for tuition. Give my love to Margaret and her little boys and all the rest of the folks. I saw Mary Thomas when I was in Utica Saturday she was in Roberts Room for a few minutes.

The only excuse I can give for not writing to you before is, that you did not write to me, and and you know I told you before you went that I should expect a letter from you first. We have not heard from the girls now for three or four weeks, and that was through a letter Jane wrote to Lewis; we (that is the folks at home) have not had but one letter from them since they went away. Sarah writes home about once a week; we had a letter from her a week ago last Monday, have not heard this week yet. Mother says that John Henry has really got a little sister; is it so? if it is, what is her name? who does she look like? and what does Johnny think of her? Out Church meeting is today, and I do wish you were here to go with us to the house of God, but as that cannot be we must be contented. Three have been received by letter since you went away. Griffith Jenkins and wife, and another woman. Father is away from home this week he started Monday morning, was going to somewhere in Madison County against Tuesday where they expected to have a meeting and were going to ordain Mr. John Lloyd a young preacher, and they were to have a meeting - in Waterville today, I think it was, we expect Pa home tomorrow night on Saturday. Edward Josiah went home last Saturday to see his folks and came back Monday. Mother and Aunt went to the village Saturday and Ma got me a shawl, and they got several other things.

Oct. 22\n\nMy Cynthia:\n\n  I have just been reading your very welcome letter, and you cant think how much good it did me. I feel so much better after reading it, it would be vain for me to try to tell you how much. I was trying to write a composition when Elizabeth brought it up stairs, but I guess that composition must go unfinised for tonight, and I will write a few words in this, instead. I was very glad to hear that Sarah dear was so much better. I had been quite anxious to hear, ever since I was at home, as, you know, she was quite poorly, then. Tell her I want her to get well fast against I come home again because I have got a good many things that I want to tell her, that I fear I shall not be able to, if she is not pretty strong.

If you all think best, I would like to have you speak to Mr. Jenkins and see how many scholars I should be likely to have: you","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":23192,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/23192","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7990f91f72023d4592a1d1d217d78ff2.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7990f91f72023d4592a1d1d217d78ff2.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7990f91f72023d4592a1d1d217d78ff2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7990f91f72023d4592a1d1d217d78ff2.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-04T20:16:44+00:00","modified":"2020-01-16T21:52:09+00:00","filename":"7990f91f72023d4592a1d1d217d78ff2.jpg","authentication":"1c2a8a3f1f7095983977bc4b0616c2d1","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_09_fl_342_004_02_o2.jpg","size":1004607,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2300,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040443115942029},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["224010+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["224010+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["224010+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7990f91f72023d4592a1d1d217d78ff2.jpg","FileDateTime":1507148155,"FileSize":1004607,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2300\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2300,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"8mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:22 10:54:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 22:40:10","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 22:40:10","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1292,"ExifImageLength":2022,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":91,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/91","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"might say that I would teach if I could get a class of about a dozen or so, and would charge about the same as they do in other schools.

Willie\n\nPlease give my love to Mrs. Griffith & Laura, and to Gwen, and remember me to all inquiring friends if any such there be.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":23212,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/23212","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/77e6cde916828b3f3bcb8a8cd8a04981.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/77e6cde916828b3f3bcb8a8cd8a04981.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/77e6cde916828b3f3bcb8a8cd8a04981.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/77e6cde916828b3f3bcb8a8cd8a04981.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-04T20:17:37+00:00","modified":"2020-01-16T21:52:10+00:00","filename":"77e6cde916828b3f3bcb8a8cd8a04981.jpg","authentication":"93e7bc387f64a54347543fb94c5de1d8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_09_fl_342_009_04_o2.jpg","size":1112522,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2238,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046028282527389},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["224127"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["224127"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["224127"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["224127"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["224127"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["224127"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"77e6cde916828b3f3bcb8a8cd8a04981.jpg","FileDateTime":1507148156,"FileSize":1112522,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2238\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2238,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:22 10:48:32","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 22:41:27","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 22:41:27","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":91,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/91","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"wished me to say to you that he does not go out for his health now quite as much as he did last spring.\nMrs. N. told me the other day to send her love to our people, when I wrote, and Callie says, \"and mine too.\"  Mary wishes to send her love to Cynthia, and says she would like to have you write to her.

Hope you will be able to write to us before long, for it seems so good to get letters from our home friends, and we want to know how you are getting along.  This has been a cold, wet day, but I like it better than the very warm days we have had since coming here.  They have a great deal of warm weather here, and but little snow in winter: but any quantities of mud.  It takes but a little rain to make it very muddy, and the mud here is so sticky, that it would be almost impossible to get about if it were not for the side-walks.

I am so sorry you have been having another time with your head.  I hope that it has passed off before this (the time, not the head I suppose) and that you are now quite well again.  I am afraid you all have quite too much to do, now we are gone (I mean Sarah).  We begin to feel that we really ought to be at home now, though we are enjoying ourselves here, and having good time generally.  We don't want to be selfish, you know, and we are waiting now for an answer to Sarah's last letter home.  Hope we shall have one this week.  I think we would both be quite contented to go home now, if it was thought best.  Mary do you really intend to go to New York by the first part of November?\n\nI wish you would tell Cynthia - or I will tell her.  Cynthia, when you wish to play all the parts of a piece - play all you can reach with your right hand - you can most always play three parts with your right-hand, if there should be a note or two of tenor that you can reach easier with the left-hand you had better play it so, but I think it best to play all the chords with right hand when you can and you will have your left-hand free to play a double bass if you choose.  I am glad you find time to practice some.  Hope you can more when we get home.  Couldn't you learn that piece that speaks of \"Abraham and Isaac and Jacob\"-   I don't recollect the name of it.  I think it is in the \"Golden Censer\".   It is easy, and pretty I think.  It is on the right-hand page somewhere. I guess you can find it.

Mr. and Mrs. Ricker and their little girl came over to spend the Sabbath and in the afternoon they very kindly offered us a ride in their carriage so Johnny, Sarah, the two Hattie's and I took possession.  We rode about three miles out and back - six miles in all - had a very nice time, and enjoyed it very much.\nWe send you a Specimen copy of Johnny's printing  You will see he has commenced a new edition of the bible, but after getting so far fell short of types so you see the work is standing.  He has made him a little press since he printed that, so he can now get a better impression.

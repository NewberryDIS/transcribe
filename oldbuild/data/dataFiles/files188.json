Yes, that happy band is broken.  Once has departed for realms of eternity.  Others are scattered here and there engaging in the busy walks of life; while others still, are yet remaining preparing themselves I trust for a career of future usefulness.   As it has been quite a long time since you heard directly from me, I will endeavor to give you a short account of what has been my situation since we separated at your mother's in Philipston.  A few days from that time I left home for the purpose of attending school at Wesminster.  I found the principal J. R. Gant to be a very fine man.  He was wholly devoted to his task and I think strove so to conduct his school that it would be of the greatest advantage to all those under his charge.  The thought almost startles me, when I recollect, that since then nearly nine months of my time has been spent attending school, and still that there is so much left I had desired to learn ere I left school as a scholar.

Soon after receiving the sorrowful intelligence of Mrs. Kendall's deceased I wrote to Mrs. Weaver and expressed our sympathy with you all in your deep affection.  It afforded us a melancholly pleasure to read the particulars of our dear friend's death, for how beautiful was her calmness at the hour of departing, and how consoling to your afflicted heart to hear from her own life assurance of continued watchfulness and affection in her Home beyond the skies.  Blessed thought for those who are this suddenly delivered of the society of dear friends, to know that while they feel sad and lonely, the Angel spirits of the departed are happy in Heaven.  It seems only natural that she should have felt this resigned for those who are as well prepared to live as she was are always prepared to die.  Hers was a Christian life in the highest acceptation of the term, corresponding in every particulars with a beautiful verse I committed to memory a short time since showing who might be considered true Christians.

Kendall\nDear Sir, \nI was pleased to receive your letter of 27th of August for your words in approbation of past conduct, and encouragement to future exertions I am much obliged.  You reminded me of the necessity of energetic labour and perseverance in overcoming obstacles to insure success in life- of this I have often been before reminded and I have ever endeavored to keep it in mind.  It is worthy of being repeated a thousand times, for the benefit of youth.  While I acknowledge this as true, I hope I do not fail to appreciate the value of a knowledge of this truth. I wish that every boy and girl could understand and feel the same.  Your kind advice to be careful of my health, I shall endeavor to follow. It is now much better than it has been.  You requested me to give you a history of Cleveland I am glad you spoke of it for I had not before thought to inform myself upon this subject- a matter which ought to be of considerable interest to me, since we have pretty much concluded to make of this place a permanent home.

We are just on the even of our Hale election. There has been an unusual stir about politics in this State - We Know Nothing party us making rapid strides.

I am glad to know you prise cold water as a remedy for disease - the more I hear of its use, the more firmly I am persuaded it is the only medicine that should be used. The Water Cure at Athol has had more patients this season then ever before. The successor of Doct.Hera? Mr. Field, has been very successful in the treatment of disease.

She was obliged to leave Bridgewater Normal school (where she was Precept? rep? in consequence of ill health - was very unwell and had been for a long time.

It is worth such to know how to keep well when water has set us right. We see the Water-Cure Journal Monthly. I think it is a periodical of great value. I often wish I had more time to read. I enjoy it as well as ever. We have plenty of reading always on hand. increasing my domain will not give me any more time to read than I have now. expect to have a hired man next year. I do not intend to neglect my spiritual interests in the multitude of my labors - let us hear from you often I will find time to answer your letters. Mrs. Holman will write on a separate page.

When I came we felt there was only a mere change for us to raise him from his feeble state.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43228,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43228","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f8636786db15e368e4a7ef645c91f7b5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f8636786db15e368e4a7ef645c91f7b5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f8636786db15e368e4a7ef645c91f7b5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f8636786db15e368e4a7ef645c91f7b5.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T16:38:29+00:00","modified":"2020-04-10T21:25:00+00:00","filename":"f8636786db15e368e4a7ef645c91f7b5.jpg","authentication":"99d72a1993f9ec42fb8fd63821108f92","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_098_005_004_o2.jpg","size":1617327,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3600,"resolution_y":2868,"compression_ratio":0.052214958158996},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["052949"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["052949"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["052949"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f8636786db15e368e4a7ef645c91f7b5.jpg","FileDateTime":1509467683,"FileSize":1617327,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3600\" height=\"2868\"","Height":2868,"Width":3600,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"23mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:09 14:01:08","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 05:29:49","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 05:29:49","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":77,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3777,"ExifImageLength":3010,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":188,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/188","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"But the \"Great Physician\" came to our aid, and by the blessed influences of His power attending us, our efforts ever successful, and he still lives. He is not quite well again but is comfortable and we trust will soon regain his health.  Grandmother \"withers\" but slowly for her weight continues at nearly two hundred.  She is, however, well and happy.  My mother dear still glides around this house with light elastic step, notwithstanding her labor and care have for a few years past been far greater than woman ought be called to bear. Her whole desire is for the good of her children, and for them she'll surely toil while yet her strength holds out. May they not forget the great debt due the parents who have so fondly and faithfully nourished them.  As regards [?], I've very much I'd like to say to thee, but as my sheet is nearly filled.  I must abridge and say all in as few words as possible.  It may excite they surprise, my friend, when I tell thee that my teaching days are over.  The experience of the past year has all to do with this conclusion.  When I left my school a year ago, it was my intention to enter very soon upon a course of study preparatory to entering Brown University in the fall. After being at home a short time, I found that father's health was very poor, and for several weeks he was not able to attend to his customary duties.  I could not feel justified in leaving him to labor alone in feeble health and concluded to remain at home for a time.  In September  I went to Providence and found that by close application and being very economical of my time.  I could before the year was out, stand even with others of the entering class, Ere I was fairly started in carrying out this plan I was sent for an account of father's sickness and it being necessary that I should remain at home several weeks, my [coll?] arrangements were entirely broken up not as much from a want of courage as from a feeling that such would be the wiser part and gave up the idea of a college course, since which time, my desire to make teaching my profession, has so much diminished that I have finally decided to have it out of account entirely and get into business as soon as possible.  I am thinking much of the western country. Were it not that my means are very limited, and that I am compelled to practice strict economy, I should travel through the west and try to decide for myself, upon a desirable location, the kind of business I should like to follow etc., etc. As I must deny myself this privilege and pleasure, I would ask thy worthy counsel and advice with regard to my turning my course westward.  Do you consider the west the place for a young man of limited means for all N.E.?  What [?] of the west do you think the most desirable as regards health and enterprise?  What course for obtaining a desirable situation do you recommend? About the kind of labor I am not particular except that it be lucrative and does not conflict with principles of honor and right.  I shall desire upon some course very soon therefore a few lines soon received [?] will meet the most grateful regard of thy friend, Hyman A.

But, that this spiritual birth is gradual, it does not expand at once, that it takes a long time to conquer all the evil passions which will rise (as a test of our strength) to have perfect Faith in God, to love our neighbor as oneself, & to do \nrighteousness. He told us, if we do not, adopt & practice the principles of truth & righteousness taught by Jesus Christ, we cannot enjoy the \"kingdom of God.\" I also went to hear Mr. Black, last evening a Cumberland\/Presbyterian minister, a talented man & one that I like very much. Although some parts of his sermon, were in opposition to my views, yet with most of it I was pleased. He first spoke of tenacity of our religious sentiments, of the importance of establishing in the mind some system of religion which would have as much truth in it - as comes within the range of the human mind, that we should search the Scriptures to indoctrinate the mind with the knowledge of the will of God, to form & fashion our character from Their teachings and that a correct knowledge of the Father is eternal life & happiness that we show to the world by our example, the purity of our religion. That This would be an argument that is irresistible. He said that there should more liberality in the church of Christ. There was too much of the spirit of bigotry & predjudice among Christians, too much unwillingness to \"try their Faith & see whether it be good\". He said a great many other good things, but as I am coming near the end of my sheet - I will close this.\n\n             Mr. Bacon thinks of leaving us next month. We are very sorry to part with him. He is one of those persons, whom we often hear spoken of as \"bearing acquaintance\". He has been here two years & the better we become acquainted with him, the more we feel attached. To the Sunday L. especially has he endeared himself * last Sabbath when he spoke of leaving us. You should have seen how sad the little girls looked, & several came to me after church \"Why, what makes Mr. Bacon go away? There is in our society as in every one I believe, those that exert a bad influence, & who have been working against Mr. Bacon for sometimes, and although he knows he has many friends, yet- he seems to think it  best for him to leave. These little disturbances always make me feel badly, but I do not know but they are everywhere. Have you read \"Records of Bubbleton Parish\". If you have, you will find some characters in it, which are very like some we have here. It is a work written by some minister \"East\" & will I think do a great deal of good.

I am now alone with our dear good boy who is sleeping so quietly that my thoughts can have full scope. I attended Church this morning Mrs. Holman this afternoon. It is with the utmost pleasure I devote these few, precious moments to you. We could not believe you had dropped us from the list of your friends. We continue to talk about you daily expecting every mail would bring us  a letter of your welfare and prospects when on a bright sunny morning about the 20th of August George brought us a letter from the other house overjoyous that it comes from Mr. Kendall, said Grandmother got it from the Office yesterday. No letter could have been more welcome the heart and spirit of Mr. Kendall was in it, though it came from Mrs. Josephine. We had heard by way of Sophia Brown of your wife's illness and that you were going to Indiana.

Miss Howe takes Harper Magazine, we take the Unitarian Quarterly Journal, Tribune, Water Cure Journal & Sunday School Gazette. besides an abundance of transient papers & magazines. I have read more books this winter than ever before in the same time. Since I have been confined to the house so much, have spent much of my time reading. If we have not improved mentally it has been our own fault. Spiritually, We ought to say as much. Our family worship morning and evening. We prise, and trust it has made us better. Our Sunday School worship has been broken. Mr. Putnam left Petersham 1st Oct. since then we have had various Minister: one a Mr. Jackson from Walpole N.H. has been in our family. We prise him much. - has supplied this pulpit now 10 or 12 Sabbaths, I think. An elderly man and one of large experience, was an Orthodox minister 30 years, is now thoroughly Unitarian, has a well stored mind and knows how to draw from it, to suit every occasion. I think we have profited bu his ministration in our family and from the pulpit. A Mr. DC Normandie from Town, preached for us two Sundays ago. The Parish gave him a call in Dec. he could not accept, as his people would not give him up. Since then a Mr. Bush has preached for us as a candidate, was liked very well but could not be our minister as the salary offered him ($700) was not adequate. Last Sunday & to-day we have had no preaching. Who we shall have to break to us the bread of life is not entirely solved? Ministers are scarce. Mr. Putnam asked a discussion 1st Apr to take place in six mos. The failed in pastoral duties was ever esteemed a good preacher. I have had your request and that of your sister, brought before the Church. It was voted to give you letters, and in the absence of a minister the Officers of the Church should make them out. You will probably get them with this letter.  --------\nPecunniarily, Our gains are slow, but we are making something more than our living.

There were but twenty four seconds between the lightening and the resultant thunder; the lightening was five miles distant. It became more blinding, the thunder more intense. The whole western sky was alight; it was a great mass of black rolling, churning squall clouds, which raced with unbelievable swiftness toward the encampment.\nThe breeze which had ceased for a spell, to gather breath and strength, now veered to the north west. At first it was gentle, cool, and refreshing, thenit was a puff and came in capful, boyantly and half joyfully, then angrily; it became a cold, wild, howling fury; it whistled throug the wagons and the trees; it moaned, and groaned, and roared withalmost hurricae force the wind was the vanguard. A prairie storm is a terrifying thing. The lightening was blinding, the thunder deafening; the willos beside the creek bent in long sweeping curves, leaves were torn from the trees, and branches of the cotton-woods snapped and fell. Torches which, but a few moments before, were seen moving about neighboring camps were extinguished. The rain struck; it came in horizontal sheets, all the broad world was shut out in the onrush; each raindrop was like the prick of a needle. THe mules turned tail to the storm; they stuck theit tail between their legs at half mast and their heads and their long ears drooped.\nThe sotrm of wind and rain increased.

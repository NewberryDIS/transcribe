I addressed myself to Dr. Bibb and to him alone, under the injunction of secrecy. I have this day rec'd his reply, from which I have extracted as much as is necessary to show you his opinion viz. \"That the unqualified acceptance of Gov. Mitchell of the Agency would be highly satisfactory to the people of Georgia, I am fully persuaded, but I think the objection suggested to the proposed unclear, insuperable. If the governor would consent to reside at the agency, he might make frequent excursions without subjecting himself to censure. In that way he might be absent probably half the year, but if his home is not understood to be there, or of a considerable portion of his time is not spent there I fear public clamor will soon drive him from the station. Every unfriendly act committed by any part of the Creek, would be charged to his absence, and inattention, and indeed every unpleasant occurrence among them would be attributed to the want of a resident agent, whose influence might have prevented it.

Upon the rec't of your letter on the subject of the military posts on the frontiers of Georgia, I had an interview with the President and the acting Secty of War. I communicated the contents of your letter to them. Instructions will be immediately given to plan a force upon the  Southern limits of the lands lately acquired sufficient to keep the hostile Creeks, Seminoles and Negroes in check. When the information was rec'd of the imputed invasion of New Orleans, i believed the thing wholly improbable, but coming from a respectable officer commanding at that post, it was deemed proper to order a concentration of the principal part of the regular force for the purpose of repelling aggression. I had however no idea that the Georgia frontier would have been left entirely defenceless.

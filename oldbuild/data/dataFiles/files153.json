Last week our place received no mails in consequence of the drifts, some of them being a mile long and six feet deep. But this week the Indians had helped to open a track some of the way and some of the way they went through Missouri and succeeded in getting the letters here though very few of the papers for Osawatomie were brought in, we did not get any thing though there are several due.\n We have had a very severe winter, and have had every facility afforded us for realizing it to the fullest extent I assure you. You know something about Steuben winds. \n Now suppose you were living in your wood shed, just as it was when we left there and was shaking ever day with \"the ague\" or shivering with \"the chills\" and your Steuben winds should take a notion to flow a keen blast all day with an atmosphere from 10\u00b0 to 15\u00b0 below zero. You could then know something of the misery that we have encountered for the last two months. Dec. 26th the thermometer showed 28\u00b0 below zero. Feb. 3rd the same, and Feb 4th found the Mercury 29\u00b0 (!) below zero - what would you have said to all that supposing you were still living in your wood shed!","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":35587,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/35587","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/56da976ce2d85711ca1429a60ab976f5.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/56da976ce2d85711ca1429a60ab976f5.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/56da976ce2d85711ca1429a60ab976f5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/56da976ce2d85711ca1429a60ab976f5.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T19:31:47+00:00","modified":"2020-08-15T15:54:15+00:00","filename":"56da976ce2d85711ca1429a60ab976f5.jpg","authentication":"3c1d35fe86893a76df19776cad9c1474","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_02_fl_111_001_02_o2.jpg","size":1236012,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2797,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040917252611925},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["040652"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["040652"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["040652"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"56da976ce2d85711ca1429a60ab976f5.jpg","FileDateTime":1507750278,"FileSize":1236012,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2797\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2797,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:03:03 15:23:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:02 04:06:52","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:02 04:06:52","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":48,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2321,"ExifImageLength":2987,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":153,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/153","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"We have written two or three times that we had received all the money sent but as you inquire I will repeat that we have had one $20 draft, one $23,75 draft, one $3 bill one eight cornered gold dollar, and in our last two round gold dollars beside one $3 bill from Jennie all of which were as thankfully received as they really were needed. \n I cannot write much more.

Sarah\nDear Father, - I have but few minutes to write. I am very anxious to give this place a fair trial before I can think of leaving it. I feel a great deal discouraged just now about means. It will cost me $35 at least to fix this house so we can live in it - twice as much as I expected when we began. We have raised the house as to have a story and a half and put on a new roof. The old shingles we use for a floor upstairs. These shingles are oak 3 feet long, 1\/2 inch thick. Our lower floor is made of puncheons. These puncheons are made out of a tree, sawed about 5 feet long, and then split into thick slabs, and hewed down with a broadaxe. First summer we had no door or window. Now we will have a door made out of the oak shingles put that two split sticks, clapboard fashion, hung perhaps on wood? hinges, like your garden gate. That's the way they do here. Today I have almost made a bargain buying some? nails, 1200 at $1.50 a hundred. This will take a good share of the money you have let me have, and I shall then be in debt for a good share of the improvement on my house. I think I shall get the nails unclear from half a dollar to a dollar cheaper than they are selling nails here, and I must have them, and do not see how - I can split the. We are expecting some assistance from Father Colegrove this spring. I hope we can get help enough to get through the summer. I am afraid of burdening you too much, but if you can borrow a little for me, I think I could return it without doubt in a few years and pay the interest as it comes due. I am afraid you will think I am asking a great deal, particularly as you are so anxious we should return. It would be a very grievous and heavy discouragement to have to go back now. We can get along here now with a great deal less that we can start with any where else. We are not alarmed on account of the Missourians. The cruel outrages you read of in the papers take place generally (excepting the Lawrence difficulties) near slaveholding or proslavery settlement. These are mainly north of the Kansas river. The community here are overwhelmingly freestate. The Congress commission it is hoped will do us good, and lead to good for us. O that the free states would for once unite, and raise the banner of liberty for Kansas! Is that too much to expect?\nLove to all at home\nJohn\ntop margin:\nAm sorry to hear Robert does not improve more rapidly. I intended to have written to him by this mail but must now leave it till the next mail. It did me a great deal of good to get a letter from Robert. I feel uneasy because I have not answered his letter, but we felt bound to keep up our weekly communication with home and I have been very busy with the house the past fortnight, Send me a newspaper with a current slate in it. If you see any body coming out of Kansas send me some roots and slips.

Hope you will not be worried about us, I feel no apprehension here, sleep as soundly at night as if no one wished or intended to cut my throat. \n  S.M.C.E","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":35602,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/35602","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e044aeb9d256d8ef7b6a61144256be08.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e044aeb9d256d8ef7b6a61144256be08.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e044aeb9d256d8ef7b6a61144256be08.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e044aeb9d256d8ef7b6a61144256be08.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T19:32:40+00:00","modified":"2020-08-15T17:58:04+00:00","filename":"e044aeb9d256d8ef7b6a61144256be08.jpg","authentication":"dcd82f0741d09ea3b5970d4848f41ee7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_02_fl_111_006_01_o2.jpg","size":1051897,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2302,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042310108762107},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["040801"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["040801"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["040801"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e044aeb9d256d8ef7b6a61144256be08.jpg","FileDateTime":1507750278,"FileSize":1051897,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2302\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2302,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"9mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:03:03 15:24:18","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:02 04:08:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:02 04:08:01","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1488,"ExifImageLength":2327,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":153,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/153","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Osawatomie April 8, 1866\n\nDear Cynthia,\n\n I received your very welcome letter last Thursday a week and a day after it was dated.

My cold is very much better. The prospect is that I shall stop with our two long-time friends Frederick Nygant and Mr Snow this summer. Fred. is a German, thoroughly Americanized, and a large-hearted friendly whole-souled fellow, with the ladies very bashful and awkward, but quite sensible of the important fact that he wants a wife, and don't hardly know how to get her. He owns to twenty nine years. Mr Snow is a Vermont Yankee. So here we are\n\nI think that I had wrote that I had bought a cow. Have been trying to get horses & wagon, but have not suited myself yet.

And you must not think that I hate to write to you but that I not like to write - hic labor hoc opus est. (Is the Latin right?) We received your letter to Mr Edward W. Everett last Saturday night. You may well believe that the young gentleman's eyes sparkled, and that his countenance was full of life when he heard that there was a letter directed to him. Eddy is getting to be quite mischievous - full of play, fun and laughter. He don't get whipped half so much as I used to when I was his age. Perhaps it would be better for him if he was. You see I am writing something foolish because I have nothing special to write about. Perhaps we are all better off when we have nothing particular to say about ourselves. If I had cut the little finger of my left hand off or if Sarah had scratched her arm or if Eddy had pinched his finger till he squealed right out, or if Henry had caught a bad cold so that he could not hardly talk - then there would be something to write about. But as it is, all we have to say especially is very good news. Sarah is getting better! I think she really is. She looks better - sits up more - suffers less pain, and feels very much encouraged. She has been using Dr. Filch's remedies now nearly four weeks. (Father has just come in to offer me 2 cents for writing to you. Totally unexpected! Virtue its own reward is it not?)

My health is improving rather slowly but I trust as surely. I think Dr. Fitch understands my case much better than Dr. Guiteau did, at least his medicines do me much more good. The supporters and braces which he sent me are just the things they help me very much indeed I do not think I could be cured without them. I take seven different kinds of medicine each day most of which I take three times a day besides pills and linament to rub on my back and as I am not able to help myself you will percieve that I am a good deal of trouble for mother. but I hope soon to be able to go around and wait on myself. (then I will write to you often, very often!) My back seems to be slower \"in getting well\" than anything else. Those \"cruel blisters\" are now quite well, leaving only a slight scar to remind us of there once-painful existance. I am now able to sit supported up in bed four or five hours in the day and sometimes 15 minutes or half an hour in the chair. I cannot walk any yet. I am yet in the study. Do you remember, dearest Jane, who carried into this room! and do you know, sweet sister, that I have not passed through the door since you bore me through, is not this a tender thought. Oh sister Jane, would that you could be with me now! Would that I could take the bitter medicine from your hand, how much of its bitterness would be gone and how soothing to my aching head would be a pillow smoothed by my own absent sister! but I do not repine it is all for the best.

Robert has been doing very well in Utica lately, much better than in the summer. We have been expecting him to come to Remsen all winter, but he is not here yet and perhaps will not be for some time. As long as he is doing a good business in Utica I suppose he will stay there, at least for the present.

I was truly glad to get a few lines from you again.  I send you a specimen in this of the red-legged locust of which I have written before.  This is the female.  The two points which project behind it uses to bore holes in the ground to deposit eggs.  They seem to choose the hardest spots to lay their eggs, like places where cattle have tramped near farm houses.  Their eggs are still alive.  I have heard this morning of a neighbor who has found some of the eggs and brought them into the house and laid them in a warm place, and he says in a very short time they hatch out and go to jumping.  The weather in the spring here is quite changeable.  Our hope is that there may come some warm weather in the spring to  hatch\n\nHow will the Cen. turn out this year. They are having hard times in the iron works which must affect it some Does Glycine help your Quinsy?

They were both spared to us to a good old age. They both left a bright example for us to follow. I pray that I may hereafter live more worthy of my opportunities. I have been much struck lately by reading an anecdote of a boy that went as a sailor. While new to the situation, he was sent up into the mast. His feet were on one rope and his hands clung to another above. While at this great height above the deck, a sudden move of the ship caused his feet to slip from the rope. He looked down for the rope, became dizzy, and was about to drop.

There are some black walnut trees growing right by our door. They make a very pleasant shade to sit under warm summer days.

While in the country last summer it so chanced that one day for the first time in their lives they saw a cow milked. \"There Willie,\" said Freddie, \"do you see that? I don't want any more milk after the cow has had it!\" That evening their milk was not touched. Freddie said he did not want any milk after the cow had had it. Willie then told of the discovery they had made that morning. The mother then explained that the milk did not come to them second hand - that the cow ate the grass, and that by the wonderful process of life such as the good God ordered the grass was changed into milk. This satisfied Willie, but Freddie still turned up his nose at milk. After supper Willie took his brother aside into the corner. \"It's all right. Freddie,\" said he. \"The cow eats grass, and that's what makes the milk. Now if the cow didn't -eat the grass you would have to, you see. That's what the cow is for.\" This satisfied the young philosopher, and he had no hesitation after that about drinking his milk. You are learning to make your letters better.

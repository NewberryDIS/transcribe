The weather keeps pretty cool yet-- but we have had some very warm days, which you may be sure I enjoyed. The hay has just held out, by buying 1\/2 ton. Last night the cows were out  for the first. We are raising only one calf-- a fine one they say, from the \"new cows.\" It has the white nose indicative of Jersey breed.

I did not mention it when i wrote, as I was getting along nicely-- and thought as you were so far away, I would not give you cause for unnecessary uneasiness. About four weeks ago I was taken with a slight hemmorhage only a little-- perhaps I had been overdoing and was exhausted-- so had to give  up more completely for a few days than I otherwise would. After two or three days I commenced having chills and sweatings-- so  thought I had better send for  Dr. Kingsbury as I had no one at  home but Alice and Mr. Jones. \n\nremaining words written sideways across top, perhaps a continuation from across the fold: sick-- both were attended by our good Dr. Kingsbury. Mrs. Robt R. Jones came up with him one day last week. Nellie has been quite poorly all winter-- but is better now. Hattie Jones is waiting patiently for an answer to her letter. Also Mrs. Parkhurst & Jane Hughes.

I will not go into the particulars, as cousin Jennie promised to write you about it after she went home.  I am gaining nicely every day now - sit up and walk around a good deal and this afternoon went to the garden and picked a beautiful boquet of asters, verbenas, phlox, ageratum, etc. though the wind was blowing pretty lively.  Dr Kingsbury has been to see me twice this week but does not consider it necessary to come again unless sent for.\n\n\nwhen the rest was in church.

Perhaps it is rheumatism.  Please tell me how she is when you write.  I hope that she and all the rest will keep from getting sick.  In my letter to Robbie the other day,  I spoke of Uncle Hughes' ill turn.  He is much better cousin Jennie writes me, so they hope he will recover from this.  He is not strong, and seems failing somewhat - still is generally comfortable and happy.  Of course he is cared for very tenderly by all the family.

Last night, the \nfirst part, she rested some better, \nwas again attacked with a coughing \nspell about the same time - she \nhad not raised much for some \ntime, and had a very hard time \ntrying to raise at that time.  She \nseemed brighter for a time","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}]

There is nothing merely accidental or occasional in this character; it is inherent. It has always been their distinction. One of the earliest historians of South Carolina and Georgia, in a work printed in 1777 at London, says of them, \"It may be remarked, that the Cherokees differ, in some respects, from other Indian nations that have wandered from place to place, and fixed their habitations in separate districts. From time immemorial they have had possession of the same territory, which at present they occupy. They affirm that their forefathers sprung from that ground, or descended from the clouds upon those hills.

No land in the world could equal it in attractiveness to them. With evidence of this their history overflows. I will give an instance from among the anecdotes of the elder Ridge in the large work entitled \"The Indian Tribes of North America.\" The story exhibits a remarkable contrast with that later course which led to his destruction.

I will give some of the leading particulars of it.\nBefore this event took place, the policy of removing all Indians from within the United States to an ample district west of the Mississippi and without the limits of any state or territory, had been so determined on the part of our government, that there was no longer any delicacy whatever in relation to the means by which it was to be attempted. The Cherokees and their neighbors the Creeks watched all movements on this subject with extreme jealousy. In 1822, congress had, at the instance of Georgia, made certain appropriations and had appointed commissioners, for the purchases of the Cherokee territory.

See Footnote The Treaty thus formed and signed by John Ridge, Menawee and others, opens with the following memorable preamble: See Footnote \"Whereas a treaty was concluded at the Indian Springs, on the twelfth day of February last, between commissioners on the part of the United States and a portion of the Creek nation, by which an extensive district of country was ceded to the United States: And whereas a great majority of the chiefs and warriors of the said nation have protested against the execution of the said treaty, and have represented that the same was signed on their part by persons having no sufficient authority\nFootnote Indian Treaties, Washington, 1837, pages 394 & 5.\nFootnote Ibid, page 391.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71056,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71056","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/2c82f8889451a31473e9ff2586e6f5c3.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/2c82f8889451a31473e9ff2586e6f5c3.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/2c82f8889451a31473e9ff2586e6f5c3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2c82f8889451a31473e9ff2586e6f5c3.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:57:33+00:00","modified":"2020-04-28T02:27:31+00:00","filename":"2c82f8889451a31473e9ff2586e6f5c3.jpg","authentication":"15d1fb6ab9dad5286758602ed8894b1e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL06_00119_o2.jpg","size":435296,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2379,"compression_ratio":0.033884140550807},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["035325+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["035325+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["035325+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"2c82f8889451a31473e9ff2586e6f5c3.jpg","FileDateTime":1522425414,"FileSize":435296,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2379\"","Height":2379,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2379,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:14:20","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3479},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 03:53:25","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 03:53:25","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":32,"SubSecTimeOriginal":32,"SubSecTimeDigitized":32,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2379,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1056,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1056","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"authority to form treaties or to make cessions, and that the stipulations in the said treaty, are, therefore, wholly void.

There occurs in his early history a second instance of the acts of his more Roman days. It is described with strong panegyric in the account supplied by his son for the work already quoted, on \"The Indian Tribes of North America.\" The anecdote I mean is of the death of Doublehead, a great Cherokee orator, who, in 1806, when attended by a regular delegation, made a Treaty which the bulk of the Cherokees considered as contravening their instructions. In this Treaty Doublehead had secured a reservation for himself & a few friends of about ten miles square, in the region now including the Alabama town of Florence. He had proceeded, with the rest, to parcel out the reservation & sell it to the whites. This aggravated the public exasperation. His offence was not punished, but it was not forgotten. When a new encroachment was sought soon afterwards, the people believed that Doublehead meant to favor it. He had gone to the neighborhood of the site where Calhoun now stands, to meet the United States Commissioners on the subject.

They followed him to the place of conference. They joined him in a log tavern kept by a Cherokee, where he and others were carousing. In the midst of the tumult of half drunken? voices, some one caught up the candle from a table and held it near the face of Doublehead. Major Ridge darted silently behind the candle, blew it out and at the same moment shot Doublehead through the cheek, near the lower part of the ear. He fell. There was suddenly great confusion, rendered greater by the darkness. All ran out, exclaiming \"Who did it? Who did it?\" But none could learn at the moment who did it. The Cherokee log tavern-keeper closed and barred the door. It was found that Doublehead had only been wounded; though it was a severe wound.

By towns is not to be understood a cluster of dwellings contained within a small space, as amongst the whites, and, probably, with some other Indian tribes; but a small colony, generally embracing some miles in extent. In the same sense, Cherokee village is to be understood. Every town is not a clan: Clans do not appear to depend on a certain number of towns or inhabitants; but seem to have originated in the manner that the numerous subdivisions amongst the Jews arose.\nThere are no natural boundaries to the clans, -- the subjects of different clans being mingled.

and killed several who were innocent of the theft or the murder and two or three days after this affair had happened the Little Turkey, who was then quite young man, as a Leader arrived with his party on the frontiers of the white settlement, with 20 or 30 men, who came to a house, and made signs to the white men, that he and party wished to stay all night about the place till the morrow, but the[y] indicated a hostile disposition towards them and made signs to them to go away; notwithstanding [which] the[y] continued at house or plantation all the might, yet not without suspecting that something may have happened more than what they knew of since the[y] had passed by; and left the house early, - and on their return home on Keowee River, found the reason of the hostile disposition of the white men at the house where they had staid all night on their way home by reason of the lives which the whites on the frontiers had taken of their people, and in consequence of which, the relatives at home retaliated on the whites living near the frontiers of South Carolina or Georgia, and in consequence of which the officers of the Garrison at Keowee called [a] meeting there of the principal head of those towns lying adjacent\/adjacant to that place, and a formal demand being\/bein made for the delivery of those who had committed the murder on the inhabitants of the adjacent settlement, upon which the head men either stipulated to give a direct answer to the demand, or refused to give up the murderers, as the particulars\/perticulars of the reply is not mentioned, but twelve or thirteen of the principal\/principle head men and warriors were detained in the Garrison as Hostages till\/tell the murderers were delivered up to the Garrison, and with these circumstances taking place at Keowee Garrison, brought about partially misunderstanding with Occunnostotoe's settlement & officers of the Garrison at Fort Loudon, which precluded the soldiers' going out and buying.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71125,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/71125","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/ad5da0c9b3d9ef5f0d22babc2469d9db.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/ad5da0c9b3d9ef5f0d22babc2469d9db.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/ad5da0c9b3d9ef5f0d22babc2469d9db.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ad5da0c9b3d9ef5f0d22babc2469d9db.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:58:30+00:00","modified":"2020-05-19T02:50:31+00:00","filename":"ad5da0c9b3d9ef5f0d22babc2469d9db.jpg","authentication":"18409a2432ce7052dfa7b4c992968447","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL07_FL001_00013_o2

They were received by the General Council as friends & brothers; and an appropriation of money was made to procure storage for their horses. After having showed them every friendship, we did not expect that William McIntosh had any ungenerous disposition towards the interest of this nation; but we were mistaken. We find that his visit here must have been entirely through speculative designs. He has used intriguing language with some of our Chiefs, to yield land to the United States\u2019 commissioners, who are now here for that object; and made promises of procuring a large sum of money from the United States\u2019 for them, in which he proposed to participate himself, for his trouble. His verbal suggestion, at first, was not taken notice of; but he still continued in the same course, and made a written communication to Mr. John Ross, the President of the National Committee, on the subject, promising the sum of nineteen thousand dollars paid over to such individuals as he may think proper, in case of a cession.

humble petitioners once more beg your attention to their grievances. Your petitioners have, from time to time, made them known to your honorable body, but have not, as yet, received an answer. We, as citizens of the Cherokee Nation, claim our right. We claim a right to the ferry at the junction of the Coosawatie & Conesaugee Rivers, from occupancy; which right is derived, agreably to the custom and usages and laws of our nation and none can produce a better. Now the privilege of this ferry is taken away from us by arbitrary or illegal authority by Alexander McCoy. We want you to take the case into serious consideration and examine it minutely & we are well assured that you will do us justice and give us our rights. If it was not an indisputable right we would not ask it; but all we want is justice, as we have had a ferry boat at the place, before said McCoy moved to this place with assurances sufficient that the case will be properly investigated, we subscribe our names. \n                                                                                 Jessee Halfbreed\n                                                                                 Bosanallie\n                                                                                 Jas P.

It really appears wonderful to see the river to the top of the bank.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":80228,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/80228","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/faff36ee168289856e4e54fce65bcf44.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/faff36ee168289856e4e54fce65bcf44.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/faff36ee168289856e4e54fce65bcf44.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/faff36ee168289856e4e54fce65bcf44.jpg"},"added":"2018-12-06T23:28:13+00:00","modified":"2019-11-04T21:55:19+00:00","filename":"faff36ee168289856e4e54fce65bcf44.jpg","authentication":"b39b57d663add101ffc6b6b3cd6a0058","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3157_FL002_00027_o2 copy.jpg","size":758309,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1591,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044131864422562},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["134613+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120627"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["134613+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120627"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["134613+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120627"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"faff36ee168289856e4e54fce65bcf44.jpg","FileDateTime":1544138844,"FileSize":758309,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1591\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":1591,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"10mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3059,"ImageLength":3600,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:12:06 11:52:49","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3632},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:27 13:46:13","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:27 13:46:13","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":5,"SubSecTimeDigitized":5,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1591,"ExifImageLength":3600,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1141,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1141","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"and farms dwindling(?) in rear it appears like looking off into a valley.

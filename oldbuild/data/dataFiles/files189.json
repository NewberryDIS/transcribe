Or is it because it requires too great an effort? if it requires a greater effort; that is a proof to my mind of its beneficial effects.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43372,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43372","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/78d307a5604c0128430974b892bd3ddb.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/78d307a5604c0128430974b892bd3ddb.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/78d307a5604c0128430974b892bd3ddb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/78d307a5604c0128430974b892bd3ddb.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T17:13:36+00:00","modified":"2020-05-23T19:13:43+00:00","filename":"78d307a5604c0128430974b892bd3ddb.jpg","authentication":"1dd082a5ea16eeeb426db5f0c94ef28a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_05_fl_106_003_006_o2.jpg","size":1090790,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2731,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.03698245114393},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170809"],"TimeCreated":["231149"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170809"],"TimeCreated":["231149"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170809"],"TimeCreated":["231149"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"78d307a5604c0128430974b892bd3ddb.jpg","FileDateTime":1509469957,"FileSize":1090790,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2731\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2731,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:10 10:52:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:09 23:11:49","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:09 23:11:49","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2861,"ExifImageLength":3770,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":189,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/189","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The effort which is made to produce something of this kind brings into action the latent energies which when thus brought out, shine as much brighter as gold dust when dug from the earth and purified.

I would have written to you before but I have been waiting to find something that would be interesting to you. I started from New Orleans on the Balpool and sailed in a south easterly direction to Isthmus of Darien, It is a beautiful place, it is 15 miles wide.

As an excuse for not engaging in conversation people sometimes say that they are not able to converse as well as other, if they are not they never will be unless there is some effort on their part to become so. Though it requires some effort to do this yet the benefits which result more than recompense anyone for his trouble, his own personal happiness is greatly increased and he is able to accomplish a much greater amount of good than he otherwise could, for as he understand and those who listen cannot fail to comprehend what is meant without the trouble of trying to solve the puzzling enigmas in which those persons are obliged to express themselves who are not accustomed to expressing their ideas frequently. The great end and aim of all seems to be happiness and as the power to converse will greatly increase our happiness it is strange that there is not a greater effort made to secure this treasure.

Our reason tells us that it is necessary that this arrangement of things should be as it is in order to effect those results which it is desirable should be effected for man's enjoyment. Therefore when we take into consideration the great end which is accomplished by means of these at first sight unpleasant changes, then it is that we feel not only perfectly resigned to the change, but see many beauties about it that inspire in us feelings kindred to those called forth by the sight of those beautiful scenes which meet our vision when all nature is teeming with life and beauty.

Though in Autumn all vegetable matter passes into an apparently lifeless state it is only a temporary one, and when the proper requisites for its life and growth are brought around it, the buds come forth and then the leaves till finally the fields, hills and groves teem again with life and beauty. How delightful the change! We tire of sameness and would not know how to prize so many rich blessings unless deprived of them for a time. The growth and perfection of a plant depends entirely upon the influences by which it is surrounded. The farmer aware of this fact throws around the seed which he places in the ground all those influences which will effect their growth. If he fail to do this he finds that his Autumn is a fruitless one, that instead of being blessed with a rich harvest that his seed has been worse than thrown away, that instead of a plentious board his family are starving for bread. Youth has been compared to Spring and Manhood to Autumn. There is so very striking a resemblance that it cannot fail to be seen by the observer. If anyone neglect in youth to cultivate his mind, to get that instruction which is necessary for the growth and perfection of his mental, moral and affectionate being his Autumn of life will fail to be a pleasant one. He will find alas! too late that in order to have old pleasant that a store of knowledge must be laid up beforehand upon which to feast, that all the passions must be kept in subjection or they will like thorns and thistles root out all the better fruit, but when our bodies, which like all natural substances must undergo decomposition are worn out and laid low then will we like the plants spring forth into a brighter and more lovely existence where there will be no unfavorable influences to retard our progress in a knowledge of all those things which will make us virtuous and happy. \nJ.C.

It is among those who are deprived of the means of obtaining luxuries for those who revel amid scenes where no energy is required, where nothing is to be done but to indulge in the gratification of all those desires which have a tendency to degenerate men are rendered stupid and unfit for the more refined employment of exercising the imagination. When seated as am I want to be under a thatched roof with no room made comfortable by a warm fire which I can call my own and with no furniture but such as is absolutely necessary and no wardrobe of silk and satin but one consisting only of such things as are most economical whether they exactly suit the fancy of their owner or not. It is then that the imagination takes its flights. Ah! It is people who are deprived of comforts and who have to exert themselves for all that they obtain that know how to appreciate the blessings which are bestowed on them.

How often do we notice the conversation of persons who have not met for many year turn upon something that happened at the time of their acquaintance though it might have commenced on a subject the most remote from it. This is in consequence of the deep impressions made on the mind at the time and the principle of the association. The presence of this old acquaintance bring to mind all the former scenes in which they both participated, and the memory of these past scenes being pleasant each individual is kindly looked upon as a contribution to the happiness of the other and in this way an attachment is formed which is very endearing. We often notice the effects which are produced by the principle of associated in foreigners. When foreigners that never met before meet in this country, they feel that they are meeting in the presence of old friends who can appreciate their worth and in whom they can confide; in fact those who can understand their feelings. This can be very easily accounted for by considering that as a nation they are bound together by lasting ties, and that they have the same interests, hence the congeniality of feeling that exists. \nIt is true that the love for the human race exists in different degrees in different individuals, but it is supposed that all are naturally philanthropic, notwithstanding habits and dispositions may be formed that will cause enmity to exist towards all mankind.

March of Life\nHow smoothly and happily do some persons move through life, while others are continually stumbling and hobbling along as though they thought the road almost impassable or at least very rough. To what is this attributable? Is the fault ours or is some one else to blame? When we stop to consider for a moment we answer that it rests with ourselves whether our march be one of ease and happiness or one of pain and misery. The March of Life may be compared to a long journey through pleasant valleys and over steep hills, through dreary wastes and peopled cities. In order that a journey of this kind may be pleasant and agreeable the traveler must be equipped for it, must be prepared to brave all the dangers to which he may be exposed.

They tell of the beauty of submission to the Divine will and say that the heart never wearies but still looks forward to a bright and glorious time even though the physical powers are the tasked with more than they can bear, that though storms may gather around, though sorrows and pains may bear upon the mind, yet that the bright rays of hope are still able to shine forth and prevent clouds from gathering on the brow, that sorrow teaches wisdom, renders the soul more pure and tells it to speed on in its endeavors to attain that degree of perfection which shall make it worthy of a position among the brightest and most glorious things of earth.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43428,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43428","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/906e7cae82927d0b402757b56c1d05d4.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/906e7cae82927d0b402757b56c1d05d4.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/906e7cae82927d0b402757b56c1d05d4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/906e7cae82927d0b402757b56c1d05d4.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T17:16:40+00:00","modified":"2020-05-23T21:40:51+00:00","filename":"906e7cae82927d0b402757b56c1d05d4.jpg","authentication":"f5792ae8729fd44ceff10d0d517b2b38","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_05_fl_107_012_001_o2.jpg","size":1374909,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2890,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044050653594771},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["040740"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["040740"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["040740"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"906e7cae82927d0b402757b56c1d05d4.jpg","FileDateTime":1509469959,"FileSize":1374909,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2890\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2890,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:10 16:39:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:10 04:07:40","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:10 04:07:40","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3070,"ExifImageLength":3824,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":189,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/189","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Musings\nAfter a warm and sultry day, spent in endeavoring to learn lessons, but which I found impossible on account of the weather I wandered forth to enjoy the cool and quiet of the evening I soon released from my mind the less pleasant transactions of the day and was wholly absorbed in thought, finding it less difficult to learn lessons from nature than from books. It was a beautiful evening. The balmy breeze of the evening contrasted well with the close air of the day. I prolonged by walk till I reached the shore of a beautiful stream where I was impelled by the beauties by which I found myself surrounded to stop. While gazing around, first upon the clear water which reflected the moon and glittering stars, disturbed here and there by fishes coming up to get a little more air. Then at the silvery moon, which shone with more than ordinary splendor surrounded by thousands of stars, and listening to the evening song of the whipperwill which could be distinctly heard, I thought that surely that scene could be interpreted as easily as thought it were written in language. It spoke volumes and it was very pleasant to the ears of one who was thirsting for knowledge, who was desirous of learning whether regarding science, morality or religion. \nIt has been said that \"Grace, beauty, and sunshine are preeminent satellites in the moral world\" it was recalled to my mind on beholding this scene.

Am important lesson may be learned from them it is to be modest, never to be guilty of acting rudely or in an ostentatious manner, to retire from the presence of the gifted and noble or at least not to crowd ourselves or rather our opinions which from our limited knowledge are not worthy of as much notice upon them, to always allow those most capable of judging to express themselves first.

All animate creation can according to the laws of nature exist but a few short years at most.\n     Flowers bloom in all their beauty and loveliness for a time, long enough to accomplish their work and then fade and finally drop from their stems and pass into different forms to bloom again when their season returns.  More hardened plants and trees retain their beauty longer but time which ne'er forgets to set its withering blast upon all created things comes and makes them feeble and unable to withstand the raging tempests longer, and so they fall to the ground and there decay or pass into different forms which are very useful in furnishing food and nourishment to surrounding objects.\n     We see that it is the same with man.  When we reflect upon the past scenes of our lives we observe that many individuals who participated in our pleasures and who sympathized with us in our bereavements have already passed away while others have not yet gone but their beauty has departed and they are only waiting for the time when their souls shall take their flights to realms on high where the strong hopes which they entertain here of meeting their loved friends","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43433,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43433","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/26915bbcecbb930b853c54ea6c449033.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/26915bbcecbb930b853c54ea6c449033.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/26915bbcecbb930b853c54ea6c449033.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/26915bbcecbb930b853c54ea6c449033.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T17:16:57+00:00","modified":"2020-04-12T00:41:18+00:00","filename":"26915bbcecbb930b853c54ea6c449033.jpg","authentication":"e2172e4aa828797ce9af92ffe10522bb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_05_fl_107_013_002_o2.jpg","size":1474948,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2837,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048138617997624},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["040818"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["040818"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["040818"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"26915bbcecbb930b853c54ea6c449033.jpg","FileDateTime":1509469959,"FileSize":1474948,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2837\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2837,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:10 16:40:05","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:10 04:08:18","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:10 04:08:18","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":12,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3009,"ExifImageLength":3817,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":189,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/189","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"shall be realized and where we are assured there will be no more troubles, cares or trials to disturb their peace and happiness and so of course nothing to make them fade or become less attractive.

By constant practice we form habits of walking, talking and writing that characterize us at all times, by which characteristics our acquaintances are able to recognize us. The facility with which some learn to repeat passages and the ease with which some appear on the stage both declaiming and reading compositions is to be attributed to habit. Though genius and a moderate share of self esteem is requisite to a good speaker and writer, they are wasted unless we habituate ourselves to speaking and reading before the public. For instance let two individuals equally talented, one in the habit of appearing before the public and the other not, be called upon to deliver a lecture; one would appear graceful and easy in his manners while the other would appear awkward and therefor uninteresting. The sense of touch, taste, smell, hearing and sight can be cultivated by practice so as to serve various purposes for which without cultivation they are wholly unfit. By the loss of one of the senses the others are called into use and are thereby brought to a greater state of perfection. Those who are deprived of the sense of sight cultivate the touch till it becomes so nice that they may without fear traverse grounds that they have been over and go through the house and find anything they may wish being able to distinguish their own things from others though they appear just alike\nN8","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43435,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43435","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c9fb6b5946253ca17eed0da06e609e39.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c9fb6b5946253ca17eed0da06e609e39.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c9fb6b5946253ca17eed0da06e609e39.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c9fb6b5946253ca17eed0da06e609e39.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T17:17:03+00:00","modified":"2020-05-23T21:46:02+00:00","filename":"c9fb6b5946253ca17eed0da06e609e39.jpg","authentication":"365b1c6b1ee959fec8b00faedfc2e55b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_05_fl_107_014_002_o2.jpg","size":1527754,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2942,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048082496160334},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["040835"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["040835"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["040835"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c9fb6b5946253ca17eed0da06e609e39.jpg","FileDateTime":1509469959,"FileSize":1527754,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2942\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2942,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:10 16:40:10","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:10 04:08:35","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:10 04:08:35","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3098,"ExifImageLength":3790,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":189,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/189","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The blind can by feeling read in which case they substitute the fingers for the eyes.

In this point of view the law of habit may be considered as of great benefit to the human race. But there is another view which may be taken of this law which leads to different and sometimes unpleasant results. The taste becomes more delicate by use. It will enable persons to distinguish the flavors of different dishes when there is but a very nice distinction. The taste becomes vitiated by habitual use of anything that is stimulating as may be seen in the users of tobacco, snuff or ardent spirits. Anyone who meddle with any of these will become their slaves and devote the rest of his life, whether it be one or fifty years to their service.

For want of a knowledge of their history save such as I have gained from the perusal of a few books I am obliged to offer you nothing better than the following which is an attempt to condense the history of the Grecians and the Persians from 521 B. C till 478 B. C, the space of forty eight years. Darius was known by the name of Ochus before his reign but his name was changed to Darius signifying an avenger on account of the manner in which he treated the Magian impostor whom he finally succeeded in destroying. He reigned thirty years. Darius is mentioned in history as having several wives one before his ascension to the throne by whom he had a son; Artobarzanes who afterwards disputed the throne with Xerxes. It must be borne in mind that Darius did not come in possession of the throne by heirship or in consequence of his virtues but it was agreed upon by the conspirators against the Magian Impostor that he whose horse neighed first on a certain day should be king; Darius groom procured the honor for his master by means which he took for that purpose. The king, feeling grateful for the favor erected an equestrian stature upon which was inscribed, \"Darius the son of Hystaspes acquired the king of Persia by means of his horse (whose name was inscribed and that of his groom.\" The Persian Empire was very extensive at this time including several countries belonging to Europe Asia and Africa. When Darius was seated on the throne his first action was in reference to dividing the Empire into districts which he designed according to their wealth at the same time using great care to appear to do all in his power for the good of his subjects and also not to displease them by taxing them too heavily, but the Persians did not like his proceedings and gave him a name which signifies something more mean and contemptible than merchant while Cyrus and Cambyses were surnamed by","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43439,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43439","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/efd57f3ad7717a8580b9dbdfd072d438.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/efd57f3ad7717a8580b9dbdfd072d438.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/efd57f3ad7717a8580b9dbdfd072d438.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/efd57f3ad7717a8580b9dbdfd072d438.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T17:17:15+00:00","modified":"2020-05-23T21:59:43+00:00","filename":"efd57f3ad7717a8580b9dbdfd072d438.jpg","authentication":"0172052a5c8d4161c512da1269997432","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_05_fl_107_015_002_o2.jpg","size":1249612,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2257,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051264871428806},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["222453"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["222453"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["222453"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"efd57f3ad7717a8580b9dbdfd072d438.jpg","FileDateTime":1509469959,"FileSize":1249612,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2257\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2257,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:11 09:56:28","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:10 22:24:53","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:10 22:24:53","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3105,"ExifImageLength":4951,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":189,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/189","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"the same people father and master.

Miltiades was the able general on this occasion his army consisted of bold, intrepid men who loved liberty and dreaded slavery and tyranny more than death.

Miltiades was not long treated kindly by the Athenians but was condemned to death being suspected of treachery. He was commuted afterwards and fined the sum of 50 talents not being able to pay was imprisoned which soon caused his death. There seemed to be much doubt of his guilt but the Athenians were desirous of disposing of him for fear his great fame and merit might enable him to gain such power over them as would cause them trouble forgetting his former services they punished him in this unjust manner.

Mardonius was left with 300,000 men to perform the work that more than 1,000,000 could not do. Mardonius tried to tempt the Athenians with beautiful presents but they informed him that nothing would tempt them to give up their liberty.

She feels that the bond of affection which unites kindred hearts is similar to a chain composed entirely of golden links\nN6.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43447,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43447","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4487a8c392d799e2e14399bdb143ba76.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4487a8c392d799e2e14399bdb143ba76.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4487a8c392d799e2e14399bdb143ba76.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4487a8c392d799e2e14399bdb143ba76.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T17:17:37+00:00","modified":"2020-05-24T03:25:51+00:00","filename":"4487a8c392d799e2e14399bdb143ba76.jpg","authentication":"039440bad3904a76ec1f26a8a450cba2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_05_fl_107_016_002_o2.jpg","size":1174537,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2755,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.039474927740808},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["041016"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["041016"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["041016"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4487a8c392d799e2e14399bdb143ba76.jpg","FileDateTime":1509469960,"FileSize":1174537,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2755\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2755,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"13mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:10 16:40:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:10 04:10:16","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:10 04:10:16","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2190,"ExifImageLength":2861,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":189,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/189","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"which naught can sever and which affliction strengthen even as rubbing causes gold to brighten.

Though all are supposed to possess feeling of kindness under favorable circumstances, yet it is a lamentable fact that the pleasure and happiness which result from its exercise is too seldom felt by the majority of mankind; even professed christians are sometimes in need of its beneficial influence. The human race placed here on the earth as one common family, having the same Father, and are constituted alike moral and accountable beings, alike liable to err and even if they occupy different stations in the world they all have to be laid in the same last narrow resting place. As it pleased out Heavenly Father this place his creatures may we not support that was also his design that they should live as bothers, seeking the interest, happiness and advancement of each other?

In order to secure happiness which is our being's end and aim it is necessary to cultivate feelings of kindness. It will not only contribute to the happiness of your associates but to our own. It is the best instrument by which to gain the esteem and respect of others, to make warm and true friends, to make home pleasant and attractive. Kindness is first exercised in the domestic circle and is there most beautiful. A family whose constant rule of action is kindness will have a home that may be considered as a fair type of that one to which we are all journeying. Members or such families will not have to go abroad for society and thus fall into bad habits and become degraded but they bid fair to become ornaments to society.

Therefore I say that he who would enjoy life must develop those powers which have been implanted in him in such a manner that he may be susceptible of experiencing pleasant emotions whenever an opportunity is offered, It is obvious that by cultivating our reasoning faculties a great amount of pleasure will result to us which could be obtained in no other way and when once we experience that pleasure we would not part with the power by which \nN12","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43462,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43462","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/4a87bcafe301963e019bb48656a5c749.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/4a87bcafe301963e019bb48656a5c749.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/4a87bcafe301963e019bb48656a5c749.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4a87bcafe301963e019bb48656a5c749.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T17:18:28+00:00","modified":"2020-04-15T20:49:08+00:00","filename":"4a87bcafe301963e019bb48656a5c749.jpg","authentication":"c6ea30888743fdd6a02618d80b75517b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_05_fl_107_018_002_o2.jpg","size":1534765,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2851,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049844921210232},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["041148"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["041148"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["041148"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4a87bcafe301963e019bb48656a5c749.jpg","FileDateTime":1509469960,"FileSize":1534765,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2851\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2851,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:10 16:41:18","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:10 04:11:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:10 04:11:48","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3050,"ExifImageLength":3851,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":189,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/189","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"it was obtained for any price.

The passions become stronger as they are gratified and it is out of the power of fortune to render those happy who are corrupt and full of ungodly passions.\nOur every day experience furnishes us with instances which go to prove the truth of what has been said namely that when envy hatred malice or any of the evil passions exist within it an impossible for that person to be happy through surrounded by all that wealth can listen and also that pure happiness can be found where fortune has not smiled if the mind is nicely adorned with virtuous and contended feelings.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43466,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43466","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/a2730a17837bd1e9e8e46c59da6acc18.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/a2730a17837bd1e9e8e46c59da6acc18.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/a2730a17837bd1e9e8e46c59da6acc18.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a2730a17837bd1e9e8e46c59da6acc18.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T17:18:43+00:00","modified":"2020-05-24T03:58:21+00:00","filename":"a2730a17837bd1e9e8e46c59da6acc18.jpg","authentication":"021c399cc0d8ba43ccd04625a2a1ca81","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_05_fl_107_019_002_o2.jpg","size":1328643,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2864,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042954783519553},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["041211"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["041211"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["041211"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a2730a17837bd1e9e8e46c59da6acc18.jpg","FileDateTime":1509469960,"FileSize":1328643,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2864\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2864,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:10 16:41:28","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:10 04:12:11","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:10 04:12:11","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3036,"ExifImageLength":3816,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":189,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/189","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"It is no uncommon thing to see those whom fortune has smiled upon, living amid all that wealth can bestow, deprived of no luxuries, at liberty to spend their time as they will with servants to do their bidding wretched, with nothing peaceful or happy about them, time hanging heavily over them, and we often hear them complaining of their lot, considering it a hard one to be borne, and who ought to complain if not those with heavy hearts and uncontented dispositions for they are so very burdensome.

Virtue like the sun shines not by borrowed light but actually contains the substance, which makes it appear so bright, lovely, and attractive, and like the sun sends its rays upon other bodies to gladden them with its gentle radiance. Notwithstanding it is so very beautiful and attractive and is so universally admired by all in every land yet it is often banished from the presence of individuals of high standing.They can but admire it in others but strive not to obtain it for themselves.\nEveryone has within him the seeds of every virtue and it depends upon the soil in which he places them, the nourishment which he gives them and the care which he bestows upon them whether they grow to perfection or become stinted at an early day. As every one has been provided with the seeds of every virtue is it not a duty devolving upon him to nourish those seeds in the best manner possible, to provide suitable soil for their growth and to watch over them with the most vigilant care lest they be uprooted or demolished?\nIf they be neglected, the most unhappy results will be the consequence but with proper cultivation they will soon sprout and continue to grow in beauty and strength and will shine forth as brilliant diadems through life. The most effectual method of bringing them to perfection is seldom well understood. To the inexperienced the course which it is necessary to take in order to bring the flower to perfection appears difficult, it appears to have too many windings but this is owing to a want of attention, to negligence or a desire to try some other way.

But where are those seeds to be nourished and the flowers reared? In solitude? Do we see the choicest flowers growing alone, isolated from all of their kind? No, they are to be found in groups either in garden on hillside or wherever it has pleased the Creator to place them. A flower never thrives when alone it seems to be in need of something, which it has not, it wants something to live for of the same kind with itself, it is the same with the Amaranthine flower, Virtuous is is impossible for it to become as beautiful when reared in solitude as in society for there selfish was would be constantly hindering it in its onward progress while society seems exactly adapted to its nourishment and perfection.The love and regard felt for those around whether they be relatives, friends or acquaintances inspires feelings of purity and holiness. The depth of the soul is fathomed and whatever of good is found there is brought forth and by constant use becomes strengthened and thus by mingling in society all that is good and virtuous belonging to our natures is encouraged till it becomes after awhile an easy thing to adhere strictly to virtue. It is in society that we meet our friends and cultivate an attachment for them and the stronger these feelings of attachment are the greater is the desire to be worthy of their love and esteem. Where such feelings reign in the heart there is no danger of haughty pride intruding for love, hope and all that is gentle occupies the ground and pride does not like their company. It is the same with every vice, they wish not the company of the virtues, hence they enter not those places where the virtues reign. Such beings are constituted for friends and always have many, the society in which they mingle is made up of friends , and how delightful it is to be surrounded by them to know that there are those around who can sympathize with us if sorrows depress or can rejoice with us if bright prospects elate us. When doing a praiseworthy act we can feel that we will not be flattered for it but that whatever comes to our ears of commendation is sent to encourage us in the good cause in which we are engaged and it rebuked for doing wrong (as a true friend will never fail to do so) how welcome is it received. Society is the true sphere in which to cherish the virtues as there the strongest and most lasting friendships are found, consequently, there is the place where all that is noble and good is displayed and all that is wicked and unbecoming is refrained from, where all passions and emotions that are not characteristic of a lady or gentleman are subdued. True the members of all societies are not equally characterized morality and virtue but that it has a tendency to foster them must be evident and that all are not thus affected who mingle in it or have been thrown into bad society and from want of discernment pursued the wrong till now it is difficult for the, to break off their bad habits. The beneficial effects produced by society are great. It enables many to undergo severe trials and resist strong Temptations in order to be worthy members of the society to which they belong.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43469,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43469","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/07719b1ac50d7a9291c52642cebdb87a.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/07719b1ac50d7a9291c52642cebdb87a.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/07719b1ac50d7a9291c52642cebdb87a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/07719b1ac50d7a9291c52642cebdb87a.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T17:18:54+00:00","modified":"2020-05-24T04:11:25+00:00","filename":"07719b1ac50d7a9291c52642cebdb87a.jpg","authentication":"5d04d0f52daf2d1f6c8984c6ff37ecd8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_05_fl_107_021_001_o2.jpg","size":1383505,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2873,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04458834487115},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["041232"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["041232"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["041232"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"07719b1ac50d7a9291c52642cebdb87a.jpg","FileDateTime":1509469960,"FileSize":1383505,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2873\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2873,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:10 16:41:36","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:10 04:12:32","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:10 04:12:32","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3064,"ExifImageLength":3838,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":189,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/189","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"A Visit to Blannerhasset's Island \nSome young people were desirous of having a hay day celebration, accordingly they made preparations to go upon Blannerhasset's Island. Having assembled at the proper time and place they all crossed the river together; some to visit that celebrated Island for the first time and to actually see the ground on which once stood the palace of Blannerhasset. Thus remains nothing to speak of its former beauty as it was destroyed by fire many years ago and no one of the family was left in these parts to keep the yard in order, so it grew up to weeds trees etc. But there is a well the remains of a gatepost and a cellar to be seen which we examined carefully and then made our way to some trees under whose shade we rested and chose our Queen, one whom every one thought beautiful and accomplished enough to receive the crown which was a wreath of wild flowers that we gathered upon the Island. The Queen was but seventeen years old and yet she seemed to be matured in mind and body.

But apparently the greatest source of pleasure to them was music in which they were both proficient. The daughter played on the harp and sung while the father accompanied with the violin for our entertainment; we enjoyed it very much but as it was getting late we were under the necessity of leaving though urged to remain. We prevailed on the daughter to accompany us to out retreat where we had some refreshments of which everyone partook with alacrity as our appetite had become quite good after our long ramble. While partaking of these refreshments this daughter said she was very well contented with her situation, that she had no desire to live in any more public place for she knew that she should not be able to appreciate her friends as she now did for she would have an opportunity to see them often and she feared she would not have so much time to devote to intellectual pursuits.

If it promise a universal education surely it must be plain and easily comprehended.

Behold the fierce tiger an how subdued and rendered as obedient as a little child by a being far weaker than itself. It is knowledge and not strength that renders man capable of accomplishing such things.

In every nation this propensity may be seen existing though contrary to the injunctions \"Whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God and love thy neighbor as thyself\". The conscience is the peoples guide on all occasions where right and wrong are considered; for it fells us whether we are actuated by selfish motives or the more benevolent spirit of the good of out fellowmen or the love of God.

It is used in the Scriptures in a very difficult sense from the one in which it is generally used by mankind. In the Scriptures Wisdom is always spoken of as a means by which good and happy results are effected, but we often hear those called wise who possess knowledge whether it be used for a good purpose or not. A very clear and comprehensive answer may be found in the following. Wisdom is light and reason. Anything composed of such valuable ingredients must naturally be very pure, lovely and attractive. For truth is the most precious of all things; it will make us free from that state of mind which is a debasing in its nature, and light is very essential in rendering the truths presented for consideration easily understood. Reason decides which is the best and surest course to take in order to secure the desired end which Wisdom always has in vision, good to all. Its ability is beautifully expressed in the following comparison. \"Wisdom resembles an open foundation whose waters are never sealed up but are kept constantly running for the benefit of all.\"\nN2","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43478,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43478","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/7c2222cb8e86eb1143ef78ba96c91370.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/7c2222cb8e86eb1143ef78ba96c91370.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/7c2222cb8e86eb1143ef78ba96c91370.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7c2222cb8e86eb1143ef78ba96c91370.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T17:19:26+00:00","modified":"2020-04-17T04:13:08+00:00","filename":"7c2222cb8e86eb1143ef78ba96c91370.jpg","authentication":"39f8c00e2ce5bd1c4bc935cbb52f01eb","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_05_fl_107_025_002_o2.jpg","size":1633191,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2984,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05067740914507},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["041330"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["041330"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["041330"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7c2222cb8e86eb1143ef78ba96c91370.jpg","FileDateTime":1509469961,"FileSize":1633191,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2984\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2984,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"16mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:10 16:41:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:10 04:13:30","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:10 04:13:30","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2696,"ExifImageLength":3252,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":189,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/189","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The association of Wisdom with a fountain brings to our minds clear ideas of its purity, beauty and usefulness.

Oh! yes, it is for that it will thus furnish this old washerwoman with water at her hand and the horses, cows and sheep in this large field may have some of it to quench their thirst.

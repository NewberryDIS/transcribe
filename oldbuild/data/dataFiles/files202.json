Heb. 1:14\nWe are sometimes led to give up a most\nprecious truth because Some grave Error\nhas been grafted upon it; or, perchance,\nit has been perverted by the unbelieving.\nWe are so careful not to be found\nholding property in common with the devil\nthat we stick to our reputation for \northodoxy at the expense of truth. Fields which\nbelong of right to God, truth and humanity\nare often abandoned without a\nstruggle when claimed by opponents or\nErrorists as a part of their creed and\nthat for fear we may be numbered\nwith them. Many Strong-holds of GOd\nhave this been given over to Satan,\nand many truths have Suffered","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":45731,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/45731","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/1b0316e235b30adc8984880ec6c2ac34.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/1b0316e235b30adc8984880ec6c2ac34.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/1b0316e235b30adc8984880ec6c2ac34.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1b0316e235b30adc8984880ec6c2ac34.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-03T17:34:52+00:00","modified":"2019-11-12T21:28:21+00:00","filename":"1b0316e235b30adc8984880ec6c2ac34.jpg","authentication":"f1d5d650099969d648808467a5925309","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_taylor_e_bx_01_fl_008_01_002_o2.jpg","size":1362083,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2854,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044190187910405},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170921"],"TimeCreated":["044952"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170921"],"TimeCreated":["044952"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170921"],"TimeCreated":["044952"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["1447"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1b0316e235b30adc8984880ec6c2ac34.jpg","FileDateTime":1509730221,"FileSize":1362083,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2854\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2854,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/9.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:09:21 16:39:43","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.076923076923077,"FNumber":9,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:09:21 04:49:52","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:09:21 04:49:52","ShutterSpeedValue":3.70044,"ApertureValue":6.33985,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2428,"ExifImageLength":3062,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":202,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/202","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Needs Review","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"because they have been so readily abandoned\nby Gods people.\nThe Puritans made a Similar mistake\non coming to this country in thinking it\nnecessary to abolish Every form of observance\nand the very folity of the Established church\nof England.

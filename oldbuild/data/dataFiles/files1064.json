Wt. Prejudice against that portion of the Cherokee claimants, who opposed the Treaty, and apartiality for those who favored it; which led to the rejection of many honest claims of the first and to the admission of many unfounded of the latter.  2d. That there were persons who had claims of the most unfounded character against the Indians, (particularly those hostile to the treaty) admitted to a large amount, while honest claimants had theirs rejected.  3d. That there were some persons, who, in an underhand manner, could get claims of any description thro', even if they had once been rejected by the Commissioners , when others almost uniformly failed, and that the former realized enormous amounts. There charges considered simply with reference to the claims imply this distinction -- good claims rejected and bad claims admitted.

These judgement books have no index, and if it were necessary to ascertain what amount any particular person had received for claims against a number of Indians, it could only be done either by taking up the account books and going through them one by one, account by account, to the number of about 8,000, or by pursuing a similarly tedious and laborious examination of the judgement books.

[The following memoranda relate to the same subject:  Cases of claims for compensation for services performed in prosecuting reservations claims before the late Cherokee Commissioners, where allowances were made by the Commissioners of Indian Affairs or the Cherokee Commissioners, without the claims being accompanied by proof of employment, or the production of power of attorney.  1. the case of G.W Rice vs Eight-Killer, a reservee, the Commissioners awarded the reservee $3,840:00   John F. Gillespy Esq. attended to the claim for Elijah Rice, Attorney for the Indian, and was allowed by the Commissioners and paid by this office $288 for his services -- being 7 1\/2% on amount awarded reservee.  On 13th March last, Hon: H.L. Turney prosecuted the claim of Elijah Rice and requested the balance due Indian to be paid to him on power of attorney.. This the Commissioner of Indian Affairs refused to do\u00a0; but it appearing from the testimony of Mr. Gillespy, that George W. Rice procured the witnesses, took the evidence and was very active with his assistance in prosecuting the claim , the Commissioner of Indian Affairs allowed the said George W. Rice 25% on the balances due reservee.  2. Case of G.W. Churchwell vs Heir of Austin Rider.  Cherokee Commissioners awarded the heirs of Rider $1,172:00  Churchwell claimed 10% for his services in prosecuting the claim and was allowed and paid that amount by Commissioner of Indian Affairs, on the testimony of Thos. W. Wilson, one of the Commissioners who certified that Churchwell argued the case, and gave it as his opinion that 20% was not a high fee. In this case Mr.C stated that he was \"directed by Caleb [Starr?], the attorney in fact, and father of Mr. Rider, to attend to the case.The heirs were 13 in number, including the widow.  3. Case of Churchwell vs Heirs Samuel Candy.  Churchwell claimed 10% on amount awarded , viz: $3.220.00 and was allowed and paid that sum on the certificate of Mr.Wilson above referred to, who certified to the fact of services rendered, but here was no evidence of employment.  There are other cases where attorneys have received compensation for prosecution of claims of some character on evidence of evidence of employment by one or more of their heirs; and have been paid for said services out the aggregate amount awarded by Commissioners.\nStatement B\nStatement of the amount stipulated in the Cherokee treaty, and of the additional ones provided by Congress towards carrying into effect, and showing particularly the dispersion made of them.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":72261,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/72261","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/23f9c05d0983dd615a4b2117f2cb81f2.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/23f9c05d0983dd615a4b2117f2cb81f2.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/23f9c05d0983dd615a4b2117f2cb81f2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/23f9c05d0983dd615a4b2117f2cb81f2.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:17:21+00:00","modified":"2020-07-27T11:25:11+00:00","filename":"23f9c05d0983dd615a4b2117f2cb81f2.jpg","authentication":"0ba5317372812d70ec48203ca1ebac89","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL13_00011_o2 copy.jpg","size":730013,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":3064,"compression_ratio":0.044121276955807},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["235143+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["235143+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["235143+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"23f9c05d0983dd615a4b2117f2cb81f2.jpg","FileDateTime":1522682196,"FileSize":730013,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"3064\"","Height":3064,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":3064,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:26:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3122},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 23:51:43","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 23:51:43","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":69,"SubSecTimeDigitized":69,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":3064,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1064,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1064","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1st.

No delay in the removal can be granted to the nation without the consent of the States interested; nor would the President desire that any delay should be conceded, other than such as may be absolutely necessary to the health and comfort of  your people.  No part of the recent appropriations are considered by the Executive as applicable to a further indemnification for the Cherokee country.  That was amply provided for by former arrangements.  The sums now granted, with the exception of one hundred thousand dollars, are intended to carry out what is supposed to have been the original intention of the Executive in the treaty of 1835, namely, to defray the expences of the removal, and of one year's subsistence of the Cherokees, at that time resident east of the Mississippi.  With respect to the appointment of Commissioners and agents other than those now employed to adjust the claims under the Treaty, the President does not think proper to remove the present Commissioners at the request of the delegation.  Such a measure would not only occassin very great delay in the adjustment of the claims, but be an act of injustice to those officers,","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":72293,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/72293","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/6e05041faeb0cc45e67d5b593aaaeea6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/6e05041faeb0cc45e67d5b593aaaeea6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/6e05041faeb0cc45e67d5b593aaaeea6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6e05041faeb0cc45e67d5b593aaaeea6.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:17:50+00:00","modified":"2020-07-22T12:48:57+00:00","filename":"6e05041faeb0cc45e67d5b593aaaeea6.jpg","authentication":"15a26f7bdab5e595741afe57a05a2994","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL13_00039_o2.jpg","size":610632,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":3059,"compression_ratio":0.036966328865642},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["235834+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["235834+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["235834+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000117"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6e05041faeb0cc45e67d5b593aaaeea6.jpg","FileDateTime":1522682197,"FileSize":610632,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"3059\"","Height":3059,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":3059,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:26:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":2524},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 23:58:34","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 23:58:34","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":87,"SubSecTimeDigitized":87,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":3059,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1064,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1064","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"officers, against whose character and conduct no evidence has been adduced; but I can assure you the government will receive and take into immediate consideration, any charges brought against their fairness & impartiality which shall be supported by proofs.

We pass by several items of discontent:  also a dissertation on the possible constructions of which the powers of the delegation were susceptible, -- and also his censures on the delegation, for requiring full powers in a Commissioner to treat.  To conclude this series of complaints, the writer represents that the delegation \"with the entire power of the nation in their hands, push on to Washington, reckless of all consequences.  They plunged,\" he says, \"into fearful uncertainty, by rushing in every face of the official declaration, that they would not be received by the President.\"  What could sustain the delegation in this fearful hour, when the writer is palsied with terror?  Conscious integrity, no doubt.  They know of no just cause, on their part, why such a declaration should be made: and they had ample means to satisfy the President, that no such cause did exist.  The writer has at length arrived at the point at which he might be expected to exhibit his credentials: to warrant his doings at New Echota.  But they are sought for in vain.  And yet, if no authority can be shown, the Treaty must be void.  He has resigned his place strikeout: at in the delegation, and procured the appointment of his brother to fill the vacancy.  The Delegation, \"with the entire power of the Nation,\" are gone to Washington; but he affirms, \"they could not and would not make a Treaty.\" And, to secure that result, a protest from New Echota, is dispatched to the President, to frustrate their efforts to strikeout: make effect an arrangement.  Well assured of the result, he affects great anxiety and disquietude.

Nor is the counterpart of this affair, more in accordance with the principles of equity and fair dealing.  The commissioners, in a letter to the Principal Chief, dated Cherokee Agency July 10th, 1835, state the views of the President, and the principles in which they were instructed to proceed in effecting, a Treaty with the Cherokees.  They say, \"we are persuaded the object of the Government in taking a census is, to enable it to deal in the most fair & just manner with the Cherokee nation.\"  And again, \"The Commissioners in their instructions are required to obtain the consent of a majority of your head-men & warriors to a Treaty, to make it valid and for this purpose, it is necessary to have an accurate census taken now.\"  But how are these instructions regarded?  The criterion furnished by the census, had it been respected, would, after all rule & all authority had been pruned down, have secured to us some approximation to fair dealing.  But, no!  The instructions of the President are discarded, and the very letter of them outraged.  At a pretended General Council, of the Chiefs, head-men & people, a Treaty is concluded under the sanction of a popular vote of seventy nine, out of a population reported by the Commissioner himself as about eighteen thousand souls.  And it has been observed that even of this final number, several were emigrants from Arkansas.

Mr John Ross the Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, is assailed in this pamphlet, and a base calumny is attempted to be palmed on his reputation, at the bar of your honorable assemblies.  The writer charges Mr Ross  with having acted unfairly towards Mr John Watts, in regard to a tract of land, once held by them in joint occupancy.  Their only title to this land was that of occupancy, under the Cherokee Nation, which by the cession of the country, of course became void; and the land in question subject to the conditions of the whole ceded territory.  The title of both Ross & Watts ceased on the cession being concluded, unless reserved by specific provision.  Under the provisions of the Treaty of 1817, a number of Cherokees enrolled for emigration to Arkansas, and agreeably to Art. 6. of said Treaty, \"to those emigrants whose improvements add real value to their lands, the United States agree to pay a full valuation for the same.\"  Under this provision, Mr John Watts enrolled for emigration and his possessions became subject to the same conditions as those of other emigrants.  That is, they were entitled to payment for their improvements, but all right & title to the land was relinquished.  In the Treaty of 1819, among other provisions, is the following;  \"Art. 2.  The United States -- agree to allow the reservation of six hundred and forty acres to every head of an Indian family residing within the ceded territory; those enrolled for Arkansas excepted.  Thus, Mr Watts, by his enrollment, under the Treaty of 1817, was precluded from the right to a reservation.

Boudinott.\"  And whereas, the said production is an emanation from a private individual, directed against another individual, and is of the nature of a private and personal dispute, which, in reason and in justice, we humbly conceive, ought not to affect deliberations involving questions vital to the rights & interests of the Cherokee people.  Therefore, we do, earnestly and respectfully, protest against the doctrines advocated in said pamphlet, as contrary to the fundamental principles of justice and subversive of our undoubted rights.  In doing which, however, we would, with submission, observe that we are not afraid of evidence\u00a0: on the contrary, we solicit inquiry, we ask investigation, we invite attention to facts, from which alone a just conclusion can be drawn.  On this point we desire no favor, we deprecate no rigour of scrutiny, we only strikeout ask a verdict according to evidence.  We have nothing to conceal.  We ardently wish all the facts in this case, in all their connections, were known to you honorable assemblies, to the high officers of your government, and to your great community.  We should then be under no apprehension for the result of this question.  We should have no doubt of receiving ample justice at your hands.  It is the influence of one sided, distorted, reports, that we deprecate:  suppressing, exaggerating and disguising facts","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":72309,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/72309","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5b7163acc21c67e00cbd31b9d8279fa8.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5b7163acc21c67e00cbd31b9d8279fa8.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5b7163acc21c67e00cbd31b9d8279fa8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5b7163acc21c67e00cbd31b9d8279fa8.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:18:05+00:00","modified":"2020-07-24T17:50:45+00:00","filename":"5b7163acc21c67e00cbd31b9d8279fa8.jpg","authentication":"9ab29f49c3c34f9b68252bb5c984a37d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL13_00058_o2.jpg","size":690530,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":3066,"compression_ratio":0.041707738397236},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["000232+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000118"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["000232+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000118"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["000232+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000118"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5b7163acc21c67e00cbd31b9d8279fa8.jpg","FileDateTime":1522682198,"FileSize":690530,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"3066\"","Height":3066,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":3066,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:27:17","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3096},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:18 00:02:32","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:18 00:02:32","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":81,"SubSecTimeDigitized":81,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":3066,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1064,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1064","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"facts strikeout to suite the purpose of sinister reporters.

And we assert, that, at this moment there is more intelligence, more intellectual and moral vigour among the Cherokees, than at any former period:  the gloomy picture, in the writer's concluding letter, to the contrary notwithstanding.  And with regard to the knowledge of our political troubles, we have, by experience, acquired a grievous familiarity with them.  And with regard to the expectations with which we are said to be deluded, we do not, perhaps, comprehend the precise import of the charge.  But we know of no expectations held out by Mr Ross, further than we have all indulged, and which we cannot yet forego: namely, that The United States will do justice.  And we certainly are not prepared to admit such a sentiment to be incompatible with, or injurious to, our interests.

Therefore, during the sitting of the General Council at Red Clay, in October 1835, in order to put an end to these evils, and to secure unity of sentiment & action, in a great effort to obtain a final settlement of our difficulties, a number of individuals on each side were selected, to confer on the existing dissentions and, if possible, to effect a reconciliation.

The design of this conference, and the compromise in question, was not to establish or legalize a Ridge party nor a Ross party, nor to refrain the action or powers of the Council; but to reconcile certain differences existing among individuals; so as to unite the wisdom and the energies of the Nation.  This object being secured, the acts of this Popular National Council, were as much the acts of the complainant and his friends, as of any other individuals: and among those acts, was the appointment of the additional delegates.  When this compromise strikeout: had been was effected, sixteen delegated had already been appointed.  It was then agreed to add three, of the Ridge party.  The people of Valley Towns, then, signified their desire that their section of the country should be more adequately represented, and wished one delegate of their choice to be added.  This was also proposed to the Council and approved.  In all this, no infringement of the rights of the complainant and his friends was ever dreamed of:  In agreeing to represent the interests of their party, it would seem illiberal & unjust, on that account, to preclude the representation of any other special interest also.  The people of Valley Towns had certainly a reasonable claim on the Council:  their territory embracing two of the eight districts of the nation, and their population five or six thousand souls.

Having strikeout: conclu dispatched the physical and tangible charges, the writer proceeds to that of a more strikeout: intangible recondite character.  Here he unfolds flagrant violations of the spirit of compromise.  He complains that his party and sentiments were not treated with sufficient respect, in the concluding speeches at Red Clay Council.  The speaker addressed them, as \"his children, who had strayed from the right path; but had now returned to their duty.\"  To this, we can only say, that these speeches are voluntary effusions, which, however, often indicate the leaning of the public mind.

Autograph manuscript Relating to entitled \"Publications Justifying the Decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the Missionary Case\" (Cherokee Indians).  33 pp.  4to handwritten note: back of this Mss is:   \"Publications justifying the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the Missionary Case.\"  In the official paper published at Washington, the Globe, of Saturday, March 31. 1832, there is an essay of twelve columns headed \"An examination of the Cherokee question\", which seems intended as a review of the late decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the missionary cause. The Editor invites the attention of the country to this article by the assurance that \"it is from the pen of one eminently qualified, by his intimacy with all that concerns in Indian relations, and by his legal and literary attainments, to do justice to the subject.\" Common rumor has, without contradiction, attributed the article to a member of the present cabinet, and to that member who stands charged with the department to which is confided the administration of our Indian affairs.

Every individual in the community has the right to express and publish his opinions, in such language, on the soundness of an opinion of that or any other tribunal.

The paper acquires still more awful consequence, by comparing it with the other parts of the President's conduct in relation to this same Indian controversy.  The President of the United States has already refused to extend to the Cherokee Nation that guaranty of their lands and that protection to their persons which have been stipulated by a succession of treaties, regularly made with them by preceding Presidents, and solemnly ratified by the Senate of the United States; the only reason or apology offered for such refusal being that assigned by his official organ (the late Secretary of War) that those treaties are not binding on the United States.  President Washington, on the contrary, considered them as binding, and declared in a public message to the Senate that he would employ the power vested in him by the Constitution of the United States to protect the Indians in the rights secured to them by those treaties.  All his successors, down to the year 1829, have done the same thing; and two of them have, on several occasions, actually employed the military force of the United States in repelling the the pretentions of Georgia, and giving full and faithful effect to those treaties.

Thus every branch of our government, ever since the adoption of the Constitution, has uniformly, continually, unanimously concurred in asserting, by the most solemn acts, the validity and obligation of these treaties.

But President Jackson openly refuses to execute it, assigning as his only reason, through his aforesaid organ, that the law is unconstitutional.  Thus although sworn to execute the laws of the union, he assumes to himself the arbitrary power of deciding, at his pleasure, what laws, and what treaties, made by his predecessors and sanctioned by the whole nation, he will execute; and he annuls both treaties and law, with as much indifference and non-chalance, as if we had no Constitution, or as if all power were confided by that instrument to him,  Having paid these ceremonious visits of nullification to the other departments of the government, he comes now to the Judiciary; and he has only to extinguish this last light of the Constitution, to usher in the night of despotism, and taking all the powers, legislative, executive and judicial, into his own hands, to give us a taste of Russian autocracy in an American dress.  In evidence of what he has already done, we appeal to the outrages which he has suffered to be committed by the State of Georgia on the Cherokee Nation, in open violation of the treaties and laws of the United States, and to the explanatory","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":72330,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/72330","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/06d5fc070fef572d7387e4f2f79c712c.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/06d5fc070fef572d7387e4f2f79c712c.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/06d5fc070fef572d7387e4f2f79c712c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/06d5fc070fef572d7387e4f2f79c712c.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:18:23+00:00","modified":"2020-07-14T17:23:39+00:00","filename":"06d5fc070fef572d7387e4f2f79c712c.jpg","authentication":"523e779365600e928ae96b8c087b79bd","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL14_00008_o2 copy.jpg","size":707251,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2374,"compression_ratio":0.055169506068832},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["001327+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000118"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["001327+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000118"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["001327+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000118"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"06d5fc070fef572d7387e4f2f79c712c.jpg","FileDateTime":1522682198,"FileSize":707251,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2374\"","Height":2374,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2374,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:27:35","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5209},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:18 00:13:27","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:18 00:13:27","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":49,"SubSecTimeDigitized":49,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2374,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1064,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1064","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"explanatory correspondence of his Secretary, Mr Eaton, addressed to the Governor of Georgia, the the Agent of the Cherokee Nation, and to the Delegates of that Nation at Washington.  As to his future intentions with regard to the Judiciary, there is but too much reason to fear that the paper before us contains the true indications we shall be but too happy to find ourselves disappointed in this respect.  But we are unable to understand what necessity, what decency, or propriety there can be in an attack by the Executive on a co-ordinate branch of the government, tending to bring them into disrepute & contempt, unless it is to be followed by some sort of action.  A President or his ministers would not indulge in such a speculation, one would think, for the mere purpose of idle speculation.  It would be but a sorry employment for a President to seek to degrade this venerable tribunal, in the mere spirit of wanton mischief.  We cannot suppose any President capable of it.  The paper we fear has a deeper and more deadly aim: to forestall the public opinion and enlist it in support of he predetermined purpose to treat the sentence of the Supreme Court with the same unceremonious contempt, which he has already shown to the treaties & laws of the United States.  We have no pleasure in making these remarks:  but these are facts which are before the nation, and since the appeal has been made to the Country, it is proper that the Country should see the whole ground before they decide.  It seems to be the settled purpose of the President to bear out the State of Georgia triumphant in this controversy; and to beat down every obstacle which opposes his march.  Treaties, laws, and judicial  decisions are all to be trodden into the dust, and the State of Georgia is to conduct her triumphal procession over their ruin.  We regard the paper before us as a part of the same system on which the President has heretofore acted in annulling the treaties & laws, and we deem it due to the correct understanding of the subject by the Country, that they should have his entire views and course of action before them ere the come to their conclusion on this part of his operations, the proposed nullification of the sentence of the Supreme Court.  We entertain no doubt of maintaining the entire Country, in the decision of the Supreme Court.

It is this.  Is it competent to a President of the United States to question the rectitude of a decision of the Supreme Court? -- It is the settled axiom of republican governments that the three great departments of political power, the legislative, the executive, and the judicial, shall be kept separate and distinct, and be wielded by different hands, each being separately responsible for its conduct, in its own peculiar sphere.  It has been universally deemed essential to the liberty and safety of the people that this division of power should be strictly maintained.  The very definition of a despotism is the union of all these powers in the same hand.  Hence it has been the labour of the Constitution of the United States to keep them apart.  Thus the first article of that  instrument declares that \"all legislative powers herein granted, shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate & house of Representatives\": The second article, that \"the Executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States,\" and it is thereby made his duty to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed\":  the third article that \"the judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such inferior courts as Congress shall, from time to time, ordain & establish\"; and the decision of the Supreme Court is made final.  Now the legislative power is employed in making and repealing laws; and the repealing process is as exclusively a legislative act as was the first creation of the law projected to be repealed.  So the judicial power is employed in making in the inferior tribunals, and affirming or reversing them in the Supreme Court, and the reversal or affirmation is as exclusively a judicial act as the passing the first sentence.  Let us not be told then that the President has never claimed the power of making a law; if he has repealed one, he has greatly usurped the legislative power.  Let us not be told that he has never passed a judicial sentence; if he has reversed one, he has been equally guilty of usurping judicial power.  And has he not repealed a law of Congress, in refusing to carry into effect the Indian intercourse act of 1802, on the alleged ground of its unconstitutionality?  Of what consequence is it that he has not, in terms, repealed that law, and that he has not expunged it from the statute book?  Has he not declared that it is no law, and treated it as a dead letter, a mere nullity?

If he reverses a sentence of the Supreme Court it is equally a usurpation of judicial power.  And will he not have reversed such a sentence, if he officially declares erroneous and void and refuses to execute it?  Will not this be a practical reversal far more efficacious than a verbal one, and a direct invasion of the Constitutional Power of the Judiciary?  These principles are so obvious that they require no amplitude of illustration.  Will it be asked whether a President of the United States is bound to execute a law which he deems unconstitutional , or a sentence of the Supreme Court which he deems erroneous?  The answer is found in the Constitution itself.  The power of making the law is confided to Congress; the power of expounding and declaring it, in the last resort, to the Supreme Court.  Each of these bodies is responsible in its separate department, for the faithful execution of the powers confided to it.  The President has no responsibility for them, nor they for him.  His separate and exclusive duty is not to make nor to expound, but solely to execute the law, as it has been made by one of these bodies, and expounded & declared by the other;  and it is for the execution of the laws alone that he is responsible.  His complete justification for executing the law is found in the law itself as made by Congress and expounded by the Supreme Court.  There is no possible motive, therefore, for clothing him with a superintending and reversing power over acts of Congress which have been passed, in sentences by the Supreme Court which have been pronounced; while to concede such a power to him is to break up the whole demarcation so studiously introduced by the Constitution, to place the legislative and judicial departments  under his entire controul, and to convert the Constitution into an absolute despotism, with all the powers of government virtually and practically concentrated in one hand..  If it is to rest in his arbitrary pleasure what laws he will execute, and what sentences of the Supreme Court he will carry into effect, we see no difference between a President of the United States and the most absolute monarch that exists either in Europe or Asia.

The adherents of Executive power may affect to Smile at this as extravagant and unfounded prophecy: but we will ask any cool and unprejudiced man in the community, if it be not the natural, the unavoidable consequence of yielding to the President the undisputed power of annulling, by his single fiat, the past treaties, laws, and adjudications of the United States?  What is to impede him in this career?  What is to stop or bind him? Treaties do not bind him, he discards them at pleasure.  Acts of Congress do not bind him; he declares them unconstitutional.  Judgments of the Supreme Court do not bind him; he pronounces them erroneous and disregards them.  What is there that can arrest him, or avert the catastrophe to which we have pointed?  There exists but one in theory; and with the extensive and desolating patronage wielded by the President, and the state of political immorality to which we have already advanced, it would be but mockery to refer us to that.  It is manifest that if the course that already has been pursued is to be further tolerated, we have no Constitution.  If the laws of Congress to be openly disregarded and set at naught, we have, virtually no legislature.  If the decisions of the Supreme Court are to be annulled, we have no judiciary; for what is the difference between no Congress and a Congress whose acts are treated as nullities, or the difference between no judiciary and one whose decisions may be abolished at the pleasure of the Executive!  There have been other recent indications of a startling nature.  Straws, they say, will show which way the wind sits.  Can the public have forgotten that very lately, when the Senate exercised its constitutional power of rejecting a nomination made by the President, the same official paper, the Globe, had the hardihood publicly to express its disapprobation of this power of the Senate, and to intimate the desire that it would be abolished.  That paper is considered as the mere echo of the sentiments and wishes of the Executive.  And what are we to auger from this impatience of all the salutary restraints of the Constitution?  What are we to auger from it, more especially, when connected with the lofty and impervious spirit, so openly and fearlessly exhibited in the Executive acts to which we have referred.

The gigantic strides which have already been taken, in perfect consonance with the past habits of the President, to pass uncensored and to be followed up, by farther strides in the same direction, it will be exceedingly weak and ridiculous in them to complain, if, in the course of a few years, they see an armed force stationed in Washington, to overawe the proceedings of their Senate & House of Representatives, and the peaceful and happy provisions of their Constitution suspended by the introduction of martial law.  It is in this train and this connexion with the pact, that we regard, with serious alarm, the ministerial document which has been placed before the public.  It has already seized upon, and blazoned by the government papers, as a splendid production; as refuting the opinion of the Supreme Court, with the certainty of demonstration; and, under its inspiring influence, the Richmond Enquirer has not hesitated to stigmatize that opinion as a gross absurdity.  The instance, though of no other consequence, seems to shew the purpose to which the Executive paper is to be directed, and the use intended to be made of it.  It is to degrade the Supreme Court, and to prepare the way for the nullification of its sentences, wherever they shall thwart the Executive will.  Are the people of the United States prepared for this result?  If they be, farewell to the Constitution of the United States.

But waving this objection, and regarding the paper in the light of an appeal to the people of the United States from the decision of the Supreme Court, let us see whether this Executive battery has shaken, in the slightest degree, any part of the Court's opinion.  Our first remark upon it, is, that considered as an answer to the argument of the Court, the argument of the Court, and the case in which it was pronounced, ought to have been candidly exhibited by the writer, in order that the reader might have had before him, at the same time, the story strikeout: on of both sides of the question.  The case, however, is not stated.  Nor are the connected propositions which led the Court to their conclusion exhibited, but the writer has contented himself with quoting a few detached sentences from the Court's opinion and directing the whole power of his twelve columns upon them.  This we consider as unfair towards the Court, and unfair towards the country, to whom this appeal is thus carried, if the design be to make the country to judge with full intelligence on the subject.  The writer may allege that the opinion of the Court had been already published.  Had it been published in the Globe?  But even if it had, , we should have supposed that a writer conscious of the depth of his cause, would not have been satisfied with a post publication, which his readers might or might not have seen, but would have drawn up the arguments, side by side, --would have noted that of the Supreme Court in all its strength, and would have met it, fully and fairly, by his victorious reply.  This course, however, he has not pursued; and if his reader is to judge of the Court's opinion by that meagre exhibition, which this writer has thought proper to make of it, he might well conclude that it was the poorest and most driveling nonsense that ever fell from any bench, instead of being, as all enlightened and impartial men have","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":72336,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/72336","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/92f2a4713062e59e1ebb2af6c7d12443.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/92f2a4713062e59e1ebb2af6c7d12443.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/92f2a4713062e59e1ebb2af6c7d12443.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/92f2a4713062e59e1ebb2af6c7d12443.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:18:28+00:00","modified":"2020-07-19T17:40:22+00:00","filename":"92f2a4713062e59e1ebb2af6c7d12443.jpg","authentication":"f6c7d471d750baac5602c0d3f87f3be3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL14_00011_o2 copy.jpg","size":699057,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2382,"compression_ratio":0.054347187237615},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["001410+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000118"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["001410+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000118"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["001410+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000118"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"92f2a4713062e59e1ebb2af6c7d12443.jpg","FileDateTime":1522682199,"FileSize":699057,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2382\"","Height":2382,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2382,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:27:38","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5499},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:18 00:14:10","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:18 00:14:10","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":69,"SubSecTimeDigitized":69,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2382,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1064,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1064","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"have pronounced it, one of the most comprehensive, luminous, and conclusive demonstrations that ever proceeded from the mind of the Chief Justice of the United States.  Nothing can be more unfair than this mode of detaching an isolated sentence from from a great argument, without giving its connexion with the context, with the antecedant and subsequent matter which illustrates, explains, and confirms it, and directing the assault upon the sentence thus detached.  No argument, however great & demonstrative, can bear this foul process of dismemberment.  If we would form a just and candid opinion of it, the whole must be taken together and the conclusion compared with the entire process of reasoning which led to it.  Let us endeavour briefly to supply these omissions, before we proceed to an analysis of the Executive argument.  By the treaties subsisting between the Cherokee nation and the United States, citizens of the United States were authorized to enter that territory with the permission of the President of the United States.  By several of these treaties the most earnest desire had been expressed to promote the civilization of that tribe, and to enable them to form a government and make a body of laws for themselves.   By a treaty of the 17th February 1819, a school fund is formed, out of Cherokee cessions of lands, to be administered under the direction of the President of the United States.  On the 3rd of March following Congress passed an act making provision for the civilisation of the Indian tribes, adjoining the frontier settlements, by which the President was authorized in every case when he shall judge improvement in the habits and conditions of such Indians practicable, and that the means of instruction can be introduced with their own consent, the employ capable persons of good moral character to instruct them in the mode of agriculture suited to their situation, and strikeout: to for teaching their children in reading, writing & arithmetric, and for performing such other duties, sa may be enjoined, according to the President's instructions.

In their defence, they filed separate special pleas, setting forth the facts above mentioned, and in those pleas they rely on various treaties subsisting between the Cherokee nation and the United States, on the Constitution of the United States, and on the Intercourse Act of 1802, to all of which they insist that the law of Georgia is repugnant, and, therefore, unconstitutional and void.  The State Court of Georgia over-ruled these pleas, and sentenced them, severally, to four years' imprisonment in the penitentiary of Georgia, where these pious and virtuous men are not suffering the execution of this disgraceful sentence, among the common convicts of the State.  The 25th Section of the Judiciary act, gives a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States from the final sentence of a State Court, in all cases where the validity of a State law has been drawn in question on the ground of repugnance to a treaty, law, or the Constitution of the United States.  The validity of a State law was drawn into question, on all these grounds in the case of Messr Worcester & Butter, and the only question before the Supreme Court was whether the alleged repugnance existed.  The Court, in a most able opinion, decide that the law of Georgia is repugnant to the Constitution, treaties and laws of the United States, and that the Sentence which had been pronounced under the authority of the State law, ought, therefore, to be reversed and annulled.  Proceeding to render such judgment as the State Court ought to have rendered, they further adjudge that the special plea filed by the defendants is a good and sufficient plea in bar to the indictment, that all proceedings on the indictment do thenceforth surcease, and that the defendants be dismissed therefrom, and go thereof quit, without day.

This mandate was in due form presented to the State Court of Georgia, but so far from obeying, they refused to pay the slightest attention to it, -- refused even to enter upon their minutes the motion made for the discharge of the prisoners, or to recognise in any form the existence of the mandate, but treated it as a mere nullity.  All these facts were known at Washington, when this executive manifesto was issued denouncing before the Nation the opinion of the Supreme Court, and thus sustaining and encouraging the State Court of Georgia in their contumacious resistance to the mandate of the Court.  This paper, too, let it strikeout never be forgotten, proceeds from a cabinet minister of the President of the United States, whose constitutional duty it is \"to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\"  The reader will observe that the true and only question before the Supreme Court was, whether the law of Georgia under which Messr Worcester & Butter had been arrested within the Cherokee territory, and sentenced to the Penitentiary of Georgia, was or was not repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, and laws of the United States.  The Supreme Court saw that the Constitution of the United States had conferred upon the President & Senate the exclusive power of making treaties, and regulating commerce with the Indian tribes.

We shall not deny to him the praise of address in keeping, as long as he can, far away from the true ground of the controversy, a comparison of the law of Georgia, with the Constitution, laws and treaties of the United States.  More than one half of his essay is employed in the consideration of elementary principles as applied to the relative conditions of civilized and savage man.  Through the first six columns and part of the seventh, he labours these principles with all the learning and dexterity which he can summon to his aid, and, with a great show of candor & humanity, conducts himself to the conclusion that civilized communities have a right to take possession of a country inhabited by uncivilized tribes, to assume jurisdiction over them, to appropriate to themselves such portion of the territory as they think proper, and that in the exercise of this right, such communities are the exclusive judges of the extent of jurisdiction to be assumed and of territory to be appropriated: that is to say, they are the exclusive judges in their own cause.  Now if we were to concede to the author the justness of these conclusions (which we are very far from intending) the question would still remain whether these rights, thus alleged to belong to the civilized invader, may not be waived by him upon the universally acknowledged principle that any one may renounce a privilege or right introduced for his own benefit; and whether if, in the state of weakness in which he entered the country, he has actually waived it by solemn treaty with the more powerful aborigines, for the sake of peace & quiet, he can afterwards resume it, in violation of such treaty, whenever his cupidity, backed by increased power, shall prompt the measure.  How do common sense and common justice to which this writer so frequently appeals, answer this question?  But the case is still stronger.  The ground on which this right of the civilized invader is placed, is, that he is an agriculturist, and may gain a rightful occupancy in the soil by tilling the earth, whereas the savage aborigines are yet in the hunter state, living by war, & the pursuit of game, and can therefore gain no right of occupancy","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":72341,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/72341","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/8839f437e217640d4286b860a08d0ed4.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/8839f437e217640d4286b860a08d0ed4.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/8839f437e217640d4286b860a08d0ed4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8839f437e217640d4286b860a08d0ed4.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:18:31+00:00","modified":"2020-07-23T12:48:59+00:00","filename":"8839f437e217640d4286b860a08d0ed4.jpg","authentication":"d7352ffb50f69cf0407dc12d04db6a06","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL14_00013_o2.jpg","size":645965,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2360,"compression_ratio":0.050687774639046},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["001444+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000118"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["001444+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000118"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["001444+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000118"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8839f437e217640d4286b860a08d0ed4.jpg","FileDateTime":1522682199,"FileSize":645965,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2360\"","Height":2360,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2360,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:27:40","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4840},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:18 00:14:44","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:18 00:14:44","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":67,"SubSecTimeDigitized":67,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2360,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1064,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1064","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"occupancy in the boundless forests in which they roam.

Finally, he comes to the treaties, and at this staggering point, the argument which had manifestly faltered at the Constitution, becomes dark and unintelligible to us, though, no doubt, extremely luminous and satisfactory to the State of Georgia and to the President of the United States.  From a chaos of ideas, in which we have found it extremely difficult to keep even a dim sight of the writer, he emerges at length, to the conclusions, first, that if these treaties are incompatible with the right of Georgia to govern the Cherokees, the treaties themselves are unconstitutional; but, secondly, that these treaties may be maintained  with perfect good faith, and yet leave to the State of Georgia all the rights which she asserted over the Cherokees; than which we will venture to affirm that a more intrepid proposition was never attempted to be maintained by Gorgias of Leontium, or any other of his tribe, in any age of the world.

For we insist that the Cherokee lands are not within the boundaries of the State of Georgia, to any purpose of jurisdiction whatever, so long as the Cherokees choose to retain the possession of those lands.  The writer, therefore, by his mode of stating the question, assumes the very point in dispute.  If he means only that these lands lie, partly, within what are called the chartered limits of Georgia, although this question has been strenuously contested by others, we are willing to concede it for the purpose of the argument.  Having thus stated the question, he proceeds to his first and great ground, the original right of the civilized communities of Europe to take this country from the possession of the Aboriginal hunter, and to impose their own government on these wild lords of the forest.  It is on this point that the author expatiates and luxuriates, through his first six columns and a half, with an air of confidence which would have surprised us, had we not so often seen how easily men can reconcile their faith with their wishes, in embracing with zeal, the most preposterous paradoxes.

This view of the subject, however, though it is manifestly the true view, is no where brought out in  full light in the whole of this long essay, but is kept industriously out of sight, and the author takes for his great rock of refuge, the primitive right of discovery, as if this right had never been modified, but the Europeans had just stepped upon this continent and the question were now before us in all its freshness and integrity.  But let us indulge him in his career & see what he makes of it.  The author insists on the right of the civilized communities of Europe to disregard the title of these nomadic tribes, as he learnedly calls them, to restrain them within narrow limits, which he explains in his conclusion, to mean to take to themselves just so much of the country as they pleased; and, consequently, to take the whole, if they pleased; because these civilized communities were cultivators of the earth, and these nomadic tribes were hunters and warriors.  Nomadic, in its etymology, means pastoral, and nomadic tribes are tribes of shepherds, who, in the second stage of human society, wander with their flocks wherever pasturage can be found.  It is not for the purpose of verbal criticism that we make this remark, but for the purpose of shewing that the author's argument applies as well to the expulsion or subjugation of shepherds as hunters:  the paramount right which he asserts being found on the actual cultivation of the earth as an employment, which cultivation is no more the employment of men in the shepherd than in the hunter State.

The order was issued to our first parents, when they were the only human beings on the earth, and there were, consequently, no other human beings to be subdued, and the order is in the present tense relating necessarily to immediate action, \"subdue the earth and have dominion, &c.\"  Or does the Author consider the order to subdue the earth as an order to cultivate it?  But that cannot be the sense; because the order was issued to our first Parents when they were in a state of innocence and God was in the act of blessing them: whereas the order to \"till the earth: was not issued until after the fall, and it was then issued as a curse and a punishment for their offence.  It was on account of his past sin, and to prevent any farther aggravation of it, that man was expelled from Paradise.  \"Therefore, the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken\". (Gen: 3.23.)  Such is the origin of the boasted claims of agriculture.  In there any thing in the sacred volume which marks a preference of this employment to any other?  The first children were Cain and Abel: \"And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\"  The curse, therefore, falls directly on Cain.  Which was the favorite of the Almighty?  Whose offering was accepted?  \"And the Lord had respect to Abel and his offering:  But unto Cain and his offering He had  not respect.\"  The shepherd it seems was preferred to the agriculturist; and in a fit of jealousy & envy, Cain rose up against his brother and slew him; just as some European agriculturists, pursuing the example of this proto-type, have risen up against their nomadic brethren of America & slain them.  The fratricide seems not to have been approved by the Almighty, for he says to Cain \"and now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; when thou tillest the ground it shall not yield unto thee her strength: a fugitive & a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.\" (Gen. 4, 11&12.)

He was & is the great shepherd of his people.  Thus, so far as the sacred volume speaks, the marked preference is not for the agricultural, but for the nomadic tribes.  Will this writer object that the aborigines of America were not shepherds but hunters?  The answer has been anticipated.  If the argument be false as to shepherds, it is equally false as to hunters: for it is to tillers of the earth, that he assigns the right of expulsion and subjugation, over all who are not tillers of the earth, but wanders, at large, over its surface, depending on its spontaneous production, and not incorporating their labor with the soil; a description just as applicable to shepherds as to hunters.  It is not, therefore, in that part of this divine command which directed our first parents to subdue the earth, that this author can find a warrant from Heaven for the arbitrary power which he asserts for agriculturalists over the nomadic tribes.  Is there any such warrant in the other part of the command which orders them to \"increase & multiply to replenish the earth?\"  This order was not given to agriculturalists, for Adam and Eve were not agriculturalists, nor was it intended that they should be so, while they retained their innocence.  The order was not issued to them, therefore, with any reference to agricultural character or pursuits, as the means of obeying the command.  Nor can it be pretended that the order was restricted to tillers of the earth.  It was to the nomadic Abraham the promise was made that his posterity should be as the stars of Heaven.

They may have been, for aught we know, descendants from the agriculturalist Cain, against whom, we have seen, it was denounced that he should be a fugitive and vagabond in the earth.  But if they were, there was no authority to destroy them, for it is written, \"whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken upon him, sevenfold.:  or they may have been, as they have been conjectured to have been, descendants from the lost tribes of Israel.  But whoever they were, and however they may have found their way to to this continent, here they were, heaven directed, in this land, the gift of the Great Spirit, members of the human family, and having the same common origin with ourselves; and here they were, obeying in their turn, the same divine command, to increase and multiply and replenish the earth.

The ground first taken is that the occupancy of wandering tribes, who do not mix their labor with the soil, gives them no vested interest in it, and the agriculturalists have a right to invade the country as vacant, and to possess themselves of it, by force.  The right of discovery, on the contrary, puts the European claim on the ground that they were Christians, and the aborigines of this country infidels, whom Christians had a right to subdue or extirpate like wild beasts, in the name and by the title of the Redeemer, to whom the dominion of the earth belonged.  This pretended right grew out of the wild doctrine of the Crusades, which no Christian writer in modern times has undertaken to defend, but which all enlightened men now and long since have concurred in representing as a dr5eam of fanaticism, engendered by superstition, or the warlike spirit of the age.  This right of discovery is one which no man of any intellectual standing has even attempted in this age of light, to maintain against the aborigines of this country, on the ground of natural justice or reason.  That these people, who had themselves discovered & possessed this country, from a period beyond the reach of history or even of tradition, should suddenly have their right to it, by the mere circumstance that a subject of Henry the VII of England had sailed along the coast and looked at it from the deck of his ship, is a position so absurd and monstrous, that it requires but to be stated to be rejected by any sound understanding.  The right of first discovery was one which the potentates of Europe adopted among themselves for the peaceable settlement of their own respective pretentions on this continent: but it is one which has no natural and just bearing on the claims of the Indians.

That the discoverers acquired at once the ultimate domain to the lands, and the immediate right, exclusive of all other European powers, to extinguish the Indian title.  2. That the Indian title to the present possession and use of the land remained in them, until it should be extinguished by treaty, or conquest, and, consequently, that mere discovery was not, of itself, any such conquest of extinguishment.  3.  That though the Indian sovereignty was to some extent impaired by the discovery, yet that the general right of self government still remained in them, on the territory admitted to be theirs, so long as they thought proper to retain it.  And finally that the Indian title could only be extinguished by and for the use of the Sovereign, to whom the right of discovery belonged:  And, consequently, could not be purchased by individuals for their own use; which last point was the single point in the case of Johnson & McIntosh, and, consequently, decided the case against the purchasers.

But the Supreme Court did not leave it open; on the contrary, so far as the present controversy is concerned, it was completely closed by the principles established in that hitherto uncontroverted case.  They say (page 573-4) \"Those relations which were to exist between the discoverers & the natives, were to be regulated by themselves.  The rights thus acquired being exclusive, no other power could interpose.\"  \"In the establishment of these relations, the rights of the original inhabitants were, in no instance, disregarded, but were, necessarily, to a considerable extent impaired.  They were admitted to be the rightful occupants of the soil, with a l nations, were necessarily diminished, and the power legal as well as just claim to retain the possession of it, and to use it according to their own discretion: but their rights to complete sovreignty as independent nations, were necessarily diminished, and the power to dispose of the soil at their own will to whomsoever they pleased, was denied by the original fundamental principle, that discovery gave exclusive title to those who made it.  In a subsequent page of the same case, (593) the court says-- \"The title of the crown could be acquired only by a conveyance from the crown.  If an individual might extinguish the Indian title for his own benefit, or, in other words, might purchase it, still he could acquire only that title.  Admitting their power to change their laws or usages so far as to allow an individual to separate a portion of their lands from the common stick, and hold it in severalty, still it is part of their territory and is held under them, by a title dependent on their laws.  The grant derives its efficacy from their will; and if they choose to resume it, and make a different disposition of the land, the courts of the United States cannot interpose for the protection of the title.  The person who purchased land from the Indians, within their territory, incorporates himself with them, so far as respects the property purchased, holds their title under their protection and subject to their laws.  If they annul the grant, we know of no tribunal which can revise & set aside the proceeding.

We answer, most materially.  They could not alienate their lands, however much they might desire it, strikeout either to individuals or to any other Sovereign that to the discoverer; thus a monopoly was created in his favour, and, consequently, all the benefits of competition were lost to the Indians.

Let us see what the historian Robertson says of this same papal bull.  The king & queen of Spain having fitted out a second expedition for Columbus, the historian says, \"But formidable and well provided as this fleet was, Ferdinand and Isabella did not rest their title to the profusion of the newly discovered countries upon it's operation alone.  The example of the Portuguese, as well as a the superstition of the age, made it necessary to obtain from the Roman pontiff a grant of those territories which they wished to occupy.  The pope, as the vicar and representative of Jesus Christ, was supposed to have a right of dominion over all of the kingdoms of the earth.  Alexander VI, a pontiff infamous for every crime which disgraces humanity, filled the papal throne at that time.  As he was born Ferdinand's subject, and very solicitous to procure the protection of Spain, in order to facilitate the execution of his ambitious schemes in favour of his own family, he was extremely willing to gratify the Spanish monarch.  By an act of liberality which cost him nothing, and that strikeout: seemed served to establish the jurisdiction & pretensions of the Papal see, he granted in full right to Ferdinand & Isabella all the countries which they had discovered or should discover, and in virtue of that power which he derived from Jesus Christ, he conferred on the crown of Castille vast regions, to the possession of which he was so far from having any title, that he was unacquainted with their situation, and ignorant, even, of their existence.  As it was necessary to prevent this grant from interfering with that formerly made to the crown of Portugal, he appointed that a line, supposed to be drawn from pole to pole, a hundred leagues to the west of the Azores, should serve as a limit between them; and, in the plenitude of his power, bestowed all to the east of this imaginary line upon the Portuguese, and strikeout: to all to the west of it, upon the Spaniards.\"  Such is the pure and respectable fountain from which this author deduces","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":72357,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/72357","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/9c4a018266a3d330e933d4e2760bf950.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/9c4a018266a3d330e933d4e2760bf950.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/9c4a018266a3d330e933d4e2760bf950.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/9c4a018266a3d330e933d4e2760bf950.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T15:18:43+00:00","modified":"2020-04-27T15:12:43+00:00","filename":"9c4a018266a3d330e933d4e2760bf950.jpg","authentication":"1ce93c67229282d55a903e0137af7f7a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL14_00021_o2.jpg","size":661295,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2338,"compression_ratio":0.052378972214302},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["001740+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000118"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["001740+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000118"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000118"],"TimeCreated":["001740+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000118"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"9c4a018266a3d330e933d4e2760bf950.jpg","FileDateTime":1522682199,"FileSize":661295,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2338\"","Height":2338,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2338,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:27:48","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6047},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:18 00:17:40","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:18 00:17:40","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":11,"SubSecTimeDigitized":11,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2338,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1064,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1064","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"deduces the origin of the European right. If his object had been to ridicule and degrade it, he could not have made a happier selection of an authority. but if their papal bill be of any authority, this country, lying more than a hundred leagues to the west of the [Azores?], still belongs to Spain; for she has never ceded it to any other sovereign.

The general doctrine was this: The discoverer of a country not previously known to any of the civilized nations of the old world, had a right to take possession, and to establish some token of sovereignty. He then became the rightful owner of all the land within a certain distance of this point.\"- But this is not the doctrine of the papal bill.It does not give this right to every discoverer, nor does it acknowledge the right to arise from the discovery.  The Pope would never have acknowledged such a right of discovery in any heretic. Even with regard to his catholic vassals, who acknowledged his supremacy, it was not the discovery which constituted the title; it was the grant of the Pope which had this effect. If the mere discovery per se conferred the title, there was no necessity to apply to the Pope for his grant. And id the doctrine advanced in that bill, be, as we are told it is, the doctrine which has been maintained to the present day, it will be necessary for the state of Georgia to sustain her claims by unclear a title derived under this bill, or some other from the same source. The truth is that the writer seems not to have perfectly clarified and arranged his own ideas on this subject.

Extract from Robert Proud's history of Pennsylvania, vol:1st, page -194,195,196.  1681- \"In one of these ships sailed William Markham, a relation of the proprietary; whom he had appointed his deputy governor, and joined with him certain commissioners, to confer with the Indians, or aborigines, of the country, respecting their lands; and to confirm them with a league of peace. These commissioners he enjoined to treat them with all possible candour, justice and humanity.  to cultivate a right understanding with these natives, by a kind, gentle and just treatment and usage, was an affair of great importance to the future happiness and prosperity of the province; which good policy alone, even from views of temporal interest, in such a case, would point out; yet notwithstanding this the unhappy effects of a contrary conduct, on a neglect in this particular, had been frequently and long experienced, in some other provinces, to their great detriment and ruinous consequences.  But William Penn appears to have acted from higher, and more disinterested motives, in reference to these people, than from those of mere temporal advantage only; which, it is manifest, he never received from the province, in any respect whatever, during a life of near thirty-seven years' continuance after this time; but lost much by it. His ideas were more exalted, than to be confined within the narrow view of a temporary interest alone, and his conduct respecting these poor, ignorant and savage people, declared his regard for universal justice, and the natural rights of mankind; tending to impress in their minds, as was his concern for all others, a proper sense of eternal justice, and the happy effects of friendship, love and peace; than which nothing can have a stranger influence on the rational and considerate mind, to keep it within the due bounds of justice and truth.

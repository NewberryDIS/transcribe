Our four teachers and Mr. James accompanied us to it. when we waited for the Packet Musician till 12 oc (about three hours) when we bade adieu to our teachers and Mr. James and went on board expecting to remain for four days at least - until we should reach Buffalo. Slept but very little - the novelty of the occasion and the noise prevented. \n\nJune 2d Had a very pleasant day - thought I should love to have parents & brothers look in upon our company of 34, (including the sister of one of our band of teachers) all comfortably situated - some sewing - some reading - some writing some in the cabin and some on deck enjoying the delightful Schoharie scenery, acquaduct over Schoharie Creek. Wrote a letter home and dropped it at one of the way places. \nJune 3 passed through Utica - went on shore and into a book store. Begin to feel quite contented in my home on the boat. Enjoy the days very much and nights not so pleasant. The cabin is complete and has a piano. The captain's name is Blakeley - his wife and four children are on board - a very pleasant family indeed - eldest daughter plays the piano - & son the violin. Went on deck too? and at? night - saw toy? houses in profusion scattered along the banks of the Canal - probably Dutch settlements. \nJune 4th. Passed through Syracuse - beautiful place - just before the reached the town passed a great no. of huts - land level and little houses about hid in the trees. Saw two Indian squaws with their papooses on their backs   Saw Onondaga Lake with the pump and vats and dry by apparatus for making salt. Learned to night that asked night that we can not reach Buffalo till next week and must be out over the Sabbath. The Captain says it will be impossible for him to stop on that day - what we shall do we know not. None of us can endure the idea of travelling on the Sabbath - Hope duty will be made plain. \nJune 5 Had a season of prayer this morning with special reference to the decision which must be made with regard to going on over the Sabbath or leaving the boat and stopping for the Sabbath. Passed Lyons - a beautiful place - got out and walked some distance by the bank of a winding stream (evening)  Eleven of us decided to leave the boat. Mrs. Wynn?  and Miss Chase?  went out at Newark and by inquiry found a minister Presbyterian and asked advice. On hearing the circumstances he said it was the most perplexing case he ever knew.

Purdue, in the name of the Lord give these sisters your hospitality who for consciences unclear stop to keep holy time.  They are a company of teachers going to the West\".

It should always be double even though we write but two or three lines (It shows a want of respect to seal it with a wafer  we must use sealing wax)  We must avoid using sealing wax when we are afraid that the seal may be opened if the letter is large use two seals A letter to be shown as a letter of introduction should never be prepared with a seal or pricked with a pin  A borrowed book should be covered with paper  If when we enter the house of any one we hear persons talking in an earnest way we stop more heavily in order to give notice to those who are engaged in the conversation.  If in an assembly two persons retire by themselves to talk of business we should be careful not to approach them nor speak to them until they have separated.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":99903,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/99903","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d0807e0c9fae1960f8a680f0be1dbaf7.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d0807e0c9fae1960f8a680f0be1dbaf7.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d0807e0c9fae1960f8a680f0be1dbaf7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d0807e0c9fae1960f8a680f0be1dbaf7.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-20T01:39:25+00:00","modified":"2020-06-26T10:37:21+00:00","filename":"d0807e0c9fae1960f8a680f0be1dbaf7.jpg","authentication":"6d9ad4cb467417463200866a18a7537d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_05_fl_128_005_004_o2.jpg","size":1214267,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

No preaching to day-- spent my time at home in reading and singing-- had not opportunity to go any where to chh.  O may God enable me to spend this year far better and more to his glory than any former year of my life.

I earnestly desire if it is his will that we may all see it close in health and happiness but \"not my will but thine be done\".  Glory we all be useful while we are spared and spend our lives in God's good work.\nJan. 9. Sabbath. Elder Knopp preached at eleven- very few out  things look indeed very discouraging in a religious point of view- O that I felt more of a spirit of ardent prayer to God for my pupils and others who are careless.  Without God's blessing nothing can be done, and he has promised to hear the prayer of faith, I need more faith more love more devotedness to the cause of my savior.\nSab. Jan 16. Sabbath.  Such an interesting meeting- my heart condemns me daily because I do no more for God- but I do wish to do good and may my God help me to accomplish much.  I feel more than ever anxious for my dear pupils- may God make me the instrument of much good to them-\nSab. Jan. 30.

9.1851 Father preached - Forenoon 2 Cor. 4.11.  1. Consider the prominent graces which adorn the Savior's character.  1. Humility. 2. Patience 3. Devotedness 4. Decision and Forgiveness. 5. Prayerfulness.  2. The importance of imitating these.\nAfternoon - Galatians. 4.18 -\n1.The nature of true zeal. 1. It springs from knowledge.  2. It is induced by good motives of heart  3. It is directed in the right way to the accomplishment of the best ends\n2. It is duty of every one to posses true zeal for God.  Every Christian should be active in laboring for God.  Soon the night will come and no more opportunity be offered to \ncooperate with God in the glorious work of the world's conversion.\nJan 16 - (Father)\nForenoon - Psalms 119-129 - \"Thy testimonies are wonderful.\"  The bible is a wonderful book, not only because of its Author but because of the contents.  The doctrines it reveals - the precepts it (contains) enforces - The history it discloses - all are wondrous - It tells us of the character of God. \"Glorious in holiness fearful in praises, doing wonders\" It also tells us the character of man.  naturally sinful, totally depraved - wholly opposed to all that is good and holy. \nMany efforts have been made to destroy the Bible - to banish it entirely from the world, but it has stood, while empires and kingdoms have fallen.

These words are found at the close of the sermon on the Mount, where the feelings of the people are described, with reference to the instructions they had been receiving they \"were astonished at His doctrine\". God's words shall not been without effect.  It was proposed to consider some things which are essential to render human teaching effective.  1. To render human teaching effectual it must be in accordance with God's Word.  2.  The truth of God's Word must be presented in unclear.  Some minds delight to dwell on the mysteries of the Bible - it's knowledge, or for the many varieties of intellect displayed.  They lose sight of the peace of redemption therein revealed. they forget the words of Christ - \"What shall it profit a man if he gain the wider world, & lose his own soul?\"  3.  Then should be an adaptation of divine truth to the various necessities and circumstances of our fellow beings.  \"A word, rightly spoken, is like apples of gold, in pictures of silver\".

It consists not in a physical change or a change of the intellectual powers; but of the affections of the heart.  Sin is not a physical malady.  Were  it such, it would require a physical change.  Regeneration is important because it is essential to repentance - without it we cannot have true love to God - nor can we all be prepared for the pleasures and employments of Heaven.  Aug. 24. Father preached.  Forenoon from James 2.17. \"Even so, faith, if it ihave not works, is dead, being alone.\"  Subject was the importance of manifesting faith by works.  1.  It is important because not thus to manifest faith proves it to be spurious.  True faith will be displayed in the life.  2 The honor of God demands it.  3.

Consider some evidences by which we sinners try ourselves, to know whether indeed we are true disciples of Jesus\n1.  The true Christian loved all in whom he sees the image of his divine master and loves them because they are like Jesus.  \"We know\", says the apostle \"that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren.  He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.\"\n2. A feeling of good will towards all men, is requisites even towards seen enemies.  In this we have our Savior's example.  He died for sinners, for those even, who were his murderers.  It was love and good will to all which led him to give his life to save poor ruined man.\n3. Delight in the character of God & in communion with him, is an evidence of Christian character.

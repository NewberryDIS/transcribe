There are several business streets the Bazar is one here are exposed for sale beads roots beans cloths cottons knives callicos silks &c  all the cotton goods I saw were marked Lowell Mills  in fact Most of the goods I saw were Yankee goods.  on the sides in the doors and windows were exposed these things for sale whilst back in a close room was the sleeping apartments.  The bazar that was some times crowded with Negroes [?] and loitering about.  Next the Market street was the most important  There was every thing to be seen that the isle produced in the way of eatables but usually in such small quantities that it was difficult to obtain enough for more than one person without going to a dozen.  Then came the private streets dirty and crooked but not as bad as the public ones.  in every street that I went the Natives looked at me with curious expressions and all seemed as friendly as could be.  The little negroe children seemed amused at me and when two or three of us were together we were followed like a Militia Company is in the states in every street we went there we found the Natives as kind and as polite as curious and inquisitive as Yankees, many poor devils asked me to step in and look at their sick brothers or sisters or fathers.  Many asked me for charms and I followed the example of Mongo Park who gave them the lords prayer,  in many streets I saw black smiths and was induced to stop to look at their work.  The black smith does all his work sitting down.  he has a little shaver who blows the bellows, does it also sitting down.  he blows it with two bags of leather open at top and fitted with two pieces of wood air tight which he opens as he draws it out with thumb and hands.  And shuts as he pushes it from him to keep the air in better pieces of soft hide or skins are fastened on the inside all their work is done sitting  there are also silver smiths on a small scale near the out skirts of the town are a kind of mills to grind the palm oil out of coco & palm trees  the mill was moved by Camels.  The palm oil is sent to America & Europe.  The Town contains about 30,000 inhabitants, Mostly Negroes who are slaves to the Arabs, Banyans, Parsees &c.  the Mosques are very numerous and are well built neat buildings one that I entered was extremely well furnished and clean and was full of worshipers it is the law of the Coran or Koran that an unbeliever entering a Mosque must either turn Mohometan or be put to death;  This is the law every where but in Madagascar and in Mozambique the law has changed this much that you can get off by paying a sum of money.  but here it is different for they are Arab and the Sultan is sei-seid Ben Sultan a true believer and defender of the faith.  Not knowing the custom I mounted the steps leading to the Mosque and entered the door.   There was several fellows on all fours bowed to the ground.  At first I thought they were fastening down the mats but then I saw them get up all facing the same way, bow and down again.   I had hardly time to see these things before I was caught by the arm by one of the Consuls friends who pulled me down off and away in short order I had hardly time to see the half drawn knives and angry glances of the Arabs before I was out of danger.  Capt Wilson gave me a severe lecture about it saying that there were many fanatics who would think it right & proper and that to kill me would please god and the prophet.  After I was more careful and kept a proper distance from them.  The Mohometan confession of faith is this Allah el Allah.  Mahome Ras-ul or god is great and Mahome is his prophet.

There are some learned men amongst the Arabs that is they can read and write and understand the Motions of the planets.   They also have schools the teachers generally get about 10 cts per month from each child.   I saw one who was teaching two youngsters the Koran.  he appeared to know it by heart and read it off in a sort of song as fast as he could talk there is but few or in fact I believe none who can read the bible off the same way (from Memory) for page after page.   When I first saw the Koran I took it for a badly constructed music book.  the reason was the size and musick note like shape of the letters, and the tone and manner of sort o' half singing or chanting it out,  the Banyans or Hindoos are the next most numberous class they are the go ahead sort of people of asia and are great business men of the place.  being the Yankees of Asia.  they Worship a cow and have many strange and superstitious customs.  they believe in a great and universal being who is eternal.  that he made the World has three distinct shapes the above being has various passions and that he delights in assuming the shape of a Cow.  so they purify themselves with cow dung and urine and make gods of wood & copper which they offer sugar honey &c.  they think the the Brahems came from the head and that other mortals came from the more inferior parts of his body.  The Parsees are another sect.  They are also industrious people and are the Jews of Asia.   They have the same religion as the Christians and Jews.  in Their books with this difference.  that they have a Zooroaster as a prophet.  And they think that God is the sun and that his spirit is the flame of fire.  They have their feast of unleaven bread their confessions of sin &c.  but the common people worship fire and the sun without knowing their reference. and this religion once pretty and good is now a blind Idolatry or what is called.  A Parsee will not blow out a light with his breath on any account.  if his house catches on fire he lets it burn down.  Their books tell the same tale about the Creation of the World the fall of Man &c. besides these there are many who worship snakes, lizards, bits of wood, stone, smoke, bones &c.  there are no white men on the island except foreigners.  The Arabs are dark skinned fine featured but as dark as our indians.  The Banyans and Parsees are the same the Negroes are as black as the devils boots.  There was a story related to me here which if true is not more than might be expected.  An Arab man and woman had a child.  he was born and was as black as any Negro on the isle.  I saw the man myself he had been sent to England and was well educated and a smart intelligent fellow with a good deal of humor.  Now if the Arab woman who was a respectable one and of high birth was true to her lord does this not prove that the people of Africa have one day turned black.    Back of the town is the burying ground in fact part of the town is built over the burying ground,  it is very irregular and is full of bushes briars and young bamboo canes.  Wild dogs are as thick as hops in it and live and stay there to feed on the dead bodies of the slaves which are brought out but never buried.  I saw several dead Negroes during my stay one of them was on the sea beach.  They allways make it a custom never to bury slave but let dogs eat them or fish devour them.

Near the grave yard is a strait piece of road which the Natives use to run races on them near here also is the slave Market.   There are annually sold, in Zanzibar, upwards of 15,000 slaves.  They are all bought from Africa and are seldom or never fed till they find a master.  Many of them die with hunger and at most they never get more than a hand full of rice.   After they find a Master it is quite a different affair for then they are use by the laws of the Koran to eat when their Master does to eat what he does and the Master is obliged to furnish each slave with a new suit of clothes every time that he buys one himself.  in fact slavery amongst the Arabs is nothing more than serving amongst Christians.   A slave is allowed to speak his mind and works only when he feels like it.  this is the law but the law is not followed. Always and a slaves life then is truely miserable.  it also orders in the Koran that if a slave turn Mahometan he is free but this their master wont allow them to do.  there is a strong  bridge at the north end of the town over an arm of the sea it  is strong but rough.  On the sea Coast is a large square fort with high round towers at each corner.  it was built by the Portuguese in 1537. and no doubt was a strong fort. just in front of this fort is the water battery mounting 22 guns, some of them in good order.   This town and isle was first discovered by the Portuguese who found it inhabited by Negroes and Arabs.  The Portuguese took possession built the fort and flourished for a while but the cupidity averice cruelty and ignorance of human nature soon reduced the place to almost a place of desolation and they possessed authority no further than the range of their long guns.   In the city they established an inquisition which inspired dread they erected a cross and prostrated them selves before and the Mahometans and Savages took them for idolators, the wild negroes and arabs from Africa were afraid to come over for they were liable to be burned at the stake for being heathens.  so at length by the abuse of the laws of Heaven and earth and of all laws of nature humanity and justice and of even law written on in the heart of Man Zanzibar came but an empty possession thus it continued.  The Portuguese fed and fattened on the blood sweat and toil of the Arabs and Negroes till their name was a name of repoch [sic] and hatred as well as of fear and dread.  About 60 years ago the Sultan of Arabia at Mecca sent Ben Sultan the present sultan's father to Muscat to attend to some important business being ambitious and enterprising he soon amassed a large fortune.

The Sultan of Mecca then sent army after army but Ben Sultan defeated them all took all the sea port towns and declared himself Sultan of Arabia upon this the Sultan at Mecca sued for peace which was granted on his ceding all his territory from the mouth of Gulf of Persia to Mozambique inclusive and declairing Ben Sultan the sultan of Muscat  this was done  Ben Sultan then with his troops sailed for Zanzibar landed there","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103417,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103417","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/233f3c64fb91a4580bf53dfb5ac4a00d.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/233f3c64fb91a4580bf53dfb5ac4a00d.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/233f3c64fb91a4580bf53dfb5ac4a00d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/233f3c64fb91a4580bf53dfb5ac4a00d.jpg"},"added":"2020-09-21T21:17:32+00:00","modified":"2020-10-12T00:43:57+00:00","filename":"233f3c64fb91a4580bf53dfb5ac4a00d.jpg","authentication":"2a219dc0b68479d392356153db000825","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"NL_VAULT_Ayer_MS_119_0126_o2.jpg","size":3065326,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3286,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.086374461802033},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"233f3c64fb91a4580bf53dfb5ac4a00d.jpg","FileDateTime":1600722990,"FileSize":3065326,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3286\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3286,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0},"IFD0":{"Model":"Microbox GmbH - Book2Net","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5.7.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:03:02 08:04:24"},"EXIF":{"ExifVersion":230}}}},"item":{"id":1285,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1285","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"and ordered the Portuguese garrison to surrender this they refused upon which the sultan attacked the place on two sides at once. at first they were repelled for the Portuguese knew their fate if he succeeded the next day he again tried it on all sides.  it was a long well fought battle the Portuguese stood to their guns till the last.  the Musslemen had made scaling ladders of bamboo.  these they fixed on the walls but the Portuguese threw them down men and all, but the Arabs were soon up and at it again.  but now the Portuguese had began to grow weaker  Many of their guns could not be worked for want of Men and the Arabs growing more furious again attempted scaling.  this time tho gallantly opposed they succeeded the Portuguese were slaughtered like sheep, and few were spared to tell the tale.

We found it literaly [sic] covered with sea or aquatic fowls so numerous that we had to be careful to push them away.   They were so tame that they disputed the ground with us and pinched our legs as we passed.  We sent out boats to sound and about 12 M got underway.  for 8 or 10 days we had light airs gradually hauling from the N' & E' to the N' & W'  During the night watches we kept a bright look out and for a look out to be caught asleep here abouts was certain punishment.  The cause of this was that we were cruising in that part of the sea which abounds in coral reefs where many ships had been lost and where new shoals are discovered almost every day.  We passed in sight of Aldabra isle. passed the Seychelle isles.  The Seychelle isles are  small group of isles lying to the N' of Madagascar.   They are inhabited by Malagash and french men.  Tis on this isle that a singular tree grows which has never been found in any other part of the world.  The nuts are called Coco De Mer. and at one time were thought to have grown in the sea.  Some of them were picked up on the coast of Hindustan and they brought [?] their weight in gold.   On the 10th Decr found ourselves in the little Monsoon.   This is a west wind which blows along the line fair and fresh for vessels bound east.  It rained all the time sometimes in squalls sometimes in a steady pour.  it would have been but little trouble to have filled the ship up but it was neglected.  This weather was quite refreshing to us for the Channel wheather [sic] had universally been hot sultry and melting weather.   Now we found it quite pleasant for the rains cooled the atmosphere.  Decr 20th an old fore-mast man died suddenly.  he had only been sick 2 days.  This cast a general gloom over the ship for this was the 1st death.  the sick list had been increasing gradually since leaving Zanzibar and there was now 50 on the list:  This old fellow died without any one near him and was found next morning standing up against the bulk-head dead.  We buried him our 1st lieut lead prayers and the blue indian Ocean is his grave.  On the 23rd on [sic] the bandsmen died.  he had been sick a long time his son was near him all the time of his sickness.  we buried him as we had done the other with the usual ceremonies of half masting the flag and reading prayers.  Decr. 25th: today  is Christmas.  to day we crossed the line and to day we crossed the 180th Meridian of my Home. and to day appeared the comet and to day was a beautiful sunset.  how many things seem to happen this day.   I am sure it must be a good sign.  The Sultan had given us a goat which we had been saving all along for a Christmas dinner.   I had also bought a large lot of chickens in Zanzibar and intended to save them for Christmas but hard usage was too hard for them and we had to kill them to save their lives.  Decr 31st an old forecastle man died we buried him at sea.  New years day.  Made the high land of Sumatra.  Winds being light we anchored about 18 miles from the land.

She reported to us that two pirates had been seen in the offing but seeing us had made sail for other parts.  Quallah Battoo was taken and burned some yars ago by the American Frigate Columbia for having taken an American Ship and Murdered the crew.  She at the same time burned Muckie.  Since then they have respected American ships.  There was an old  ugly devil on board yesterday who entertained the Mids with an Account of the Murder of the Crew of a French Man &  some of the Mids were very anxious to knock the old devil on the head for his crimes.  but it was not our business or policy. so we had to let the old devil alone and laugh at our selves for our anger.

There are Many large and navagable [sic] rivers on the island rising in the Mountains of the interior.   On the West Coast the rivers are swift on the east Coast they have slow currents and frequently overflow their banks.  On these rivers are imense [sic] impenetrable jungles looking thick enough to cut slices out, aye almost solid.  These jungles are always green and the vines and bushes twine into each other, so that a man can not see into them.  There they are filled with all manner of wild animals, amongst them stands the tiger, as number one both on account of his strength and numbers.  There is also 2 or 3 lakes in the interior, one of which is about 60 miles long, and 40 wide.  The scenery around these lakes is beautifully grand and picturesque.  I dare say they equal if not surpass the scenery around the Scotish lakes which we read and hear so much of, and it may be that some day.  A Malay Walter Scott, will give them to the world, in words and letters, as Scott has done before them.  There are numerous villages on the banks fo these lakes and they are so thickly shaded with the spreading mangrove, that it difficult to discover the bamboo huts of the Natives.  Nor is this all.  fruit of all kinds common to the climate flourishes without cultivation.  Pea-cocks with their beautiful plumage strut thro the forests, wild, and others pick their food near the huts of the Natives tame,  Chickens (how strange it seems) are here wild and are hunted by the Natives for food.   It is not an uncommon thing to hear the Cock a doodle doo in these jungles, on the lakes which are said to be clear and so deep that they look blue and black, are numerous proas light and graceful looking boats.  Some of these boats carry whole families who live and die in them, literally never leaving the water.  near the lakes and extending their bases to it, and their rocks over it, is the chain of high cloud capped mountains which run thro the whole extent of the island.  Thousands of fish hawks hover over these limpid lakes diving into its clear bosom for their prey and hundreds of grey eagles sit on the high cliffs watching the industrious hawks & then pursuing them and seizing the fruits of their labour.  The bird of paradise called so on account of its beautiful notes and brilliant plumage flock in the woods.  serpants black bright and glistening ones sun them selves in every path.  Porcupines with their thorny backs burrow in the old stumps.  scorpions are under the rocks Tarantulas and centipedes on every bush and lizards of immense size creep amongst the tall grass.  Alegators  almost choak the rivers and wild dogs bay and growl at the live Man and feast and fatten on dead.  deer feed on the grass and lie in the shade of the immense jungles unmolested except by the jungle cats and tigers in these jungles monkes [sic] Apes, baboons and oragitangs are as numerous as [?] in a thickly settled country.  in some parts of the isle are whole forests of Camphor trees, and in others forests of the banyan tree  this tree grows to immense sizes for one who has never seen them it is almost impossible to conceive the size they attain and their noble appearance.  Amongst the smaller trees gives one an idea that they are the king of all trees, some of these trees attain the heights of 5 or 600 feet and the largest one ever known was 1100 feet and cast a shadow of more than 1000 yards.  the Main trunk covered an acre of ground and tis said that the whole body of the tree was one thousand yards in circumference in the river bottoms and other rich and level lands.\n[bottom of page torn off]","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103423,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103423","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/5919388b18b951ac7d48d8bab3c4f7df.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/5919388b18b951ac7d48d8bab3c4f7df.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/5919388b18b951ac7d48d8bab3c4f7df.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5919388b18b951ac7d48d8bab3c4f7df.jpg"},"added":"2020-09-21T21:17:41+00:00","modified":"2020-10-14T03:58:26+00:00","filename":"5919388b18b951ac7d48d8bab3c4f7df.jpg","authentication":"72d1efb58c76328cb4fe62585e672e5f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"NL_VAULT_Ayer_MS_119_0132_o2.jpg","size":2845750,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":3287,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.080162875074649},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5919388b18b951ac7d48d8bab3c4f7df.jpg","FileDateTime":1600722990,"FileSize":2845750,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"3287\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":3287,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0},"IFD0":{"Model":"Microbox GmbH - Book2Net","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Lightroom 5.7.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:03:02 08:04:28"},"EXIF":{"ExifVersion":230}}}},"item":{"id":1285,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1285","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"some of these trees are so Much larger than the common ones that at a distance they look like large hills, covered with verdure. in its thick branches whole droves of apes monkes and orangotans find shelter.  in its cool shade droves of Cattle hogs and other animals find a resting place.  The fabled tree which threw out its poisonous vapors for 20 miles around killing birds and beasts and trees or rather all animal and vegetable matter was said to exist in this island.  the story arose from a tradition of the Natives which had reference to a volcano instead of a tree but the dutch (who first settled this isle) from their ignorance of the Malay language thought it a tree and so spread the report and hence the {crossed out: fable} story.  Orang-o-tang which is a Malay word means Man of the Woods so orang-o-pulto means Men of the sea or sailors.  The orang-o-tang is very numerous.  The Malays say that they live together in towns built of leaves and sticks in the impenetrable jungles. and subsist on the animal and vegetable matter that the woods afford.  There are said to be two different species differing in the texture and color of the hair the one called the Cooboo is said to be very much like the human race. so much so that the Malays are said to take some of the most likely cooboo girls to wife  the offspring after the 2 or 3 generation loose all appearance of the orang o tang in their wild state they build huts and frequently attack tigers and elephants for food on the approach of a Man they always run off and are quite harmless unless wounded.   They can be taught almost any thing I have seen them sweep out a room and others have been learned to wait on the table.   Tigers which are very numerous and dangerous attacking the Malays almost every day.  never attack the orang-o-tang but on the contrary the orang o tangs attack them with clubs &c and either break their heads or strangle them with their long sinewy arms.  They are very strong for some times they when wounded will pick up a Malay and run up a tree the same as a Man would pick up a child and walk off.  in fighting with the Malays they with one blow will break an arm or leg.  some of them grow to the highth of 8 or 9 feet and after killing a buffaloe will pick it up and walk off.  Now all the above about the orang o tang May be a yarn but I give it as the Malays tell it, The Malays have a kind of superstitious dread concerning tigers thinking they are some way connected with God on that account they Never hunt them nor kill them except in cases of necessity.

Which would be an easy matter if it were not for the unhealthiness of the climate.  The isle is divided into Numerous petty kingdoms and Clans each at war with the other they take scalps sometimes after the Manner of our indians.  The dutch have settled the south part of the island and have several large factories.  they are nearly always at war with the natives.  There is one man who is called king of the isle living at Acheen but his power does not extend further than gun shot from his fort.  when the Malays kill any animal for food they never use fire arms if they can help it but turn its head towards Mecca and kill it.  Most of them are Mohometans but there are Many who have no religion at all and others who are what the Christians call Idolaters tho not more so than the Christians for they all use emblems and the Christians being more refined makes a pretty one whilst the poor Malay paints or carves a hideous one.  tho with the same intention  one is said to worship god the other idols. and this is said by Christians who [?most?] the Malays call us idolators.  Some distinguished divine wrote a Christian hymn saying the indian in his blindness bows down to wood and stone, where as they pray to god as much as Christians.  And if a Hindu should come into a Catholic church would they not suppose we were Idolaters or in other churches would they not think we pray to nothing at all.  The Malays use the poisoned knife on almost every occasion.  The poison is the juice of a green pine apple.  a slight wound from one of these knives is nearly always fatal in 3 or 4 hours.  Every town on the sea coast builds one or more Pirate piroas.  Some of them carry 10 or 15 guns and 50 or 60 men  these fellows board unarmed vessels and put all to death neither giving or receiving quarter.  some times they attack armed Merchant Men and are not infrequently successful.  Pepper is the principal export of the island tho other articles of greater value exist.  Nut Megs pine apples. Cinnamon. Gum Benjamin, cloves &c grow wild.   rice is also raised in large quantities.   Rice is to the east the same as wheat to the west to attempt to enter into an account of all the products of the isle or even a small part of them would be useless.

Their plays are said to have more of the comedie than of the tragic about them, their songs are always sung in an unnatural voice and it seems to be with great difficulty that they sing any thing  their music is of a very rude kind such as almost to shock one.  it appeared to me something like the sharpening of a saw and the rattleing of a cart.  The Malays here are a very piratical race and are remarkable for being a desperate set of fellows neither giving or receiving quarter.  they are mortal enemies to the chinese and kill them on every opportunity.  such is the dread  of the Chinese for the Malay that they have formed secret bands for the purpose of protection and should a Malay be killed by one of this band no other of the band or other chinese dare give evidence against him,  The Chinese here are two thirds of the population and no doubt will soon drive the Malays out of the country.  The Malays are very much like our indians in these respects, in their war dances in their marriages and in their scalping the dead.  another thing they resemble the Indians in is their inordinate desire for spirits and their fast disappearance before as well as their dislike to civilized life.

And the vallies either filled with thick forests or cultivated field, there are several islands in the bay of Manilla, all of which have a few inhabitants.  The City of Manilla is built on a level plain and at a short distance its numerous forts and domes and spires give it a beautiful and imposing appearance, besides this the City is divided into two parts one called the Spanish town and the other the Native town.  the Native town is nearly twice as large as the White but the White city is very strongly fortified and walled it is as strong a place as I have seen for a long time  a ditch surrounds the whole place about 30 feet wide and full of water.  on the most assailable point there are three walls and two ditches with drawbridges & the whole city of Manilla may be said to be built amongst churches for near every 10th house is a church.  and such churches as are seldom seen viz large Massive buildings with high towering steeples and deep toned bells and the whole interior is decorated with images & painting of our Saviour which pious fathers and sisters have from time to time presented to the church, some of these paintings I have heard were very old and so they looked and some of them were remarkably well executed.  The altars are usually nearby and in many instances are gorgeously decorated with gilt or gold ornaments, these set off by numerous lights which are kept continually burning, besides which as it was a feast day or rather a Collection of feasts and the alters were decorated with branches of orange and other trees, which gave the whole church an air of quietness and innocence that would [crossed out: have been] be difficult to describe.   The Choirs of these churches are usually very good even excellent, one day whilst passing near the factories I heard a remarkably sweet strain of music proceeding from a church when I entered it I observed all persons on their knees and some few looked hard at me, so as I thought it would rude to go out without showing at least a proper respect and that I had so far only shown a rude curiosity which would be almost inexcusable","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":103472,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/103472","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/f8c25ef64df7b3c4488a616624084354.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/f8c25ef64df7b3c4488a616624084354.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/f8c25ef64df7b3c4488a616624084354.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f8c25ef64df7b3c4488a616624084354.jpg"},"added":"2020-09-21T21:18:54+00:00","modified":"2020-09-25T04:05:40+00:00","filename":"f8c25ef64df7b3c4488a616624084354.jpg","authentication":"3f1b3cd5f3d07bc3a77c7510b85ce65b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"NL_VAULT_Ayer_MS_119_0181_o2.jpg","size":2794992,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":0,"item":{"id":1285,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1285","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"so without more ado down I knelt between two girls, and of course they made room for me, when I out-watch bill and commenced saying my pater noster with as good a grace as I well knew how.  by and by I began to get very tired of kneeling there as the pavement was very hard, and I observed that all of the girls had so rolled up their dresses that they made a sort of cushions, and again I observed that I was nearly the only male in the house that the whole church was full of females and only one or two males.  by and by several ladies & girls rose up near me and started out I followed. glad to be released from the painful position of kneeling.  they stoped at the Holy found and sprinkled their faces, crossing themselves.  I did the same, when I heard an old lady say, bueno Catolico! and another, bien Christiano!  Once out of the church I was not in a hurry to go back but was looking which way I should go and wondering where all these women came from, going idly along I happened to take the same direction with those girls between whom I was kneeling and on passing them one or two called out, hist! hist! and asked me if I was an Americano. or engleise on answering they asked me to go to their house which I did. and was well treated, and requested to call again which I did several times during our stay.  They always received me kindly and the girls were so interesting and pretty that tho I could only half understand them, I became quite smitten and when I left Manilla it was with a sigh.

However I got a good lignumvitae stick and swore if the Cholow press gang came about Me I would give them the hardest end.  I was then as I have said 19 or 20  I was as stout as an ox and my young blood almost piped thro my veins {crossed out words].  I had scarcely emptied my glass and turned round to go down and relieve the others in the boat to allow them to come up and freshen the nip (there was 6 of us) when we were attacked by the Brazilian press gang there was about 20 of them and I tell you what we made them stand for it for our sticks and jack knives were severe tho not dangerous weapons.  however after a hearty beating we were obliged to knock under and all of us boat keepers and all were put on board of the Don Pedro 64 [?] frigate, where we were forced to sign articles and in about 3 weeks we left on a cruise.  She was a fine ship her battery was of the best and all 32s  She was a fast sailer and was officered by english officers with a few Spanish senors.

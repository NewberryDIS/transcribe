The agencies are at present insulated points in the Indian Country, connected together only be their mutual responsibility to the War Department.  The Department is remote, the communication slow, and the necessary details not always sufficiently understood there, nor fully explained by the Agent. The principal is perfectly analagous to the beautiful simplicity which in theory prevails in military arrangements, and I have no doubt it would be found useful and efficacious.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":115157,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/115157","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/34b14132fc03db2361a341a307e77dd6.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/34b14132fc03db2361a341a307e77dd6.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/34b14132fc03db2361a341a307e77dd6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/34b14132fc03db2361a341a307e77dd6.jpg"},"added":"2020-11-25T17:34:10+00:00","modified":"2021-01-18T18:25:27+00:00","filename":"34b14132fc03db2361a341a307e77dd6.jpg","authentication":"442f54c10a6bee5b818f566f53362e33","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_601_FL001_00019_o2.jpg","size":1050035,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1820,"resolution_y":2277,"compression_ratio":0.084459421415943}},"item":{"id":1359,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1359","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"36\nfor all the purposes of this enquiry.\nThe only remaining branch of this subject relates to the organization of the Indian Department, and from my experience I am inclined to think that with one essential and some minor alterations, the present system is as good as we shall easily obtain. I consider that the mode of direct communication between the Agents and the Indians, and of transacting the ordinary affairs of the agency cannot be improved.\nThe communication between the agent and the Government, and between the former and the Superintendant (sic)requires to be better defined and understood. The War Department must now be troubled with an immense multiplicity of details, which could better be considered upon the spot. although the agents are in some respects subject to the control of the Superintendent, still this power being undefined is exercised with much care and delicacy.\nIf the Agents were instructed to communicate with the Superintendant only the burthen (sic) upon the War

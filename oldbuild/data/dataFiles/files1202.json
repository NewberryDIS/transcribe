The Current was setting so strong out that we were carried Sideways among the breakers in great danger of being capsized. --  After two hours hard pulling we at last arrived at the town with no more injury than a good ducking from the spray. --  The town of Alvarado is situated  on the north bank of the river of the Same name about half a mile from its mouth, and in front of the town the river is about a mile broad, and perfectly safe from any wind. --  The north bank is composed of Sandhills, among which the town is situated, but on the south it is a deep swamp covered with a forest of bamboos and shrubs. --  Alvarado till now that the merchants from Vera Cruz have been obliged to take refuge in it, was little more than a fishing village. --  It contains about ten or twelve stone and brick houses and a church with a dome & spire with 5 or 6 bells, and two or three hundred houses or rather huts built of bamboo and wood.  The population consists of about three thousand of all possible shades and colors.  At present the place is healthy. --","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":92703,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/92703","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/e2476f17c06b86f566f10b3e953b43fa.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/e2476f17c06b86f566f10b3e953b43fa.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/e2476f17c06b86f566f10b3e953b43fa.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e2476f17c06b86f566f10b3e953b43fa.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-10T18:13:14+00:00","modified":"2020-07-08T12:19:29+00:00","filename":"e2476f17c06b86f566f10b3e953b43fa.jpg","authentication":"38fa73357dac9d89166b9c04fcc5ce4f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_1047_00140_o2.jpg","size":1774784,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2480,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.06626284348865},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120605"],"TimeCreated":["141232+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120605"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120605"],"TimeCreated":["141232+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120605"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120605"],"TimeCreated":["141232+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120605"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e2476f17c06b86f566f10b3e953b43fa.jpg","FileDateTime":1586542217,"FileSize":1774784,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2480\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2480,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:08:21 14:53:18","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":180},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:05 14:12:32","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:05 14:12:32","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":14,"SubSecTimeDigitized":14,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2682,"ExifImageLength":3892,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1202,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1202","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"In the neighbourhood there is also produced Corn, beans, chile, &c. sufficient for the consumption of the place.

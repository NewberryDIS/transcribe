In conversing with the switchmen I find that they remember how the striking engineers acted during the switchmens' strike some time since. The switchmen claim that the switch engineers at that time instead of attending strictly to their own line of business also performed the duties of the switchmen. Many railroad men think the firm stand taken by the \"Q\" road in the present contest will be a great help towards preventing railroad strikes in the future. They also think that had the company yielded to the demands of the strikers trouble would be likely to occur in other departments during the summer.

Afternoon Opr went up past the Hall & from there to Noonan Bros but did not see any one until after meeting when there was 8 or 9 came in from there. Opr talked with Mike Shields, Shorty, Allen, Campbell, Printy, unclear and Tom Larkin. All said it was too hot to do any business in the Hall and that there was none to do anyway - they say things are just the same. That they go up there, read the communications from along the line call the roll and adjourn. They say the men will ever give in and if the strike is settled it will by by concessions from the Company- the $40.00 per month makes the Boys very loyal to the Cause. There were 8 or 10 strikers in Noonan Bros. who were unknown to Opr. They were going some where so Opr stayed there until 11.35 they had all gone but 2 or 3 and they came away when Opr did. \nSaturday August 4th 1888.

The Political Club is booming and as soon as they are organized, they intend to come out as an Independent Club and show their strength and in that way they think they will attract the attention of Office Seekers and get them to pledge themselves to the boys. Aside from this there is nothing new in regard to the strike. They don't know when there will be a change but they are ready for one of most any kind! Opr stayed at Noonan Bros a short time and went to dinner and then went back there again! and remained there until 8 o'clock but learned nothing more. \nYours Truly Pinkerton National Detective Agcy per W.A.

Monday Aug 6th 1888\nOpr Reports that pursuant to instructions from Mr Paris he went out to the Race Tracks with some young men among whom 3 were strikers nothing was said about the strike they were all nice fellows apparently. at 7pm. Opr went to Mr Paris' room and was introduced to Mr McDaniel assistant Round house ? at Aurora who is to take Mr Paris place for a short time Opr then went up into the ? Yard and found that 2 switches had no lamps on them and found a 3d switch with a lamp on but the light was nearly out Opr thinks whoever has charge of those lamps is negligent and at 10pm Opr informed Mr Paris of the lamps by sending him a note and when Opr returned to the switches and went up to them he saw a man standing a short distance away. The man saw Opr and walked away up to the switch when Opr left it. Opr says if such occurrences should happen often he cannot keep under cover long.

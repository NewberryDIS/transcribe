We were all very sorry to have him go. it seemed as though\n\n\nand Johnnie can be here too. I hope you will visit soon again. We are so glad to get your letters.

We are expecting Uncle Thompson and Uncle Butler out soon, probably in two or three weeks, if not before, and I have thought some of going back with them. I thought perhaps I could go to N.Y. first, and stop a few days, and get some comfort and advice from my good little Aunt Mary, and then go on to Boston and see Dr. Williams, who is quite a noted oculist. Would it trouble you too much to have me a day or two? I should want to help you some way, to make up for the bother, when you are so busy. I have suffered so long from my eyes, it seems as though I must do something for them. We are having the sitting room plastered and papered new, this week, and it has made me considerable extra work, which have affected my eyes some. If I get tired or heated, they are a good deal worse. I am very glad that John Eddie has gone to Mexico to school. Johnnie and Azia will enjoy having  him there very much. He is such a good boy, and such a good student, he will be a help to them, and I hope they will be able to be a help to him He will think a great deal of Azia I know. She never has anything to do with any one, without doing them some good.

Kendall,\nDear Sir, Nearly two months have elapsed since I saw you last and it realy seems a long time. Although it has passed rapidly. You will perhaps expect to hear from me soon & in account with my promise I sit down this afternoon to write a letter. Letters from absent friends and acquaintances are always very acceptable to me here at College. I often wish I had more of them.  it affords me such comfort and satisfaction to read them and often to re-read them. I hope therefore that among your many correspondent you will\nnot fail to afford me as early a reply as your time & convenience will permit. \nI had deigned previously to this to take this opportunity to offer in brief\nsome the reasons for a few of the opinions which I hold respecting some particular\nscriptures doctrines. Opinions which I freely admit I have been brought up\nto believe in, but which perhaps are not the less likely to be true on\nthat account.  I am willing to admit that I regard most of the\ncreed usually called Calomistic as true.  I am aware too that there\nis a good deal of prejudicial ?- many of the articles of that and\nas for example Endless punishment Vicarious atonement. Total Depravity\n& Regeneration.  Still we ought to remember that truth does not always wear\nthose specious garbs of beauty & delight with which we often would be glad\nto array her.  It is too often the case even now perhaps that \"many say\npeace when there is no peace\"  While I believe that there are many pleasant &\nbeautiful realities,  I also believe that there are many terrible and awful realities.\nWith regard to all these topics of course we have only to inquire what the Bible\nteaches & bow at once to its authority no matter if we can not understand\nwe must yet acquiesce in its assertions.  With reference to whether Christ\nis equal with God I will simply refer you to the following passages.  The 1st\nchap. of Heb.. particularly the 8th verse. & no. 5. 18 & 17.5 1 Tim..3.16","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42964,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/42964","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/b013d34028fe0c5533a18d4ed04b2b3b.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/b013d34028fe0c5533a18d4ed04b2b3b.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/b013d34028fe0c5533a18d4ed04b2b3b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b013d34028fe0c5533a18d4ed04b2b3b.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T16:09:36+00:00","modified":"2020-05-23T04:01:25+00:00","filename":"b013d34028fe0c5533a18d4ed04b2b3b.jpg","authentication":"1dd0aeab85048f6c0ab88fe57b29a47c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_093_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1780927,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2892,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057019587879719},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["045603"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["045603"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["045603"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b013d34028fe0c5533a18d4ed04b2b3b.jpg","FileDateTime":1509466152,"FileSize":1780927,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2892\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2892,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:09 13:49:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 04:56:03","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 04:56:03","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3354,"ExifImageLength":4175,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":187,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/187","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Indeed I consider it so clearly taught in the Bible that is entirely useless\nto argue it.

Now I believe\nthat Christ has set us an example which we are to follow 1 Pet. .2.21 &\nin proportion as we might the spirit of Christ So we shall be holy & happy\nLet me be distinctly understood, as saying that I believe it impossible \nfor a perfectly holy being to be unhappy & that in as much as Christ \nwas holy himself undefiled, If we live like him we\nshould be perfectly happy.  But I think that there was an object in\nChrists' death. In the first place we are all sinners & are all therefore\ntransgressors of God's law.  Now there is a penalty to that law, And by\nthis I do not mean the result of natural laws, I mean cruel\npenal infliction. Was not that the case in Eden.

Was the judgement on Annias & S. the result of natural laws.\nJust look at Gen 2.17, Ezk 18.4,Rom 6.23 & Jam(es) 1.15\nSin is the transgression of the law & \"this soul that giveth it shall die\nCan that mean natural death.  Then read the 9th and 7th verses of Ezk 18.\nPlaced then as we are under the law of God if we violate it we must\nsuffer the penalty.

I was at your house was doing so for the last time. Allow me, my dear Sir, to offer you my deepest sympathy worthless & unavailing as it may be. Ah! I know very well what a mother's love is. I know very well what meaning there is in the expression \" a mother's tenderness, a mother's watchfulness\". I know too what an aching void is left in your bosom when such a mother, so good a mother as your own, is is torn from your embrace. Yet what is your earthly loss I trust is her eternal gain, & that while weeping friends moan her departure, she is singing the song of redeeming grace & dying love. -- Perhaps I ought to offer an apology for intruding on your time & affection. So long a letter, on questions of theological controversy, yet I have none to offer except that I feel that a candid expression of ones views & feeling & the reasons for those view may be of incalculable advantage. The subject you treated of in your last letter was the divinity of Christ in connection with the divinity & to those 2 topics I will endeavor to confine myself in this letter. Allow me to say however by way of correcting my self, that it seemed to me that in your letter you have not endeavored to prove that Christ was not divine, but rather that he was not identical with the Father. Now I would not for a moment be understood as saying that Christ was literally & identically the same with the Father, & if that were all you were endeavoring to disprove in your letter, then I agree with you at once. Very likely I despeched the subject too hastily in my January letter. Still I was sorry you did not allude to one of the other papages & which I resend it inasmuch as you did not, they remain unnumbered. In a subject like this we must receive without hesitation the assertions of the Bible, although we ought to use our reason to determine what the scripture means, yet when it is once determined, we should believe with perfect confidence. We should be Careful about setting that down as ridiculous or about which we cannot understand, remembering that while with me things are impossible with God all things are possible. I said in my former letter that Christ was equal with God, by no means that he was identical with God the Father.

Permit me just briefly to review a few of the points you referred to in your letter. I perfectly agree with you in believing that Christ is the Son of God. Still that does not prevent his being equal to God. Nay the very fact that he is the Son would go to show that he was equal. As Christ himself says that men may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. You I presume will admit that there is in a sense an equality subsisting between Father & Son. --\nOf course I do not suppose that Paul intends to teach that himself & Apollos are one person, neither does Christ when he says \"I & my Father are one\" mean to say that he & his Father are identically the same person, but he does teach it seems to me as plain as language can teach that while he & his Father are distinct persons they are equal, equal in power & glory. So to in reference for Christ's followers being one, he prays that they may be united in that intimate bond of fellowship. One in feeling. In perfect equality as himself and his father are one. In reference to the trinity I will say but little. I consider it one of the most glorious truths in the whole Bible I do not see how many pages in the Bible can be explained without it. It seems as though we had some indication of it in Genesis when God says let us make man. Although it be a principle & may appear to you to be nothing more than a Hebrew w- term In Christ's baptism do we not have three divine manifestations the voice from Heaven, the Father, Jesus the Son & the dove the Holy Ghost & then what means this solemn language baptising them in the name of the Father * Son & H.G. three persons in the Godhead equal in power & glory. I believe that Christ was while on earth both God & man, that there was in him a mysterious union of the human & divine & it is something that is not at all more wonderful the union of soul & body in man. He was the God-man. The anthropy expresses just what I mean. That Christ was  am an neces?  no part of count, couse? That he was God I think you ought to admit if I can show that he had the following attributes - eternal existence, immutability, omniscience, omnipotence & omnipresence. If Christ had these qualities must he not be divine. ? his eternity. Before Abraham was I am. With his glory I had with thee before the world was & c. 2nd immutability. Jesus is the same yesterday today & forever. Heb 13. 8. & 3rd Omniscience for he knew what was in man John 2 21st  Lord thou knowest all things than knowest that I love thee John 21 17.4  omnipotence. I can do all things through him who strengthens me Ph. 4. 13  I am Alph & Omega, which is & was to come the Almighty. Rev. 1:8  5th omnipresence. When two or three are gathered together than am I in the midst. Mat 18, 20, the fulness of him that filleth all in all Eph 1.23 I might add on other passages but must we not from this admit that Christ is divine. I would extend my letter farther had I time. I love to dwell on the doctrines. I consider them glorious truth.  I hope that the consideration of this will do us both good. \nHope you will write soon. \nE. P.

I am in haste to offer you my congratulations on an event which I trust will be fraught with much happiness to yourself, and also to her on whom your affections are placed. Pray that happiness be unalloyed and unending. I could not but rejoice at the intelligence, because I think you are one who will know how to appreciate the love of a devoted wife, and are so well fitted to receive and confer enjoyment in domestic life. May the blessing of Him from whom cometh all our good gifts, attend you in your new relations, and may life henceforth be gilded with a brightness hitherto unknown. I feel that you will not have extra vagant?, ill-founded notions to be painfully corrected by experience, but that your anticipations, having been reasonable, will be realized. Life is not all sunshine, and it is vain to expect that a universal law will be set aside in our case, but if its \"rough ascent, its flowery slope\" will both lead us to the \"green fields and still water\" of the heavenly world, the glorious prospect may well reconcile us to any difficulties or trials, with which infinite wisdom sees fit that we should contend. Life, to me, means a different aspect from what it did when I last saw you. Written a few days after Mr. H. wrote you, I was attached with a bilious fever (brought on, he thinks, by mismanagement and a suspension of cold water treatment) and, for a time I felt, that in all probability, death was close at hand.

I think it was the early part of Nov. when she came home with a sore throat, before she recovered from this she had a sore come upon her limb just below her knee. The Doct. called it a carbuncle; a most painful thing it proved; --she was confined to her room five weeks -- at the end of that time was able to walk with difficulty. In 2 or 3 weeks from this time she went to Mr. Hapgood; (to stay while Mrs. H. went to Boston) while there was taken with another sore throat -- she has been there ever since, is recovering now. Have not much news (or small talk as Mrs. H. is pleased to denominate it) to communicate. Mary Stowell died about 3 weeks since, disease consumption, thought she should recover till within a few days of her death, was very happy the last two, -- her mother will feel the loss of her only daughter very deeply. Mr. Smith from Indiana is here now. I suppose he will carry Miss Weed away in a few days. Mary Bigelow in company with Mr. Royal Bosworth a widower from Boston is on a visit to Lowell. The probability is that Mary will leave Petersham. Mr. Putnam is at the hotel yet much against his wishes. He is very desirous of obtaining another boarding place. Hope he will bring Mrs. Putnam here in Spring. I spoke of an organ in anticipation, -- it has been contracted for at Westfield -- will be put up about the 1st. Apr. Price $800. Mr. Brown has been taken up for selling liquor, -- but the fact could not be proved against him, as the witnesses would not own that they paid any thing for the liquor each testified that they had drank liquor there but did not pay for it. (A generous man this Mr. Brown) I suppose the house is bad very bad liquor drinking & gambling are not its only evils. The White boys close their school this week, -- they have succeeded well. Sanford Cook did not do so well -- left one week before he should have closed. Sam'l Mann is at home this winter speaks of leading a different -- and better life. Lewis &  Doct.Taylor's case has not come to trial yet, not much said about it. Think ? upon the subject you wished our opinion.

I have come in contact with some curious minds who contend that God is the author of all evil, and consequently answerable for all evil and blamable for all blame.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":42982,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/42982","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/fd41436640fc0383863a4df12e705dcf.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/fd41436640fc0383863a4df12e705dcf.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/fd41436640fc0383863a4df12e705dcf.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/fd41436640fc0383863a4df12e705dcf.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T16:10:35+00:00","modified":"2020-04-19T20:09:32+00:00","filename":"fd41436640fc0383863a4df12e705dcf.jpg","authentication":"c56f1f290cc8b7f68a436da1e72d388b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_093_008_003_o2.jpg","size":1468015,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2788,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048754417078485},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["045801"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["045801"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["045801"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"fd41436640fc0383863a4df12e705dcf.jpg","FileDateTime":1509466152,"FileSize":1468015,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2788\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2788,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:09 13:49:54","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 04:58:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 04:58:01","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":29,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2889,"ExifImageLength":3730,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":187,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/187","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"And say they man is the creature of circumstance made so by the stubborn decree of God and as a consequence free from all responsibility and exempt from all accountability whatever But such lose sight of the fact (or never saw it) that all, in every condition or circumstance in life, enjoy vastly more than they suffer.

I wish to be frank and say, that I hope you embrace and intend to advocate what is nearer Christianity, than the system taught at Cambridge. The idea however, of your going there may be a mistake and I conveniently hope it is. For my part. There is but one view of Christianity and but one commission as a minister, and that the Evangelical one, which, it seems to me, can ever justify the Choice of ministry as a profession; and if that be not correct, I would never undertake preaching as a profession.  After entering the work of the ministry, one will look upon it differently than before, and I think no man can find motive to discharge the duties of the ministry. faithfully and perseveringly, without misgiving for having commenced unless he finds it in the necessity of the gospel to save the soul.

I have planted it in a pot, and shall keep it in the house this winter: it is growing now, it will remind ,e of you and your sister.\n\n   Cophas Williard came near losing his life while stoning a well for Arkmas Bryant, week before last: from some carelessness a large quantity of stone fell in upon him, one struck the back part of his head knocking him down cutting a deep gash, he did not show signs of life for some time has not recovered his senses fully yet but is slowly recovering  so far as I know. The new liquor law works well throughout the State. Dr. Taylor has been very angry with Lewis Sanderson for saying what every body else says that he loves brandy to well. The Doct. has threatened to sue for defamation. I had thought of speaking to you about it in my last but supposed nothing more would be done - I would let it rest. It seems to have broken out anew, and a suit seems more certain. Lewis is Chairman of the Temperance Committee and quite decided in having the law enforced. The same day we called on Mr. Brown the Taverner, I saw him at Mr. Andrews shop when Brown said Doct. Taylor sends patients to me for spirituous liquor, L. told him not to mind Doct. T. for he liked Brandy himself and it was reported that he sometimes had to take a nap before administering medicine, a few such like things he spoke as report. Brown spoke of it to Wetherell who set the Doct. all on fire, he has raved and tore been to Fitchburg twice to see lawyer Wood, what it will all amount to time alone will develop. Brown was excited because he could not sell rum Wetherell no less so and has been urging Taylor on. There are various reports of damages the higher $10,000 the lower $1,000. I hope there will not be a suit. Mrs. Holman asks her to be excused from writing this time more than copying the poetry she sends you. Much love to yourself and Sister.

I wrote to Dr. Regimir when I was on my way past that I was almost entirely discouraged and asked for for directions from the directors, but received none, and on my arrival home found none but I had received a promise from Mr. Waggoner of Tiffin, Seneca Co. that if I would make a visit the he would use his influence in raising funds for the school, and with high anticipations I started a journey of 150 miles expressly to see what I could do. But you can imagine my disappointment when I arrived and found him all carried away with \"Spiritual Manifestations\" and so completely soured with Gurley and others who had written against it, was he, that I could not get a dollar from him nor anyone else in all that region. He is immensely rich and so are others whom he mentioned, but they all turned immortal Rappers and the spirits have told them, as they allege, that they must keep all their funds to build a Spiritual Temple, and brother Geo. R. Brown is to be their leader. Of all the disappointments I have met with, and they have been continually accumulating, this was the severest. I am your fraternally T.E. Eaton To N.

I have but nine scholars - I teach six hours in a day and the remainder of the time - I devote to my own studies. One of my scholars has been attending a school at Mt. Pleasant. He is receiving grammar and arithmetick and contemplates taking up history and probably physiology in a few days. I had in the parsing class such a phrase as this to come upon an  auxiliary verb with and imperfect participle. I want to know your opinion about it. In the Latin as \"was laboring\" we parse it as a verb in the imperfect tense. Again.

The greatest difficulty at this time would be suitable buildings, for the seminary has but two rooms and not as large as I would wish. I do not know what branches your sister teaches, But if she would be willing to reside 5 or 6 mo distant for 1 session in charge of a school in a pleasant family and good neighborhood we might in the mean time induce our people to act in erecting an addition to our Seminary building.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43046,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43046","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/86d3d6411270145c05713ae4af6fafa4.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/86d3d6411270145c05713ae4af6fafa4.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/86d3d6411270145c05713ae4af6fafa4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/86d3d6411270145c05713ae4af6fafa4.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T16:14:09+00:00","modified":"2020-05-23T07:04:35+00:00","filename":"86d3d6411270145c05713ae4af6fafa4.jpg","authentication":"9758fb939e70fbde974c7e1f6b31516f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_094_015_002_o2.jpg","size":1523341,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2931,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048123538926166},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["050708"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["050708"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["050708"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"86d3d6411270145c05713ae4af6fafa4.jpg","FileDateTime":1509466155,"FileSize":1523341,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2931\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2931,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:09 13:52:44","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 05:07:08","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 05:07:08","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2989,"ExifImageLength":3670,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":187,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/187","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I have not had time to consult with my friends on the subject, but believe they might be stimulated to do something. \nI can only add that my present session will terminate on the 20th Feby next, and if you will join me I will divide my school with you & we will make an effort to establish such a school as will draw the patronage of the county to it.

I would be very glad to see the Institute flourish and sent my children there last year to assist in encouraging the same - but owing to some things that took place in Marietta my Son became completely discouraged and disheartened with every thing about him and during that year did not learn as much as he had learned in 3 months in a country school -  since he has returned home he goes to school study esccepting such time as I have hard work for him which I place him at with a view to induce him to wish to go back to Marietta - and I also reason with him on the importance of education - but he would rather work hard than return but would be wiling to go any other place - My daughter I could reason with to return providing her brother was willing - but not alone- and to force my children to go so much against their inclination I think would be folly to espect them to make any improvement -

I have been waiting to communicate what I am very much interested in, and I know you are not indifferent. So, the time has come when my anxiety is changed to joy. Yesterday afternoon I became the father of a strong, healthy, robust boy. I trust we are truly thankful to our heavenly Father this precious gift, new emotions are awakened which none but parents can know. Thanks to cold water treatment Mrs. H was saved from a world of suffering in the hour of trial and is now very comfortable. I took care of her and the dear boy last night and am doing the same to-night. I trust we shall have wisdom and understanding to rear this our dear child aright. In the rearing of a child we seem to be living for something beside our own self. I have held the loved little one in my arms and tried to look down the stream of time when he shall arrive at manhood, and thought how much depends upon his training whether he shall be a blessing or curse to his race.

I am not very well acquainted with the history of  Universalism, but it seem to me there ought to be more Schools to prepare young men for the ministry- to prepare them aright- giving them a thorough Classical and Theological education, thus enabling them to meet and effectually refute Partialism whenver they Come in contact. If the Advocates of my faith are not well educated, and in every way well calculated, to defend its principles must necessarily suffer. The Universalists more especially have need of education in order that they may wholly eradicate every vestige of the traditionary teachings of Partialism, and inculcate into them the glorious truths of the Bible.

I waited some time, hoping I could get a favorable answer in reference to the boarding of my daughter when you Boarded, but receiving no intelligence I wrote to Mrs. Mixer to See if She would take her. (I had heard that Mrs. Boothe was full of Boarders) and felt verry sorry that She could not accommodate us.  I thought if any body was Entitled to any favor of that kind We certainly were.  It is not my nature to complain, but really it cast a more dense Cloud over my Spirits that had already Seemed low down, because of misfortune through which I had passed and hundreds of disappts.  I had met with while trying to keep up the Institute and promoted its best interests. But let that pass.\nIn answer to your inquiry about the propriety of Being Ordained before you receive letters of fellowship. I consider it would be perfectly proper to do so if there is nothing Expressly to prohibit it in the constitution of the Washington Association. And I do not know as there is. Or if you wished to go out under Unitarian colors it might be proper even if there was a prohibition in that Association. (I suppose that is the Job!!) I do not know certainly as I will be there, because if you are ordained and Mr. W. from Wheeling can be present - there will be Enough to form a Quorum and transact the duties of the occasion. And if you are ordained (if you are careful to get your License)  you can do the interesting Job. Mr. Weaver Engaged me to perform last (Dec.) month, not knowing then that you purposed to be ordained.\nAnd Especially as I had promised to be in Madison the next Sunday following unless I recall the appt. I could not be there. Beside I wished to go down with my own conveyance and transact some very important business for the Institute on the way.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43074,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43074","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/692ba1f8b891d14dfa329d067994f632.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/692ba1f8b891d14dfa329d067994f632.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/692ba1f8b891d14dfa329d067994f632.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/692ba1f8b891d14dfa329d067994f632.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T16:15:37+00:00","modified":"2020-05-23T07:20:34+00:00","filename":"692ba1f8b891d14dfa329d067994f632.jpg","authentication":"d3df4f2b73964baa0a180833b6228d59","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_095_008_002_o2.jpg","size":1630628,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2870,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.052607691315008},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["051029"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["051029"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["051029"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"692ba1f8b891d14dfa329d067994f632.jpg","FileDateTime":1509466156,"FileSize":1630628,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2870\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2870,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:09 13:54:00","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 05:10:29","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 05:10:29","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":66,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2953,"ExifImageLength":3703,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":187,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/187","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"And I want to do it in the month of Feb. or I fear I cannot do it at all.

February 8. 1853\n\nDear Bro Kendall\n\n                              I write immediately upon the reception of yours informing me that all obstacles are removed from between the junction of our hours, to say that I shall be with you on the evening of the 19th or of the 18th if there should be any risk or if I feel the need of a day's greeting & rest before the day's labor before me. For I intend preaching three times: or if the people think best, I will deliver my Daniel Webster sermon in the body of A day. I have such a sermon. This prepared with much care & toil. I preached it to my own people. It is published in pamphlet & I should have sent my Marietta friends some complimentary copies, had it not been that I meditated an exchange with Bro Bartlett & was just about writing him when I rec'd your first note.

I have come to this conclusion, that duty to my family demands that I place my children in a situation where they can avail themselves of the advantages of a good School. I think this object would be served by a residence on your town. Several of the brethren with whom I have conversed have also expressed the opinion, that I could render myself highly useful in that field of labor.\n Under these circumstances, I am induced to say, if my services are desired, I will go to Marietta on the conditions mentioned, VIZ seven hundred dollars salary.

My first select school, was the pleasantest school I have ever taught. Perhaps one great reason for this was, that I found myself much relieved by a division of labor. After the close of my winter school, I found myself more inclined than ever, to make teaching a profession; and, in order to fit myself, the more ably to perform the duties of this office, I decided to pursue my studies during the summer at the N.E. Normal Institute. This school is one which was established last spring, in the beautiful town of Lancaster, under the direction of Professor Mr. Russell, and the patronage of the town. Differing from other normal schools of the commonwealth, it has no assistance from the state. It has for its chief object the fitting of teachers for High and Grammar schools, although none are restricted to a particular course of study. It is arranged as a school of departments each under the care of a separate principal instructor and assistants Proff. Russell, Principal of the Rhetorical and Elocutionary departments, Dana P. Colburn, Prin. of Math. Department; William I. Whitaker, Prin. Department of Drawing, Painting etc. Beside these, there is a Foreign teacher","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43133,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43133","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/af9d71502342f39d4d5fb6b55c08dd98.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/af9d71502342f39d4d5fb6b55c08dd98.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/af9d71502342f39d4d5fb6b55c08dd98.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/af9d71502342f39d4d5fb6b55c08dd98.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T16:18:40+00:00","modified":"2020-04-26T19:44:39+00:00","filename":"af9d71502342f39d4d5fb6b55c08dd98.jpg","authentication":"f11bb6a822b990bb7a1e0b19053c8a25","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_096_012_003_o2.jpg","size":1429314,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2860,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046274087024087},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["051734"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["051734"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["051734"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"af9d71502342f39d4d5fb6b55c08dd98.jpg","FileDateTime":1509466158,"FileSize":1429314,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2860\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2860,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:09 13:56:38","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 05:17:34","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 05:17:34","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":8,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2942,"ExifImageLength":3702,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":187,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/187","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"in French, German & Italian; one of Music; one in the Classical department; one in Penmanship; etc. etc.\n\n            Every department is conducted in a manner calculated to give the student a thorough knowledge of principles, with strenuously avoiding the superficial mode of teaching, so common in Academies.\n     Since I have been there, the question whether I should ever be satisfied, if I did not take a collegiate course, has come home to my mind, appealing more earnestly for an affirmative answer than ever before.

I spent a very pleasant evening with her in talking over old times.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43157,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/43157","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c23e1ebb2dadacd61d53f8e058dab992.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c23e1ebb2dadacd61d53f8e058dab992.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c23e1ebb2dadacd61d53f8e058dab992.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c23e1ebb2dadacd61d53f8e058dab992.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T16:20:11+00:00","modified":"2020-05-23T08:04:02+00:00","filename":"c23e1ebb2dadacd61d53f8e058dab992.jpg","authentication":"66b32a43323d04fc675ea522a501a240","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_04_fl_096_021_004_o2.jpg","size":1478929,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2992,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.045768004802931},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["052020"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["052020"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170808"],"TimeCreated":["052020"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c23e1ebb2dadacd61d53f8e058dab992.jpg","FileDateTime":1509466159,"FileSize":1478929,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2992\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2992,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:09 13:57:49","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:08 05:20:20","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:08 05:20:20","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":7,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2524,"ExifImageLength":3036,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":187,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/187","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I heard Br. Williamson, twice while I was in the city. I liked his sermon very much. I have read some of his writings but never heard him before. He is a pastor of the First Society now. They have a splendid church, but it appears to me there is a sort of an aristocratic air around one when they seat themselves in the congregation. Perhaps it is because I am a \"country girl\". But I do not feel so much at home as I do at the Second Church.\n\n       You spoke of learning a Swedenborgian  minister preach. Did you ever hear Mr. Giles of ? I have heard him spoken of very often there. He preached a funeral sermon in our village, not long since & I wished very much to go, but Aunt was going, so I remained at home with the children. She was very much pleased with some parts of his discourse, but like many others whom I have heard speak of them, thought there were a good many absurdities. I think I will go & hear him if I stay in the city over Sabbath. But I wish to hear Mr. Livingston, who I heard you speak of & I do not know whether I can go both places.\n Our Sabbath School has closed for the Winter, the weather being bad & so many of the scholars living at a distance. They have taken pieces for another exhibition, which we expect to have between Christmas & New Year. Can't you come & spend the holidays with us and attend it? We should like to have you come very much.  Uncle Henry has just returned from a visit-East and is very well. The person of our name on the Arctic was no relative. Wasn'nt  - that  shocking? Do you take the Gospel Herald? Did you see that sermon of Henry W. Bucher's on the loss of the Arctic? I liked it so much.

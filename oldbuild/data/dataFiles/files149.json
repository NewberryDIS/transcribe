Oct 23rd\n     ( Aunt? )\n\nMy Dear Jane\n\n   I have waited patiently for this letter but I see no signs of it yet but I am in hopes you will not forget it\n\nI am here at the old school house again this is the third week of the winter term my school is much smaller now than it was in the summer and I am very glad of it for I can have a better school\n\n  Elizabeth Roberts commenced a select school last week in Pres Roberts old tea shop that building that is nearly opposite P.W. Roberts lawn she has over twenty scholars and they were most all my scholars but I have over forty scholars yet\n  Laura is quite sick the Doctor says that she has the congestive fever she is very much as she was before the time she had bleeding at the lungs only not as bad but the Doctor says she is not dangerous although it will be some time before she gets well.\n  The rest of us are quite well. Richard was home he went off this morning the first he has been home since the big meeting Kate is going to continue her school till January if not longer Your Brother Louis has been at New York he came home last week and looks better than I have seen him before this summer he works at the office now. \n  Sarah's health is improving too she sat up about ten minutes Sunday and she has walked as far as the door of the study Dr. Guiteau says that she has a long life before her yet and not only tells her so but others and I hope he is a good prophet in that case","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":34861,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/34861","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/c0a0486e131cc7aa5944416be10cadef.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/c0a0486e131cc7aa5944416be10cadef.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/c0a0486e131cc7aa5944416be10cadef.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c0a0486e131cc7aa5944416be10cadef.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T16:52:06+00:00","modified":"2020-12-11T19:19:26+00:00","filename":"c0a0486e131cc7aa5944416be10cadef.jpg","authentication":"28738181b132202ba92c9a219e137513","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_05_fl_188_065_02_o2.jpg","size":1297157,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2889,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041573945873877},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["051025+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["051025+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["051025+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c0a0486e131cc7aa5944416be10cadef.jpg","FileDateTime":1507740655,"FileSize":1297157,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2889\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2889,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"13mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:21 14:05:22","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 05:10:25","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 05:10:25","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTime":63,"SubSecTimeOriginal":63,"SubSecTimeDigitized":63,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2151,"ExifImageLength":2680,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":149,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/149","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Mary is going Whiteboro and your mother is coming home this week and Mary says you should hear from her soon.\n\n I hope you will enjoy yourself and improve in knowledge and goodness I sorry for you if you are not satisfied but never mined it better days are yet to dawn.

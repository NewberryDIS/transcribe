I left Bangor a week ago last Monday | August 25th | in company with Eliab & his wife & daughter Anna. E came to Boston on business & to take care of us his wife went on to visit her friends at East Hampton & Anna went on her way to Westfield where she was to stop a day or to then to Ellyria to visit Mrs Hopkins 2 or 3 weeks & then to Chicago where she will doubtless engage in teaching with encouraging prospects of success & trust. It seems rather sad to me for her at her age to go way to far from home seeking her fortune.

Eliab had a letter from Uncle Pel. a few days ago they are all well as usual speaking of the weather brought it to my mind\n\nSam'l called here last monday eve on his way into the woods he has rather a hard time this winter tho he is making money perhaps - & perhaps not for he has to give enormous prices for what he buys. And labor is exceedingly scarce & high. It would seem that every body capable of swinging an ax is off in the woods John Hodgkins was in here said his Charles was going into the woods gets 12 dollars a month. Mr. Rider says that he shall want James as Ellridge is in the woods and Mills is going to Foxcroft to school but that he must stay if we cant get somebody else. I ask'd Mr. H. about George who is now at Hector Sargents he said if Mrs. S. did not conclude to hire him he might come here till Spring opens for 7 dollars a month said he had rather he would work he than anywhere else but talks of taking him to old town with him bye & bye if he can get 12, a month. Said something about his working here all summer if you were going to be at home etc. I was talking with Mr. Livermore about the work here in the spring he is always full of business you know but said if you should have a stout yoke of oxen he should like to change work a good deal - by the way why dont you tell","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":97931,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/files\/97931","file_urls":{"original":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/original\/d0b010d940d68665542aef16c943bb48.jpg","fullsize":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/fullsize\/d0b010d940d68665542aef16c943bb48.jpg","thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/thumbnails\/d0b010d940d68665542aef16c943bb48.jpg","square_thumbnail":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d0b010d940d68665542aef16c943bb48.jpg"},"added":"2020-04-19T17:38:28+00:00","modified":"2020-08-15T11:16:17+00:00","filename":"d0b010d940d68665542aef16c943bb48.jpg","authentication":"c78977634c42ac3d349dbd444235d5a2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_metcalf_box_04_fl_83_002_002_o2.jpg","size":1755570,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2836,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.057317622629682},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["000335"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["000335"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180711"],"TimeCreated":["000335"],"City":["Yes"],"Credit":["821787"],"Source":["Midwest MS Metcalf Box 4"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d0b010d940d68665542aef16c943bb48.jpg","FileDateTime":1587317838,"FileSize":1755570,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2836\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2836,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2018 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:07:20 10:33:39","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.05,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:07:11 00:03:35","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:07:11 00:03:35","ShutterSpeedValue":4.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":37,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3426,"ExifImageLength":4348,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":1236,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/items\/1236","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"https:\/\/transcribe.newberry.org\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"at what time you expect to come home - whether you come before the the time for Spring work or not I suppose it would be well to get oxen.

I ask'd Charlie what I should write to you he says tell Faver he better come before we plant.

Do try your influence to stop the whole proceeding for a while in the hot weather\n We have all been almost sick with Colds. I had a very severe cold in the first of the winter. But had got over it & went to Bangor thinking to stay thro' the coldest of the weather. But came home because when Josie was sick he and baby have been sick enough to be very troublesome and require a great deal of care & attention but Charles need not be anxious about them we are being very careful and nursing them up nicely probably they'll be all well long before he'll know they have been unwell.

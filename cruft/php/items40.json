After spending most of her life in the small Midwestern towns where her husband's business took her and her daughter, at the end of her life she settled in Chicago, where she died in 1902. Catherwood was a central figure in Middle Western authorship during the 1880's and 1890's, writing historical romances, both short stories and novels. Many of her regional, local-color tales reflect life in the corn-belt towns of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, as well as the French traditions along the American-Canadian border. Yet she also employed historical settings such as Colonial Arcadia and nineteenth century Mackinac Island. Both well-educated and ambitious, Catherwood had a successful writing career, publishing consistently in magazines of the period, such as Lippincott's Magazine, Harper's Magazine and Atlantic Monthly, as well as in several periodicals for young people. The popularity of Catherwood's sentimental, romantic style and subject matter waned with the advent of a new realism in literature after the turn of the twentieth century, but her regional short stories are of interest for their rich local color and details of speech, manners, emotions and incidents of the times. <a href=\"https:\/\/mms.newberry.org\/xml\/xml_files\/Catherwood.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<\/a> | <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/mms_catherwood_box_001\/page\/n425\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View in digital collection<\/a>","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":41,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/41","name":"Description","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"To transcribe","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"3","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":55,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/55","name":"Percent Completed","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"97","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":54,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/54","name":"Percent Needs Review","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"100003","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":56,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/56","name":"Weight","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/0805dc399bf4c515757089914f98b383.jpg","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":48,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/48","name":"Source","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}

I was also told that he\nhad been an useful man in calming, as far as\nthe great influence he possessed allowed, the storms\nboth of religious controversy, & of political animosity.\nIt must be remembered that a clergyman of Mr.\nBeecher's energy & talents, has much more prominence\nand influence in America, where there is no governing\nclass, than it would be possible for him to attain in England.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":58864,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/58864","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/efd355c9ab5ee55b7121acdc53f7b057.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/efd355c9ab5ee55b7121acdc53f7b057.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/efd355c9ab5ee55b7121acdc53f7b057.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/efd355c9ab5ee55b7121acdc53f7b057.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-15T16:35:24+00:00","modified":"2019-10-20T20:35:29+00:00","filename":"efd355c9ab5ee55b7121acdc53f7b057.jpg","authentication":"22798b89f0da44801e879bded42fd431","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":32,"original_filename":"GR_4799_0022_o2.jpg","size":783234,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1872,"resolution_y":2293,"compression_ratio":0.060821955337873},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"efd355c9ab5ee55b7121acdc53f7b057.jpg","FileDateTime":1521131694,"FileSize":783234,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1872\" height=\"2293\"","Height":2293,"Width":1872,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2293,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:15 09:55:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":236},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":386,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":10424},"EXIF":{"ExifVersion":221,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1872,"ExifImageLength":2293}}}},"item":{"id":943,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/943","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"29\nthe following portion has been X'd out:\nAn English Merchant, carrying on his business at\nNew York, and who had for several years been the\nPresident of the St. George's Society of that City, and in that\ncapacity brought very much into contact with the English\nmigrants, assured me that he had often had to blush for\nthe ignorance & helplessness of his countrymen.  \"Of all\nthe Immigrants,\" he said, \"who came to the United States, the\nEnglishman was the least educated, & so the most shiftless\neven? the wild Irishman had generally been better taught\nand knew more.\"\nend of X'd out portion\n\n      There is a club, perhaps we should call it a Society\n\nor association, of Episcopalian Broad Churchmen, the\nmembers of which reside in the cities of New York and\nPhiladelphia.

Most of the men, too, being\nyoung Farmers, or sons of Farmers had been accustomed to felling\ntimber, & working on the land, so that every regiment was full\nof ready made pioneers.\n\n      Another advantage possessed in a preeminent degree by the Northern\n\nArmies, was that their soldiers having been drawn equally from all classes\nand trades, if a corps of wheelwrights, millwrights, harness-makers, or\nalmost for any thing else required in the field, was suddenly wanted, it\nwas always to be had ready made at a moment's notice.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":58922,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/58922","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/1774adc3b59e73f0c60eaeff55037d03.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/1774adc3b59e73f0c60eaeff55037d03.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/1774adc3b59e73f0c60eaeff55037d03.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1774adc3b59e73f0c60eaeff55037d03.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-15T16:36:11+00:00","modified":"2019-10-20T20:35:29+00:00","filename":"1774adc3b59e73f0c60eaeff55037d03.jpg","authentication":"3acff8da76273b73f3fd23f8b3992e34","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":90,"original_filename":"GR_4799_0055_o2 copy.jpg","size":615413,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1872,"resolution_y":2293,"compression_ratio":0.047789832923937},"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1774adc3b59e73f0c60eaeff55037d03.jpg","FileDateTime":1521131696,"FileSize":615413,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1872\" height=\"2293\"","Height":2293,"Width":1872,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2293,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:15 09:56:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":236},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":386,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6703},"EXIF":{"ExifVersion":221,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1872,"ExifImageLength":2293}}}},"item":{"id":943,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/943","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"87\n\n   On passing over these battle-fields one quickly understands\n\nwhy in the late war cavalry was so little used for improving\na victory; & why also the attacking army generally appeared\nto have so great an advantage.

They speak, too, more frequently, & with more regard\nof the old country, its people, & its institutions.  Everybody I saw in the\nChurches in Richmond just as in the Churches of the northern cities was \nwell-dressed.  The humbler classes appeared neither to have churches for themselves\nnor places in the churches of the rich.  This, as everybody knows, is the\nweak point in the American voluntary system.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":58947,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/58947","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/abfabd4925f6f57033798287d303d7bf.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/abfabd4925f6f57033798287d303d7bf.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/abfabd4925f6f57033798287d303d7bf.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/abfabd4925f6f57033798287d303d7bf.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-15T16:36:31+00:00","modified":"2019-10-20T20:35:29+00:00","filename":"abfabd4925f6f57033798287d303d7bf.jpg","authentication":"b363ba7e36e4f68f17cfa6a8ffe41756","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":115,"original_filename":"GR_4799_0068_o2.jpg","size":721328,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

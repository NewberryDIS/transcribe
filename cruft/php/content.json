In 1841 and 1842, teenager Mary Sackett kept a lively, detailed journal of the journey from New York City to Laona, a small town in Winnebago County, Illinois. In 1847, when Mary Sackett was twenty-one, she married Hanson C. Pierson, who died a year later. In 1852 she married Samuel Chapman with whom she had six children. Little else is known about Sackett\u2019s adult life, and she died at age forty-three in 1869.

He graduated from Wrexham Seminary in 1815, and soon after was ordained a minister with the Congregationalists at Capel L\u00f4n Swan, Denbigh. During this time Everett learned a system of shorthand writing, which he adapted to the Welsh language and continued to use throughout his life. While at Denbigh he wrote an instructional book of this shorthand writing, as well as a Sunday school catechism first published in 1822. He married Elizabeth Roberts, of Denbigh, in 1816, and the couple emigrated to America in 1823 when Everett accepted a call to the Welsh Congregational Church of Utica, NY. He remained in Utica nine years, then moved south to Winfield to become pastor of the Congregational Church there, and also spent a short time as pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Westernville. In 1838 he settled in Steuben, near Remsen, NY, where he took charge of the two Welsh chapels there, Capel Ucha and Penymynydd. Everett continued as pastor in Steuben until his death in 1875. Included here are sermons delivered between 1800 and 1860. Note that the early sermons were most likely not written by Everett, but probably revised and delivered by him. <a href=\"https:\/\/mms.newberry.org\/xml\/xml_files\/Everett.xml#sum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<\/a>","lang":"","image":"","pc":"5","pnr":"6","weight":"010095","needsreview":11,"incomplete":0,"complete":10,"count":200,"calc_needsrev":5.5,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":5},{"id":"142","name":"Robert Everett sermons and writings, 1794-1860s Pt. 3","startDate":"1794","endDate":"1860","subjects":["Rowley family","Families","Farm life","Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

John and Sarah emigrated to Kansas Territory in 1854, and the letters detail the hardships of pioneer life as well as the violent and chaotic environment created by anti-slavery and pro-slavery forces fighting over the territory's status. An abolitionist, John Roberts Everett was active in the the Free Soil movement during his time in Kansas, and present with John Brown at the Battle of Osawatomie on August 30, 1856.

Included are the couple's courtship letters as well as correspondence during later separations when one or the other of them was traveling, and a collection of their small diaries. There is correspondence and a few transcriptions of the narration of Charles Reed (Abby J. Reed's brother) concerning his 1849 overland journey to California and his subsequent adventures with the Washington City and California Mining Association, his prospecting on the Feather River and near Downieville, and his 1854 survival of a shipwreck off the California coast. News of close friends who took the Panama route to California is also included in the correspondence of Agnes Allen.

Jacobs, an attorney of Greeley, Colorado, consisting mainly of letters to him from Clarence Darrow. Written between 1909 and 1926, the letters provide documentation of friendship, professional collaboration, and a shared interest in reading. They also demonstrate the famous lawyer's concern and affection for his only child, Paul, who was living in Greeley as the manager of the Greeley Gas and Fuel Company. Subjects include the case of Stewart v. Ramsay; some allusions to Darrow's legal role in the Los Angeles bombing case and his bribery indictment; recommended reading and opinions on philosophical and psychological books; Darrow's desire to rent and\/or own a cottage in Estes Park, Colorado; money and investments, and above all, Paul's welfare. <a href=\"https:\/\/mms.newberry.org\/xml\/xml_files\/JacobsDarrow.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View catalog guide<\/a>","lang":"","image":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/a761f1a83b8a28788f634f22bb55f423.jpg","pc":"58","pnr":"21","weight":"079079","needsreview":8,"incomplete":0,"complete":22,"count":38,"calc_needsrev":21.052631578947366,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":57.89473684210527},{"id":"200","name":"Elbert Ozial Taylor writings, undated\r\n","startDate":null,"endDate":null,"subjects":["Rowley family","Families","Farm life","Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

However, the miscellaneous documents in the second series do extend to the late 1880s and early 1890s and therefore include some advertisements (in the form of a broadside and handbills) of his temperance lectures, as well as a letter from the Prohibitionist Samuel D. Hastings. <a href=\"https:\/\/mms.newberry.org\/xml\/xml_files\/TaylorE.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<\/a>","lang":"","image":"","pc":"","pnr":"","weight":"","needsreview":0,"incomplete":0,"complete":0,"count":216,"calc_needsrev":0,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":0},{"id":"208","name":"T-Bone Slim writings, 1934-1942\r\n","startDate":"1934","endDate":"1942","subjects":["Rowley family","Families","Farm life","Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

His father was a well-known abolitionist who was later nominated as the first vice presidential candidate for the Liberty Party. In 1876, Francis J. LeMoyne erected the first crematorium in the United States near Washington, Pennsylvania. John LeMoyne studied law in Pittsburgh and was admitted to the bar in 1852.

The letters touch on many subjects that concerned typical Americans during World War I, the 1920s and then the Depression, such as the shortages and hardships, the influenza epidemic, the League of Nations, Prohibition, Hoover\u2019s presidency, labor strikes, and so on. Daland offers much advice to Gerard, who was always in need of money and clothes, and to her daughter who was becoming an unsuccessful artist.

By 1912 she was singing important roles in Die Walkyrie in German, The Barber of Seville and The Jewels of the Madonna in Italian, and The Tales of Hoffmann in English. A native of Alsace-Lorraine, Dufau had arrived on the Chicago musical scene in 1910 following studies in Berlin, and almost immediately was successful with audiences. After 1916 she concentrated on a concert career, appearing at Ravinia and in Hamilton Park concert series, in Orchestra Hall and in Boston, among other places. In May, 1916, she sang with the silent film The Law Decides, which was one of the latest of entertainments called \u201cCinema Concerts.\u201d In a 1917 recital at Orchestra Hall she sang La Marseillaise as apparently was the custom, followed by \u201can eclectic program\u201d of Russian, Swedish and French songs, along with new songs written for her by Frank LaForge. Dufau\u2019s name no longer appears in the Chicago papers after 1917, so presumably she returned to Europe at the end of the war.<br \/><br \/>This collection consists almost entirely of letters written to Jenny Dufau by an Italian lover named Gaetano Riccuilli from September 1915, to April 1917, while Dufau was performing with the Chicago Grand Opera Company. Most of these letters concern his family or hers, the events of his daily life, the fact of their separation due to the war, and his many moods. Ricciulli apparently was an active service army officer on disability leave at the time of these letters.<br \/><br \/>The principle historical interest of the letters lies in the many passing references to the war, especially to its disruption of civilian life in Italy, and to a lesser degree in France and Switzerland. There are repeated references to censorship, and the development of censorship is traceable by evidence on the envelopes. For a brief time after the start of censorship his letters become more circumspect, but they return to the passionate tone of the earlier ones fairly quickly. One letter speculates on the possibility that America may enter the war on the side of the Italian-French-English alliance. Except in a very general way, there is no information here on the progress of the war itself or of civilian morale, as these topics undoubtedly would have been censored. <a href=\"https:\/\/i-share.carli.illinois.edu\/nby\/cgi-bin\/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=808377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<\/a>\n<p><\/p>","lang":"Italian","image":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/2470ae3e27e127ba3b18873fd5412df5.jpg","pc":"","pnr":"1","weight":"001099","needsreview":1,"incomplete":0,"complete":0,"count":194,"calc_needsrev":0.5154639175257731,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":0},{"id":"219","name":"Hannah Hayden letters, 1806-1866","startDate":"1806","endDate":"1866","subjects":["Rowley family","Families","Farm life","Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

She had the skill to buy and rent houses and land, while she also traveled back to Bainbridge New York to be with her father. When he died, Augusta became active in the Suffrage Movement.<br \/><br \/>Mary Olivia Hurd married Daniel Clark Arno in 1884 and a long and difficult relationship began, as Mary Olivia\u2019s letters to her mother reveal. Dan Arno was quick-tempered and sometimes abusive. He was a skilled carpenter and builder of houses, often away from home, leaving Mary to cope with the hardships of rural life and isolated motherhood in or near Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Mary followed her mother\u2019s example of dealing in westward speculation, but a severe financial and agricultural depression kept profits low and farming was arduous. Mary\u2019s letters to her mother between 1886 and 1897 refer to her longing to be near her, and in 1898 Ann Augusta Hurd permanently left New York and settled with her daughter in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, in a home built by her son-in-law, Dan Arno. Augusta Hurd died in 1921 and Mary Hurd Arno died in 1925.<br \/><br \/>This collection is composed mainly of letters from Mary Olivia Hurd Arno to her mother, 1886-1897, with six letters of Augusta Jaquins Hurd to her father and brother, 1858-1866, and seventeen miscellaneous letters either to her or retained by her.<br \/><br \/>Note: This collection has been published; see <em>The Letters of Ann Augusta Jaquins Hurd and Mary Olivia Hurd Arno, 1858-1897<\/em>, edited by Helen Hazen Cooperman (Chicago: Cooperman, 1988). <a href=\"https:\/\/i-share.carli.illinois.edu\/nby\/cgi-bin\/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=808762\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<\/a>","lang":"","image":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c51fa106d35969ddb30cf35edfdee1a2.jpg","pc":"1","pnr":"19","weight":"020081","needsreview":54,"incomplete":0,"complete":4,"count":286,"calc_needsrev":18.88111888111888,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":1.3986013986013985},{"id":"223","name":"Parish family letters, 1884-1896","startDate":"1884","endDate":"1896","subjects":["Rowley family","Families","Farm life","Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

Hitz was a lifelong resident of Indianapolis, where he died in 1949. A graduate of Indiana University, Mr. Hitz was devoted to the intellectual and charitable institutions of his state, and throughout his life he was an avid collector of books and manuscripts, particularly of explorations of the Middle West and the works of Mary Webb and Willa Cather. His collection of Cather first editions and Cather-related correspondence was sold to the Newberry Library after his death. <br \/><br \/>Although born in Virginia in 1873, Willa Cather was transplanted to Nebraska when she was nine. Her life on the pioneering frontier of the Great Plains made a lasting impression on her, shaping her talent and interests as she became familiar with the struggles for survival of the immigrant farm families she came to know. Her observations and the kinship she felt for the new Americans of Nebraska was later reflected in much of her fiction, notably in two of her best-known novels, O Pioneers (1913) and My Antonia (1918). <br \/><br \/>Cather graduated from the University of Nebraska in 1895 and began a career first as a teacher and then as a magazine editor, finally settling in New York City in 1906 as editor of McClure's Magazine. During these years she traveled a good deal, developing a special affection both for France and the American Southwest - the latter described lovingly in the novel Death Comes for the Archbishop - and in 1912 she decided to concentrate on supporting herself as a free-lance writer. What followed was a life dedicated to writing, one in which she published twelve novels and fifty-eight short stories that brought her much popularity and numerous honors and prizes. <br \/><br \/>Willa Cather, generally regarded as one of the twentieth century's major American writers, died in New York in 1947. <a href=\"https:\/\/mms.newberry.org\/xml\/xml_files\/HitzCather.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<\/a>","lang":"","image":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7816952ce2c2980f01ad41c5380a276f.jpg","pc":"28","pnr":"","weight":"028100","needsreview":0,"incomplete":0,"complete":32,"count":114,"calc_needsrev":0,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":28.07017543859649},{"id":"828","name":"Willa Cather - Irene Miner Weisz Papers, 1912-1958","startDate":"1912","endDate":"1958","subjects":["Rowley family","Families","Farm life","Letters (Correspondence); Edward E.

Among other activities the Miner girls and Cather put on plays to entertain friends and families, and as the years passed they remained friends and correspondents. Irene Miner married Charles W. Weisz and spent her adult life in Chicago. <br \/><br \/>Although Willa Cather was born in Virginia, in 1883 when she was 9, her father moved the family to Nebraska. This transition from the orderly South to the pioneering frontier of the Great Plains made a lasting impression on her and in her cultured but rather tomboyish youth she observed and became familiar with immigrant farm families struggling to conquer a sometimes hostile environment. The kinship she felt for the new Americans of Nebraska was later reflected in much of her fiction, notably in two of her best-known novels, O Pioneers!

Some of these, as with the Miner sisters dating from her early life in Red Cloud, Nebraska, lasted all her life.

It contains descriptions of food shortages, wagon travel across mountain ranges, and gold rush Sacramento and San Francisco. The journal of the 1851 voyage from San Francisco to New York describes hardships of travel on the recently inaugurated Nicaragua route via San Juan and Greytown, and an Atlantic voyage plagued by an inexperienced captain, coal and food shortages, and a massive storm. Journals of the 1854 voyages to and from San Francisco describe the Isthmus of Panama route and an encounter with Santa Anna's fleet, which was blockading the Acapulco harbor. <a href=\"https:\/\/webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu\/nby\/cgi-bin\/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=141142\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View catalog record<\/a>","lang":"","image":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/992a7601c4ac50f1117e1d41a58cc0fa.jpg","pc":"2","pnr":"3","weight":"005097","needsreview":0,"incomplete":0,"complete":0,"count":140,"calc_needsrev":0,"calc_incomplete":0,"calc_complete":0},{"id":"1047","name":"Creek Indians discussion between Alabama governor Clement C.

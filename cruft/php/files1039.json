The war chief is kind to the Red skins but his duties will always be performed, he will have my aid and support to carry into effect his instructions from your Great Father -   You have good and evil before you and the choice is left to yourselves --  I have always been the friend of the Winnebagoes - I have never deceived them.  I have held you strong by the hand, but if you refuse to comply  with the wished of the President of the United States, as expressed by his War chief all good men will be opposed to you and will unite to compel you to do right. -  Let no evil advisers or bad men advise you to do wrong - do right that you may have a smoth road to travel and a clear sky to sleep under that the Great Spirit may be pleased with his red children the Winnebagoes.\n\n                                                                                            (Signed)  Henry Dodge.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":90648,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/90648","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/48c3486e75d1fdf7ffd105cab87f999f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/48c3486e75d1fdf7ffd105cab87f999f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/48c3486e75d1fdf7ffd105cab87f999f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/48c3486e75d1fdf7ffd105cab87f999f.jpg"},"added":"2019-10-31T16:44:39+00:00","modified":"2019-10-31T16:46:07+00:00","filename":"48c3486e75d1fdf7ffd105cab87f999f.jpg","authentication":"62eafb6e879d7e9c9c4230fa783e3d5d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_437_00001_o2.jpg","size":1489866,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2942,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046890059672181}},"item":{"id":1039,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1039","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[],"extended_resources":[]}]

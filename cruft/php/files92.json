  The twenty second of December has come at last, and I now hasten to fulfull my promise. I suppose you have got your letter written before this, for it is now evening, and I guess that you had time to write yours in the day time, did you not? I suppose you would like to know when my rec=itations come; well to begin with, my first one, which is Arithmetic ^for I must tell you that I am studying Arithmetic instead of Algebra^ is at nine, Astronomy at one, and Phisiology at three. Our Astronomy clafs is rather small; there are only seven in it; still it is very interesting; if you have ever studied it, you can perhaps imagine, how well I like it. Today has been the day for us to hand in our first compositions for this term; I had mine all written, but forgot to take it down, and so I shall have to carry it down tomorrow; you see it is not very easy for me to get off from that, anyway.

It is more than a week since I have heard from home.  I want very much to know what you think of the proposition -- made in my last letter.  I wish I could see some of you, so as to talk it over about the piano.  Perhaps you would think best for me to visit awhile to see how I get along teaching music before I get one.  What do you all think about it?  I should think you have had time enough to have some thoughts about it.  If you would only secret them to one in some shape, I should feel relieved.

There seems to be a prevailing desire manifested by most young people to spend their time in an unprofitable manner, it does not seem to arise from any thing of evil on their part but from a want of courage to break over the bounds which their associates have established, They cannot endure the sneers of their fellows, cannot support their (if I may so speak) by conversing in an intelligible manner for fear they will be sober.  As an excuse for not engaging in conversation people sometimes say that they {crossed out phrase: can find nothing} are not able to converse as well as other, if they are not they never wil be unless there is some effort on their part to become so. Though it requires some effort to do this yet the benefits which result more than recompense anyone for his trouble, his own personal happiness is greatly increased and he is able to accomplish a much greater amount of good than he otherwise could, for as he understand and those who listen cannot fail to comprehend what is meant without the trouble of trying to solve the puzzling enigmas in which those persons are obliged to express themselves who are not accustomed to expressing their ideas frequently. The great end and aim of all seems to be happiness and as the power to converse will greatly increase our happiness it is strange that there is not a greater effort made to secure this treasure. It is the duty of every one to do all the good in his power and as the power to converse will enable anyone to wield a greater influence than others he can cause greatly more good and it is manifest that he ought to cultivate these powers which have been given him. \nJ.C.

     J. C. Fledman\nAmbition is the desire of power; and when possessed by \nan individual causes him to try to excel.\nIt has truly been said that \"knowledge is power\" and governed\nby this hypothesis the ambitious person embraces every opportunity\nthat is presented, calculated to raise him to a higher \nstation or to increase his power; with a view to become\ngreat, to surpass others. He is very apt to attain the end for\nwhich he seeks in unclear of the untiring vigor with \nwhich he applies himself or if he do not attain it he will\nat least become a more intelligent and therefore useful member\nof society. This desire seems to be implanted in our natures\nby the unclear of our being, but is increased or diminished \naccording to the circumstances by which we are surrounded.\nIf not only characterizes individuals but nations and as \na general thing their prosperity is in proportion to the \ndegree of ambition which they possess. The great men\nof all ages were distinguished by this characteristic; if\nthey had not been they would never have reached the \nheighth of perfection which they did buy their names\nand discoveries would have remained in oblivion.\nBut ambition is not always a good thing for it is not\nalways rightly directed, as for instance when women talk\nof their public rights; as though they could not exert their\ninfluence to as good an effect in some other way than speaking\nin public.

The first journal, from 1851, describes the death of a family member, Aldric, who had gone to California (possibly Mrs. Rowley’s husband).

Frequent trips to Chicago and other nearby towns including Leyden, Ridgeland, Harlem, and Maywood are described, along with an extended trip to Mrs. Rowley’s childhood home of Shelburn (now Shelburne), Vermont.

        "description": "Mary Sackett was born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1825, the eldest of the living children of Isaac Sackett and his wife Mary Johnson. The family was living in Brooklyn, New York, when Isaac decided to move them to the Middle West, where his sister Abigail and her husband Charles Cleveland were already settled. In 1841 and 1842, teenager Mary Sackett kept a lively, detailed journal of the journey from New York City to Laona, a small town in Winnebago County, Illinois. In 1847, when Mary Sackett was twenty-one, she married Hanson C. Pierson, who died a year later. In 1852 she married Samuel Chapman with whom she had six children. Little else is known about Sackett’s adult life, and she died at age forty-three in 1869. This journal was kept by Mary Sackett when she and her family emigrated from New York state to Laona, Winnebago County, Illinois in 1841-1842. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Sackett.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a> | <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/mms_038\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View in digital collection</a>",

After spending most of her life in the small Midwestern towns where her husband's business took her and her daughter, at the end of her life she settled in Chicago, where she died in 1902. Catherwood was a central figure in Middle Western authorship during the 1880s and 1890s, writing historical romances, both short stories and novels. Many of her regional, local-color tales reflect life in the corn-belt towns of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, as well as the French traditions along the American-Canadian border. Yet she also employed historical settings such as Colonial Arcadia and 19th century Mackinac Island. Both well-educated and ambitious, Catherwood had a successful writing career, publishing consistently in magazines of the period, such as Lippincott's Magazine, Harper's Magazine and Atlantic Monthly, as well as in several periodicals for young people. The popularity of Catherwood's sentimental, romantic style and subject matter waned with the advent of a new realism in literature after the turn of the twentieth century, but her regional short stories are of interest for their rich local color and details of speech, manners, emotions and incidents of the times. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Catherwood.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a> | <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/mms_catherwood_box_001/page/n349\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View in digital collection</a>",

        "description": "Robert Everett was born in 1791, in Gronant, Flintshire, in northeast Wales. He graduated from Wrexham Seminary in 1815, and soon after was ordained a minister with the Congregationalists at Capel Lôn Swan, Denbigh. During this time Everett learned a system of shorthand writing, which he adapted to the Welsh language and continued to use throughout his life. While at Denbigh he wrote an instructional book of this shorthand writing, as well as a Sunday school catechism first published in 1822. He married Elizabeth Roberts, of Denbigh, in 1816, and the couple emigrated to America in 1823 when Everett accepted a call to the Welsh Congregational Church of Utica, NY. He remained in Utica nine years, then moved south to Winfield to become pastor of the Congregational Church there, and also spent a short time as pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Westernville.

Also born in Massachusetts in 1827, Abby Reed became a New England school teacher. Friendships among the members of the Kendall and Reed families led to the marriage of Nathan and Abby in 1857. By the end of the 1860s, the couple had acquired considerable agricultural land in Illinois and Indiana, so after losing his position as a superintendent for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and as a mill owner, Nathan hoped to find success as a farmer. Abby bore four sons: Edgar, Winthrop, George and Arthur, losing two other children in infancy. Farming proved to be a struggle, for Nathan's health was always poor and his lungs weak, and Abby felt the need for periodic trips back to Warwick, Mass. to visit her family - especially to see her sister Mary, who was her closest friend. Nathan Kendall died in 1871, just after he had decided that perhaps relocating in the South would help his lung disease. For the next few years Abby and the children lived in New England, renting out the Indiana farm, before returning to live permanently in the Middle West.

        "description": "Both from Massachusetts, Nathan Kendall and Abby J. Reed married in 1857 and raised a family of four sons, first in Indiana and later in Illinois.<br /><br />Nathan Kendall was born in 1824 and Abby J. Reed in 1927. Nathan served as principal in academies in Kentucky and New England before becoming a civil engineer in 1853 and moving to LaPorte, Indiana to work for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and then to own and operate a lumber mill. Abby Reed and her sister Mary were New England school teachers, and the friendships among the members of the Kendall and Reed families led to the marriage of Nathan and Abby in 1857.<br /><br />Nathan's first wife, Josephine Stedman, died in childbirth in 1854. As the Kendalls and Reed families were friends, Abby then began a correspondence with Nathan. They were married in 1857 and settled in LaPorte, Indiana and then in Kankakee, Illinois. By the end of the 1860s the couple had acquired considerable agricultural land in these two states, so after disappointment as a superintendent for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and as a mill owner, Nathan hoped to find success as a farmer. Abby bore four sons: Edgar, Winthrop, George and Arthur, losing two other children in infancy. Farming proved to be a struggle, for Nathan's health was always poor and his lungs weak, and Abby felt the need for periodic trips back to Warwick, Mass. to visit her family - especially to see her sister Mary, who was her closest friend.<br /><br />Nathan Kendall died in 1871, just after he had decided that perhaps relocating in the South would help his lung disease. For the next few years Abby and the children lived in New England, renting out the Indiana farm, before returning to live permanently in the Middle West. At the time of her death in 1912, Abby owned property in Fowler, Indiana and in Hudson, Massachusetts.<br /><br />This collection includes the correspondence, but also manuscripts and biographical notes, of Nathan Kendall, his wife, Abby J. Reed Kendall, and their immediate families and friends, dating primarily from the two decades preceding the Civil War. Included are the couple's courtship letters as well as correspondence during later separations when one or the other of them was traveling, and a collection of their small diaries. There is correspondence and a few transcriptions of the narration of Charles Reed (Abby J. Reed's brother) concerning his 1849 overland journey to California and his subsequent adventures with the Washington City and California Mining Association, his prospecting on the Feather River and near Downieville, and his 1854 survival of a shipwreck off the California coast. News of close friends who took the Panama route to California is also included in the correspondence of Agnes Allen. Also included are numerous schoolgirl essays. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/KendallReed.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

        "description": "Born in Massachusetts in 1824, Nathan Kendall served as principal in academies in Kentucky and New England before becoming a civil engineer in 1853 and moving to LaPorte, Indiana to work for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and then to own and operate a lumber mill. Also born in Massachusetts in 1827, Abby Reed became a New England school teacher. Friendships among the members of the Kendall and Reed families led to the marriage of Nathan and Abby in 1857. By the end of the 1860s, the couple had acquired considerable agricultural land in Illinois and Indiana, so after losing his position as a superintendent for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and as a mill owner, Nathan hoped to find success as a farmer. Abby bore four sons: Edgar, Winthrop, George and Arthur, losing two other children in infancy. Farming proved to be a struggle, for Nathan's health was always poor and his lungs weak, and Abby felt the need for periodic trips back to Warwick, Mass. to visit her family - especially to see her sister Mary, who was her closest friend. Nathan Kendall died in 1871, just after he had decided that perhaps relocating in the South would help his lung disease. For the next few years Abby and the children lived in New England, renting out the Indiana farm, before returning to live permanently in the Middle West. At the time of her death in 1912, Abby owned property in Fowler, Indiana and in Hudson, Massachusetts. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/KendallReed.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

Farming proved to be a struggle, for Nathan's health was always poor and his lungs weak, and Abby felt the need for periodic trips back to Warwick, Mass. to visit her family - especially to see her sister Mary, who was her closest friend. Nathan Kendall died in 1871, just after he had decided that perhaps relocating in the South would help his lung disease. For the next few years Abby and the children lived in New England, renting out the Indiana farm, before returning to live permanently in the Middle West. At the time of her death in 1912, Abby owned property in Fowler, Indiana and in Hudson, Massachusetts. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/KendallReed.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

The letters touch on many subjects that concerned typical Americans during World War I, the 1920s and then the Depression, such as the shortages and hardships, the influenza epidemic, the League of Nations, Prohibition, Hoover’s presidency, labor strikes, and so on. Daland offers much advice to Gerard, who was always in need of money and clothes, and to her daughter who was becoming an unsuccessful artist. Included in the collection is a fragment of a letter from Tucker Daland announcing Emily’s death in 1933 and three letters from Gerard to Daland. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Daland.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

        "description": "The daughter of Walter Loomis Newberry, the Chicago-based banker and real estate mogul whose bequest was used to found the Newberry Library in 1887, Julia Newberry rejected the comfortable but conventional life expected of her. Resisting the entreaties of men as illustrious as Colonel Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte, grandnephew of Napoleon I, Julia chose to follow her father’s advice: “‘<a href=\"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/scripto/transcribe/215/48360#transcription\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Be somebody, July.’ Papa always used to say, &amp; ‘be somebody’ I WILL. I’ve always been told I had plenty of brains, &amp; every natural advantage; so why shouldn’t I be Somebody???</a>” <br /><br />Yet the pace of her life exacerbated an underlying ailment, and in 1869 she fell seriously ill with an affliction assumed to be a “nervous” condition. Reporting the conclusion of her doctor, Julia writes that “<a href=\"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/scripto/transcribe/215/48436#transcription\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I am not allowed to read anything serious or have any kind of a lesson…I think I think the whole time &amp; that I cant help</a>.” Unsurprisingly, such cures proved ineffective, and Julia died in 1876. <a href=\"https://webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=574581\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View catalog record</a> | <a href=\"http://collections.carli.illinois.edu/cdm/ref/collection/nby_mms/id/40934\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View in digital collection</a>",

Calhoun, she had been a freelance art critic for Chicago newspapers as well as national publications. When her husband served as U.S. minister to China, she became the social leader of the diplomatic community in Peking.<br /><br />After her husband’s death, Lucy Calhoun served in the war effort in France in World War I. In the 1920’s she returned to Peking, established her home in an ancient temple, collected art, and become an “institution” in the city. She remained in Peking until the Japanese occupation of the city in 1937.Lucy Monroe Calhoun died in Chicago in 1950, aged 85.<br /><br />The collection includes six letters by Lucy Monroe Calhoun and three by husband William J. Calhoun (U.S.Minister to China, 1909-1913), regarding their experiences in China during the last years of the Qing Dynasty. One letter describes in detail the wedding of Emperor Puyi in December, 1922. A seventh letter relates Lucy Calhoun’s visit to LeMans, France, which served as an embarkation point for troops at the conclusion of World War I. <a href=\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=817922\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

        "description": "Jenny Dufau, a leading French soprano with the Chicago Grand Opera Company beginning in 1911, was described as the “smallest soprano” of the opera company. By 1912 she was singing important roles in Die Walkyrie in German, The Barber of Seville and The Jewels of the Madonna in Italian, and The Tales of Hoffmann in English. A native of Alsace-Lorraine, Dufau had arrived on the Chicago musical scene in 1910 following studies in Berlin, and almost immediately was successful with audiences. After 1916 she concentrated on a concert career, appearing at Ravinia and in Hamilton Park concert series, in Orchestra Hall and in Boston, among other places. In May, 1916, she sang with the silent film The Law Decides, which was one of the latest of entertainments called “Cinema Concerts.” In a 1917 recital at Orchestra Hall she sang La Marseillaise as apparently was the custom, followed by “an eclectic program” of Russian, Swedish and French songs, along with new songs written for her by Frank LaForge. Dufau’s name no longer appears in the Chicago papers after 1917, so presumably she returned to Europe at the end of the war.<br /><br />This collection consists almost entirely of letters written to Jenny Dufau by an Italian lover named Gaetano Riccuilli from September 1915, to April 1917, while Dufau was performing with the Chicago Grand Opera Company. Most of these letters concern his family or hers, the events of his daily life, the fact of their separation due to the war, and his many moods. Ricciulli apparently was an active service army officer on disability leave at the time of these letters.<br /><br />The principle historical interest of the letters lies in the many passing references to the war, especially to its disruption of civilian life in Italy, and to a lesser degree in France and Switzerland. There are repeated references to censorship, and the development of censorship is traceable by evidence on the envelopes. For a brief time after the start of censorship his letters become more circumspect, but they return to the passionate tone of the earlier ones fairly quickly. One letter speculates on the possibility that America may enter the war on the side of the Italian-French-English alliance. Except in a very general way, there is no information here on the progress of the war itself or of civilian morale, as these topics undoubtedly would have been censored. <a href=\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=808377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>\n<p></p>",

As several of her siblings moved westward into Wisconsin, she followed, and though she was trained to teach school she married Asa Hurd of Brandon, Wisconsin in 1859. The young Hurds bought land in Minnesota and attempted to become successful farmers.<br /><br />Augusta and Asa Hurd had one daughter born in 1862, whom they named Mary Olivia. Six and a half months later Asa joined the Union Army as a wagoner of Company E, 10th Minnesota Infantry and Augusta and her baby rejoined her sister in the more settled and stable town of Brandon, Wisconsin. Asa never returned from the war, having apparently been killed in April, 1865, outside Montgomery, Alabama, while foraging for his company, although there is some possibility he simply disappeared west as veterans sometimes did. Augusta never remarried. She supported herself and her daughter Mary by land speculation in Minnesota and South Dakota at a time when settlers were pouring into the Territories. She had the skill to buy and rent houses and land, while she also traveled back to Bainbridge New York to be with her father. When he died, Augusta became active in the Suffrage Movement.<br /><br />Mary Olivia Hurd married Daniel Clark Arno in 1884 and a long and difficult relationship began, as Mary Olivia’s letters to her mother reveal. Dan Arno was quick-tempered and sometimes abusive. He was a skilled carpenter and builder of houses, often away from home, leaving Mary to cope with the hardships of rural life and isolated motherhood in or near Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Mary followed her mother’s example of dealing in westward speculation, but a severe financial and agricultural depression kept profits low and farming was arduous. Mary’s letters to her mother between 1886 and 1897 refer to her longing to be near her, and in 1898 Ann Augusta Hurd permanently left New York and settled with her daughter in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, in a home built by her son-in-law, Dan Arno.

A graduate of Indiana University, Mr. Hitz was devoted to the intellectual and charitable institutions of his state, and throughout his life he was an avid collector of books and manuscripts, particularly of explorations of the Middle West and the works of Mary Webb and Willa Cather. His collection of Cather first editions and Cather-related correspondence was sold to the Newberry Library after his death. <br /><br />Although born in Virginia in 1873, Willa Cather was transplanted to Nebraska when she was nine. Her life on the pioneering frontier of the Great Plains made a lasting impression on her, shaping her talent and interests as she became familiar with the struggles for survival of the immigrant farm families she came to know.

Among other activities the Miner girls and Cather put on plays to entertain friends and families, and as the years passed they remained friends and correspondents. Irene Miner married Charles W. Weisz and spent her adult life in Chicago. <br /><br />Although Willa Cather was born in Virginia, in 1883 when she was 9, her father moved the family to Nebraska. This transition from the orderly South to the pioneering frontier of the Great Plains made a lasting impression on her and in her cultured but rather tomboyish youth she observed and became familiar with immigrant farm families struggling to conquer a sometimes hostile environment. The kinship she felt for the new Americans of Nebraska was later reflected in much of her fiction, notably in two of her best-known novels, O Pioneers! (1913) and My Antonia (1918). <br /><br />Cather graduated from the University of Nebraska in 1895 and began a career first as a teacher and then as a magazine editor, finally settling in New York City in 1906 as editor of McClure's Magazine.

Some of these, as with the Miner sisters dating from her early life in Red Cloud, Nebraska, lasted all her life. Though in her later years she suffered from bouts of poor health, writing remained her passion and she continued to publish, concluding with Saphira and the Slave Girl in 1940. <br /><br />Willa Cather, generally regarded as one of the twentieth century's major American writers, died in New York in 1947.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/CatherW.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

It contains descriptions of food shortages, wagon travel across mountain ranges, and gold rush Sacramento and San Francisco. The journal of the 1851 voyage from San Francisco to New York describes hardships of travel on the recently inaugurated Nicaragua route via San Juan and Greytown, and an Atlantic voyage plagued by an inexperienced captain, coal and food shortages, and a massive storm. Journals of the 1854 voyages to and from San Francisco describe the Isthmus of Panama route and an encounter with Santa Anna's fleet, which was blockading the Acapulco harbor. <a href=\"https://webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=141142\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View catalog record</a>",

Responding to Benjamin Silliman (1841), Catlin defends his conclusions regarding the pipe stone quarry and forwards a copy of his new \"Letters and notes on the manners ... of the North American Indians,\" which contained his observations on the subject. Catlin also offers (1844?) to sell his \"Album,\" presumably \"Catlin’s North American Indian portfolio,\" for the reduced price of thirty pounds. Writing many years later to a Professor Harper, Catlin condemns the Jan., 1870, Piegan or Marias Massacre and the Indian policy of the U.S. military as revealed in a Mar., 1870, letter of Gen. P.H. Sheridan. <a href=\"https://webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=136396\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View catalog record</a>",

She describes their poverty-stricken, desperate and humiliating existence, with no medical care, and in some cases, living five or six to a single ten-foot-square log cabin. Caswell also refers to her own health problems, incessant chills, exhaustion, and feelings of inadequacy: \"Blue! Desperate!

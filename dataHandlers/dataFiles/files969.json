It appeared probable that, to carry the resolution into effect, Liquor had been brought into the Village, it being known that this Chief was fond of it, who after having drank to excess, had retired to his house to sleep; but no sooner was this known, than the House was discovered in flames; and to prevent a disclosure of the Persons, who had committed the act, every house in the Village was fired and burnt down to the ground, to make it appear, as if a general conflagration had by accident taken place.

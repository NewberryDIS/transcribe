His father was a well-known abolitionist who was later nominated as the first vice presidential candidate for the Liberty Party. In 1876, Francis J. LeMoyne erected the first crematorium in the United States near Washington, Pennsylvania. John LeMoyne studied law in Pittsburgh and was admitted to the bar in 1852. That same year he toured the West, deciding to moved to Chicago and begin his law practice. He married with his wife, Julia, the following year. In 1872, LeMoyne became a candidate for the 43rd Congress on the Liberal Party ticket, but was defeated. He ran again for the 44th Congress as a Democrat and won. He served in Congress from May 6, 1876 to March 3, 1877. After losing the re-election, John continued his law practice in Chicago and was known as a \"lawyer of excellent standing and ability\". He retired in 1887 and moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where he died on July 27, 1918. <br \/><br \/>Mainly in-coming correspondence to John V. LeMoyne, received between 1852-1875. The majority of the letters are from family members and friends in Washington, Pennsylvania, including Mary Anderson, Nettie Kennedy, Francis Julius LeMoyne, Frank LeMoyne, Jane LeMoyne, Julia LeMoyne, Madeline LeMoyne, Madeline Romaine Bureau LeMoyne, Nannie LeMoyne, Romaine LeMoyne, Thurston LeMoyne, Lizzie Shaler, Charlotte Wills, John Wills, and Wilma Wills. These letters focus on family affairs in Washington, Pennsylvania, and show his mother's strong religious beliefs. There are also a few letters from LeMoyne's father cautioning his son against speculating on Chicago real estate. Among other matters, letters from friends discuss opportunities in the West (Texas, California, Oregon) and the business climate in Milwaukee. <a href=\"https:\/\/mms.newberry.org\/xml\/xml_files\/LeMoyne.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<\/a>","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":41,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/41","name":"Description","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"John V.

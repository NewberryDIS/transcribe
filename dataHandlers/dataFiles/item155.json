Printing, education, pioneer life, and religion are all discussed within the letters. Included are the papers of Robert Everett, the pastor of Welsh Congregationalist churches in Oneida County, New York, and publisher of Y Cenhadwr Americanaidd (The American Missionary), a Welsh religious reform magazine that was pro-abolition. Also included are letters and materials of Mary Everett, a graduate of New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, who was also involved in the suffrage movement, John Roberts and Sarah Colgrove Everett, pioneers who moved to Kansas Territory in 1854 and were active in abolitionist activities, and Cynthia Everett, a member of the American Missionary Association who taught freedmen in Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina, following the Civil War. <a href=\"https:\/\/mms.newberry.org\/xml\/xml_files\/Everett.xml#sum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide\u00a0<\/a><br \/><br \/> Elizabeth Everett Butler (1818-1877) was the eldest daughter of Robert &amp; Elizabeth Everett.

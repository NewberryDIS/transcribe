Leaming sold him 160 acres of land for 480 dollars which was endorsed on the note & he holds some other collatteral security given him by David & Leaming.  Judge Niles sued David & Leaming to-day for some wood they owed him for.  It is a matter I am not on but I suppose others will sue them & probably ruin them.  It looks dark now, David & Leaming have made much less than I supposed they had since I went out of the mill.  They have taken my name off from some $6000 but only a part of it has been paid but just changed from the liability of N. & D.W. Kendall to the liability of Kendall & Leaming.

I had looked upon the marriage relations as a partnership where two loving hearts put in all they had & commenced life together not where their parents left off, but where their united means enabled them to commence remembering that their childhood home cost their parents long years of toil, & if they would leave an equally pleasant home for their children they must do the same, unless their parents had been so precuriary blessed as to leave them a home ready made.  Neither your parents nor mine were thus fortunate.  We were married.

If I exposed my arms & chest as you do I do not believe I could live a week  I have to be all the time just as careful as possible about wearing flannel.

You do not know how much happier I shall be about you if I know you are doing as I want you to in this matter.  You have no right to neglect any reasonable wish of your husband which looks to restoring you to health & to him.  It frightens me to think what will become of our children if you are not able to look after them.  Now you will do as I want you to do upon this subject & not put it off a day.  You have put off using mustard day after day til I fear you will not attend to yourself at all.  In wearing flannel as I want after a day or two it will be pleasant to you & you will enjoy it.  Get that which is good & soft.

Brother Erasmus wife a long time ago was thought to be in the consumption but she became pregnant during her pregnancy the inflamation in her lungs was subdued & she has been well ever since.  If you are pregnant I want you with me as much as possible so that I can look after you & make you as happy as I can & do all that is possible to remove the inflation in your lungs.  If you return west I shall be very anxious to have Lydia or Mary return with you & if we go on to our farm you shall have Bill & the buggy to ride & go just where you wish & when you wish.  In any case if we go back to the farm we will not keep a dairy & will not attempt to make any more butter than we use ourselves.  Neither will we board any help for the farm.  We can get along with what I earn here & the proceeds of the farm & the sale of some stock & not keep a dairy or board any one but our own family.  I want if you can find at the Home in Boston an interesting & good girl some ten or twelve years old you should take her provided you think she will be useful to you & we shall love her.  There will doubtless be a school near our prairie farm this summer.  If you get a good & interesting little girl we can give her a good home & she can be of use to us.  If you are pregnant I think our child will be a little girl from the [fact] the impregnation took plan just previous to your menses.  Did you not have a similar small flow of menses when you were first impregnated when gave birth to our little girl.  From what I have recently read I think the time of impregnation influences & determines the sex.  I understand that the ovaries of a woman is each month gradually developed  if it a female but in its full development it is male.  This I see has been demonstrated in animals beyond a doubt.  If you are pregnant you will be glad to have a girl I know & so shall I.  Our boys need a sister.  Be sure & tell me all about yourself & your feelings & what you think is best to do.

I shall hire some one to sow, & plow the grain in myself if I cannot get along otherwise.  This plow is also arranged to tend corn by taking out the middle shovel & then one man & a pair of horses can tend as much corn as two men & two horses can with the double shovel plow.  It is strange what improvements are being made every year in agricultural implements.  I wonder if the agricultural implements of New England keep pace with those of the west.

You have done her no injury & why should you hesitate to meet her as  a sister & to overlook anything that is necessary to restore harmony between you.  I think Chandler is wrong to advise you not visit her.  Meet her as an affectional sister & you will be happier for it all your life & so will she & she will love you all the better if you show yourself noble & forgiving.  I will make my plans now I know your wishes & write you all about them in a day or two.  I will bring up the trunk here which contains your clothing.

It rained I am told most of the time I was gone down to our farm & it has rained most of the time since I returned.  The roads are & have been for a long time almost impassible.  I hope it is not as such at our farm.  They had a very dry winter there but it commenced raining while I was there & I am fearful it has continued to rain.

They seem as cozy & happy as you please in their new home at the Teegarden.  The weather has become pleasant at last & to-night is a beautiful moonlight night but the streets are very muddy yet.  I hope you will go out in the open air as much as possible & take the children out but you of course will use every possible precaution to keep them from taking cold.  How much I wish you were here to-night to talk with me, to sleep with me & to love me.  I should enjoy your warm loving embrace & such kisses as I get from your sweet lips & know you would enjoy it equally well.

I should have enjoyed much having you there but I hope you were enjoying yourself as well with the friends of your childhood at your old home & with our dear children.  I took a walk with Charles last night to see a house he has rented.  His wife got sick of boarding at the Teegarden & they are going to keep house.  If Charles remains here I think it is the best thing they can do as board costs him 35 dollars per month.  He has rented a small house at 6 1\/2 per month.  It is plenty large for them as they have no family.  I was in hopes that Ellen's folks would furnish it, but they only furnish a few.  Furniture carpets bedding etc are very high now & so are provisions.  White coffee sugar is 25 cts Butter 37 1\/2 potatoes 90, meat 12 1\/2 etc.  But as Ellen intended doing her own work they will live for less than it will cost them to board.  I don't blame her for not liking the Teegarden as a place to board.  Charles seems perfectly happy as a married man.  He thinks it pays him in his better health even if it does cost something.  I wish he was in prosperous business for he seems to enjoy himself so well now.

If we have comfortable health I think our farm will support us.  I have just called on Charles & Ellen.  They were feeling unpleasantly about their housekeeping arrangements.  I think they have had unpleasant thoughts towards each other if nothing else.  Charles & Ellen with Ellens wishes as I understand decided to board at the Hotel.  In a few days Ellen got sick of it & wanted to keep house.  I advised Charles not to commence keeping house till he had decided what to do for if he did not remain in La Porte it would make it bad for him..  The next time I saw Charles he had hired a small house which Ellen seemed pleasant with & they went to work to get ready to keep house.  Charles & Ellen thought the back kitchen would not do so Charles decided to haul it down & rebuild which well cost him some 15 or 20 dollars. He paid his rent out month in advance.  He got his lumber & nails & he & the carpenter had commenced & hauled down the old kitchen & were putting up the new.  He also got a man to whitewash the house.  Now Ellen has heard of another house which she likes better & is perfectly disgusted with the first house.  Charles don't know what to do.  She tells him she is homesick etc.  I don't know how it will come out.  I greatly fear for him for as I understand he is nearing a point where his funds will be exhausted.  I wish you & Mary would write him a good cheerful letter.  He says he has been looking for letters from you for a long time.  Don't on any account hint anything I have said.  It will only make matters worse.  I should not have written what I have only you wrote me something relative to them in your last.  Charles seems to think he has done all in his power & it is pretty hard not to have his wife satisfied.  Be sure & not start to Lawrence alone & don't on any act. let the baby take cold. Don't start unless the weather is pleasant.  I insist on this.  Be careful & not so bundle the \n(along the side)\nbaby face as to keep him from getting a plenty of fresh air.  He needs fresh air to breathe& you must not take him out unless the weather is fine & pleasant so that he willl take cold I have heard of children being sometimes by covering their faces too closely.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40077,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/40077","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/92dc67ace1e5ebc0a039584a0a48d9f2.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/92dc67ace1e5ebc0a039584a0a48d9f2.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/92dc67ace1e5ebc0a039584a0a48d9f2.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/92dc67ace1e5ebc0a039584a0a48d9f2.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T15:58:05+00:00","modified":"2020-01-21T18:05:19+00:00","filename":"92dc67ace1e5ebc0a039584a0a48d9f2.jpg","authentication":"8c4ff78bc279067360f9d5877704b198","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_01_fl_17_015_02_o2.jpg","size":1181872,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2376,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046057488464896},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170714"],"TimeCreated":["032155"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170714"],"TimeCreated":["032155"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170714"],"TimeCreated":["032155"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"92dc67ace1e5ebc0a039584a0a48d9f2.jpg","FileDateTime":1509378607,"FileSize":1181872,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2376\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2376,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"18mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:14 15:09:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:14 03:21:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:14 03:21:55","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":33,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2986,"ExifImageLength":4523,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":171,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/171","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"La Porte Ind.

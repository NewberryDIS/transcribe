Tell them that I have never ceased to think of them & home, and if we live until the war is over, expect to have the happiness of seeing you all once more.\nIn June, 61, I came in to Nebraska City from the plains & next day enlisted in the 1st Nebraska Infty","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":58067,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/58067","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/94145d9b17186eafac13ca5e21bc84b4.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/94145d9b17186eafac13ca5e21bc84b4.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/94145d9b17186eafac13ca5e21bc84b4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/94145d9b17186eafac13ca5e21bc84b4.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-13T21:20:04+00:00","modified":"2019-11-23T01:41:00+00:00","filename":"94145d9b17186eafac13ca5e21bc84b4.jpg","authentication":"1446eddea114b93f04369f80ce5f4285","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":18,"original_filename":"GR_579_0019_o2.jpg","size":1558927,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2663,"resolution_y":3260,"compression_ratio":0.059857111810949}},"item":{"id":931,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/931","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Needs Review","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"As soon as the Regiment was organized we were sent south, I was intending to write but had an idea at that time, that war was rather dangerous business, and feared you would feel worse about me to know that I was in the Army, than not to hear from me at all: as you probably supposed that I was dead, I thought I would wait awhile as I stood a good chance of soon being in that condition.

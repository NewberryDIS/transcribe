She said after we read it, that the had purposely kept it till after dinner, for fear it may have contained some unfavorable news.  But was glad and so were all of us that it was all good news.  Especially did we feel much interested to hear that part about the union prayer meeting, and the movement to suppress the selling of intoxicating liquors etc.  And Mr. Armable's hopes that we may hope for more good yet in Reinsen with the cause it Jesus.  We are quite comfortable at mr. & Mrs. Jones's.  we say Maria Pugh yesterday - called at the don with the medicine her mother had sent, on our way to the meeting of Am. & For. Christian Union.  WE had hardly time to know how Maria was, as she was at the time attending the family dinner, and we were in a hurry to go to meeting.  But she looked pretty well, and was glad to see us. - that is all of our friends from Remsen & Thten Neab we had yet sent.  this afternoon we mean to call about tea time (Mr. Jones with us) at Mr. D.

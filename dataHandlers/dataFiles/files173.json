Dear Cousins I wish you could listen to our good sermons they are solemn & impressive.\n\n  You say Cousin Nathan you do not yet feel satisfied with regard to Christ's object in coming into the world the atonement wh. he made etc.  I don't know as I can say any thing wh. will satisfy you mind.  I think it is in Christ's death that we have hope, What is, that in dying he made an atonement for sin.  It is true he fulfilled the law in his life but man was exposed to the penalty of that law which was death and he must then suffered it of a Savior had not been provided; but Jesus suffering in his stead satisfied that law and has provided a way wherein all who will believe in him shall be saved of sin and death.  Has He not shown love passing all human comprehension.  Will not those be worthy of eternal punishment who refuse to believe in & obey such a Savior!  I have thought more of this subject this winter than previously it has been the topic of my Sabbath School lessons.

The Academy is a small inferior looking building, and has a bell on it which is rung for all business in the town as well as for the school.  There are two things there which are called stores.

Wayne Road has suspended their work entirely & the estimate on our Road for last month have not as yet been paid, & it causes much talk & uneasiness among the work men & those that have demand against the Road.  \n   I have decided brother to leave the Road, as there is no chance for me at all to be with you. Mr. Jermez told Allen the the last time that he was here that they would do nothing on the Division from Peno to Marion this season & then there would do nothing for me to do but stay with him & I think it is no object for me to stay here any longer or there are no prospects of my doing anything more.  You just pay my expenses for a year or two and then I can not make any more than I can at my tract if I care as much.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40358,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/40358","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/3cd3de4b9efbf9dc1f3237e75d0f0370.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/3cd3de4b9efbf9dc1f3237e75d0f0370.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/3cd3de4b9efbf9dc1f3237e75d0f0370.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3cd3de4b9efbf9dc1f3237e75d0f0370.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T16:30:33+00:00","modified":"2020-01-21T18:05:47+00:00","filename":"3cd3de4b9efbf9dc1f3237e75d0f0370.jpg","authentication":"1efcad1d7035306456d99e750863497d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_025_010_02_o2.jpg","size":1349701,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2258,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.055346463602664},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170719"],"TimeCreated":["000511"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170719"],"TimeCreated":["000511"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170719"],"TimeCreated":["000511"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3cd3de4b9efbf9dc1f3237e75d0f0370.jpg","FileDateTime":1509380800,"FileSize":1349701,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2258\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2258,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:20 09:39:06","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:19 00:05:11","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:19 00:05:11","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3428,"ExifImageLength":5463,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":173,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/173","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"since I come here I have only barely paid my way as I can how you by letting you what my expenses are weekly.

There was meaning in that smile, so cheerful yet so full of purity?, I felt, though she was but a child, that I was in the presense of a [superior] being.

That land which we are now approaching is the island of Love and Benevolence is our queen. Delighted I quickened my pace and soon we stepped on the opposite shore. Beautiful beyond description was this isle. Nature seemed to have chosen this favorite retreat and made it her Eden. No lovely lanscape had I ever seen but a sweet model existed here. Mute with wonder I scarcely moved, and my gentle guide entering into all my rapture gazed upon my face with unclear eyes. Her soul lived not in solitude, but delighted to mingle with others. Were any happy, she rejoiced more than though hers was the good obtained; did any mourn, she loved to weep with them. There were many people gathered in the embrace? unclear groves that studded the isle. All happy in their various ways, seemed particularly to rejoice when they did their neighbor a favor. I was amazed to find no beggars, none destitute of life's comforts and necessaries, neither were there any who reveled in their abundance. I turned to Sympathy to learn the reason of this and she bid me enter the next grove. It was larger than those surrounding and seemed even more verdant.

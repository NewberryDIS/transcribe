Printing, education, pioneer life, and religion are all discussed within the letters. Included are the papers of Robert Everett, the pastor of Welsh Congregationalist churches in Oneida County, New York, and publisher of Y Cenhadwr Americanaidd (The American Missionary), a Welsh religious reform magazine that was pro-abolition. Also included are letters and materials of Mary Everett, a graduate of New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, who was also involved in the suffrage movement, John Roberts and Sarah Colgrove Everett, pioneers who moved to Kansas Territory in 1854 and were active in abolitionist activities, and Cynthia Everett, a member of the American Missionary Association who taught freedmen in Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina, following the Civil War. <a href=\"https:\/\/mms.newberry.org\/xml\/xml_files\/Everett.xml#sum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide <\/a><br \/><br \/>Mary Everett (1830-1916) initially taught school, and later attended the New York Medical College and Hospital for women. After graduating in 1872 she opened a homeopathic practice in New York City. She was one of the first female surgeons in the United States, and active in temperance and women's rights movements form the 1860s until her death in 1916. Her letters to family describe coursework, cases, and often include medical advice and prescriptions. Some of her incoming correspondence is from other female colleagues, as well as other homeopathic physicians with whom she traded advice. Included here are compositions written by Mary between the 1850s and the 1880s.","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":41,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/41","name":"Description","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Mary Everett writings, 1850s-1880s","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":50,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/50","name":"Title","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"School compositions on slavery and a rural excursion.","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":46,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/46","name":"Relation","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}

Mr. Acheson + Will McRennan? were\nvery mad, and they almost came to \nblows over it. And now it will\nwait until next court. The Bradys\nsay if the decision is in Dick's favor\nthey will carry it to the supreme court.\nBut I don't think Dick feels uneasy.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":47402,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/47402","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/a9970c3e98c05bc0e0d2c34181bd0004.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/a9970c3e98c05bc0e0d2c34181bd0004.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/a9970c3e98c05bc0e0d2c34181bd0004.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a9970c3e98c05bc0e0d2c34181bd0004.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-09T15:53:02+00:00","modified":"2020-01-23T20:53:33+00:00","filename":"a9970c3e98c05bc0e0d2c34181bd0004.jpg","authentication":"031272e63fcb63a003217e171205a33c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_le_moyne_box_01_fl_04_37_06_o2.jpg","size":1278639,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2692,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.043979383358098},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171101"],"TimeCreated":["002918"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["163916"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171101"],"TimeCreated":["002918"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["163916"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20171101"],"TimeCreated":["002918"],"City":["Yes"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["163916"],"CopyrightNotice":["The Newberry Library"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a9970c3e98c05bc0e0d2c34181bd0004.jpg","FileDateTime":1510242596,"FileSize":1278639,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2692\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2692,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:11:02 09:47:17","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:11:01 00:29:18","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:11:01 00:29:18","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":19,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2300,"ExifImageLength":3075,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":210,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/210","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Needs Review","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I'm afraid Annie will not keep to\nher promise of going to Chicago in the \nSpring.

I am not \nparticularly anxious that you should remain in Chicago nor \nthat you should pursue the law, if it is irksome to you, nor can \nI expect you to be with me (that would be too good), but as

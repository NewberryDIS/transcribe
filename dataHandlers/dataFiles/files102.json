But, as in your case, it was my \ndeep seated horror of the system which is a disgrace to our country, \nand a sin in the sight of our nation's Preserver.  I shrunk \nfrom the idea of living among the poor slaves, without the power \nof aiding them in any way.  The power of adding one item to their \nscanty measure of happiness.  Whether you and I have \nbeen doing right in this matter, eternity will show -\nIt remains for us, now, to leave the result of our decision to \nthat Providence which directeth all things aright.\nIn second once with my good father's advice, I have returned to \nour pleasant \"Holyoke home\", probably to remain two years.

Monroe St. begin quite in the city, is better for sight seeing, & life in general, but the air here is very much better and purer. We are quite near Lincoln Park which runs along the Lake, five minutes walk from here, straight across the park we are on the lake shore, and on a fine day, it is perfectly delightful, such a large expanse of water, it reminds me of the Ocean.

So passed sevel? days & in the meantime we learned that your brother was quite sick and had gone home. The last time we saw him he looked very tired and I thought low spirited.

Lately there is little material for a diary and I am sorry to say I have neglected it. Did you hear the alarm of fire which early one evening not long since was given? Somebody had placed a small quantity of pitch & unclear of the desks in our school room and lighted them. Some men unclear the fire before it had done more than to unclear a desks & burn a few books. By tracks in the snow it was plain they had got in at the window.

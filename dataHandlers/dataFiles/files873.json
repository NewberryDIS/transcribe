Tery. Sept. 17th 1841.\nHon. John Bell: -\nSir, Though I have not the honor of a personal acquaintence with you, I hope I shall not be considered an intruder. If I venture to suggest a few things relative to matters & things upon this frontier, in which I concieve you to be interested, as they lie principally within the province of the Dept. over which you preside. I am aware that you derive much & valuable information from the numerous officers, dependant upon your Dept. but still my residence in this country for some years and my personal acquaintence with the country for 500 miles above this by the course of River, may enable me to suggest some things which have not occured to their minds.\nThe first thing that strikes the observing mind, here, is the rolling tide of emigration, & the consequent rapid settlement of \"the West,\" together with the encroachments these settlements are making upon the habitations of the Aborigines or original Lords of the soil. And as these are properly the wards of your Dept. it is in refereance to them & their final destiny, that I wish principally to direct your attention. other matters being only incidentally connected therewith. \nIf you will spread a map of the United States before you, & cast your eye along the Allegheny Mountains, you see at once the most general line of demarkation between the whites & the red men of the forests, as it stood 50 years ago. Since then, a population of 4,000,000, have increased to 17,000,000, who have peopled 11 states in the west & Maine & Vermont in the east. Making 13, besides 3 Territories - equil to one state, & western Penn. & Virginia equil to another. In all equil to 15 states. Upon the same ratio of increase 17,000,000, will so increase as to settle upwords of 60 states in 50 years to come. But when you estimate the entire extent of the U. S. Tery. west of the new states, you will find territory enough for only about 28 states in the size of Penn.y. and consequently, our ratio of increase for 50 years past if it continues (& no one doubts it) will fill up or settle the whole Ter'y, to the Pacific Ocean in about 20 or 25 years","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":55280,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/55280","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/2cd98684ec57b8184d0ede792bfdddbb.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/2cd98684ec57b8184d0ede792bfdddbb.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/2cd98684ec57b8184d0ede792bfdddbb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2cd98684ec57b8184d0ede792bfdddbb.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-08T21:20:03+00:00","modified":"2020-01-24T20:36:27+00:00","filename":"2cd98684ec57b8184d0ede792bfdddbb.jpg","authentication":"42928b36752e0ca58e796136e67b0536","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"GR_452_0002_o2.jpg","size":2194767,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2318,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.087670046016681}},"item":{"id":873,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/873","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Needs Review","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"But we have half a million of Indians to be provided for, & allowing the present policy of the Govt. in forming them into Indian Territories, of say 100,000, it will require an end equil to 5 states for them to occupy.

And when thus filled or settled by the whites, we shall have the Indians in close juxtaposition, throughout the entire west.

Hence the great change in the Wyandotts, the Chippewas in Canada, the Cherokees, Chocktaws, &c in the South and several of the lessor tribes in the Western Territory.

This consent of Wiskonson can be more readily obtained in one way, than in any other, if it can be obtained at all.  That is, if Congress will take some measures to induce Michigan to recede that portion of her state which lies west of Green Bay, & south of Lake Superior.  The people of Wis. feel not well pleased with the measure adopted, which took from our natural limits a district equil to some of the smaller states, & gave it to a state from which it is severed by natural boundaries, and to regain that country, I think, from what I learned in the Legislation the people would consent to lose that portion of the Tery. which lies west of a line drawn from the bend of the River 8 miles","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":55282,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/55282","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/dc7ceaeee1bb20b390a7e3aec5fd2012.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/dc7ceaeee1bb20b390a7e3aec5fd2012.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/dc7ceaeee1bb20b390a7e3aec5fd2012.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/dc7ceaeee1bb20b390a7e3aec5fd2012.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-08T21:20:05+00:00","modified":"2020-01-24T20:36:27+00:00","filename":"dc7ceaeee1bb20b390a7e3aec5fd2012.jpg","authentication":"51c01e9385549a233497a35ec2406a96","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"GR_452_0004_o2.jpg","size":2089753,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2228,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.086847238845668}},"item":{"id":873,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/873","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Needs Review","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"east of Fort Snelling, nearly north to the head of the lower falls of the St. Louis River, head of Lake Superior, & north of that Lake.

It would leave nearly or quite the entire waters of the St. Croix within this Tery. & the wates of Rum River within the Ind. Tery.  It would give the whites access to the harbor at Fon du Lac (the head of L.

If, then, the Chippewas should be moved into the country west & north of Lake Superior, the country bordering & south of that Lake would soon settle by the whites.

The soil is very rich & abounds in mineral resoures, timber, &c, and the fisheries would soon be of equil if not superior value to those of Newfoundland: and what is a fact, but little know, the climate is equil to that of New England two degrees farther south, owing, probably, to its being less elevated above the levil of the sea.\nA Fort at Fon du Lac, would tend to keep the Ind. in subjection, could intercept & cut off any attempts of the British to induce them to hostilities, would induce a white settlement by affording protection, could be supplied by ships from Fort Brady, and with one provision in a treaty of peace between the Sioux & Chippewas, could prevent hostilities between those two tribes - that is, have them agree that when one of either tribe killed one of another, the murderer should be given up to the tribe of the murdered for punishment, this provision to be carried into effect by United States troops, on complaint being entered.  I am convinced, from an intercourse of some years with the Indians, that they would agree to such a stipulation & that it would be effetual in preserving peace among them.

And it is known that if suitable encouragements are held out, hundreds of the half breeds will move within our limits for the same purpose.

Lat. the cressent bend of the St Peters River, at which point it is proposed, (as I am informed) to settle the Winnebagoes, will be but a few miles from the Iowa line, and as part of the tributaries of the St. Peters, from the south, will come from within the State of Iowa, the Indians may assend them beyond their limits, or the whites may decend them for the purposes","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":55285,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/55285","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/f5340a23e5c4f4bbe5a9118f4f8fb154.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/f5340a23e5c4f4bbe5a9118f4f8fb154.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/f5340a23e5c4f4bbe5a9118f4f8fb154.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f5340a23e5c4f4bbe5a9118f4f8fb154.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-08T21:20:09+00:00","modified":"2020-01-24T20:36:27+00:00","filename":"f5340a23e5c4f4bbe5a9118f4f8fb154.jpg","authentication":"2cf92ef7eeacef91815782bd8051884f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"GR_452_0007_o2.jpg","size":2320492,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2390,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.08989973655664}},"item":{"id":873,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/873","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Needs Review","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"of trade.  This would bring the two colors into contact, & to the same disadvantage as before mentioned.  But from the map, (I use Judsons map of Wis. & Iowa) it appears that 43 1\/2 deg N. Lat. would leave all the waters of the St. Peters river within the proposed Ind. Tery. & consequently avoid the difficulties arrising from the conact of the two colors.\nOn the western boundary, I should suppose, the North Red River with its tributaries should come within the Tery.  If the map is any way near correct the 20 1\/2 deg. W. Long. from Washington will be about the point.  Farther west would take in some of the tributaries of the Missouri, & farther east would leave out some of the tributaries of Red River.  One object, in the premises, not to be lost sight of, is, the half breeds of the Selkirk Red River Settlement are inclining to migrate to within our country.  Many of the whites have done so, & settled on the west side of the St. Croix Lake, & others are expected to follow.  The half breeds, it is said, prefer our country, & if settled within our limits and their friendship secured, they would form a barrier to the invation of the British from that quarter in case of war.  The great thoroughfare for all this imigration from that region to our limits, is on the Red River, hence the propriety of that River being within the Tery.  I am told that the Red River half breed, would prefer to settle on the Red River, while those along Lake Superior would probably prefer to settle west or N. West of the Lake.\nIf it be found impracticable to unite the Sioux & Chippewas in one Tery. & under one Govt. or Superintendency, perhaps the best remedy for the evil would be the establishment of two Tery; one for each, with such other bands as would unite with them.  The seat of Govt. for one at St. Peters & the other at Fon du Lac.\nIt will be seen that the proposed western boundary will leave sufficient Tery. for the formation of states, including the Missouri River.  And as that River must be the great thoroughfare to the Oregon Tery. a chain of white states should be formed along that water course.\nI have already extended this letter far beyond my original intention; but there is one point more on which I wish to touch, & which my own observation has proved to be of vital importance to the objects contemplated by the Govt.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":55286,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/55286","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/deeda7c46721e58f27aea46d5695dedd.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/deeda7c46721e58f27aea46d5695dedd.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/deeda7c46721e58f27aea46d5695dedd.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/deeda7c46721e58f27aea46d5695dedd.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-08T21:20:10+00:00","modified":"2020-01-24T20:36:27+00:00","filename":"deeda7c46721e58f27aea46d5695dedd.jpg","authentication":"8b51018f99ac0be5fab55244f995516f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"GR_452_0008_o2.jpg","size":2019763,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":0,"item":{"id":873,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/873","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Needs Review","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"that is, the characters of the Gov.

the First. Traditions of the Cherokee concerning what is considered as their early and orthodox religion. There appears to have been a belief, as far back as the history of this nation can be traced, that certain beings came down from on high, and formed the world, the moon and the stars. These beings were supposed to have always existed together and always to have been identified with each other; one in sentiment and action, and so remaining eternally. We call them Beings, because the Cherokee word designating them, implies, according to the peculiar genius of the original language, not only more than one, but more than two.

Presently he is joined by a considerable number of men; -- (women do not participate in this dance); -- some with guns and pistols charged with powder and wadding; others, with clubs, poles and branches of trees. Heading the column, he proceeds several times around the yard; then commenced crossing it backwards and forwards, repeatedly, until he has, in this manner, traversed it from one end to the other.

We now proceed to the changes in the fourth of the succession, being the Nung, tah,-- tay -- quah, -- the Great New Moon Feast.  No account is given of any special form of conveying permission for local celebrations of this feast.  It is simply stated that, at the first appearance of the Great New Moon of Autumn, the people of each town assembled at the dwelling of the priest; or, more recently, at that of him now termed the conjurer; who, on this occasion, had two right hand men subject to his orders.  The right hand men appointed seven men to hunt, and seven men and seven women to fast, seven days previous to the Festival.  One of these right hand men selected seven men to sing for the women.  The first of the seven took his place, commencing his chaunt.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69956,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69956","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/bd21bffdfe80e0452419b5b78d1c676e.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/bd21bffdfe80e0452419b5b78d1c676e.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/bd21bffdfe80e0452419b5b78d1c676e.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/bd21bffdfe80e0452419b5b78d1c676e.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:09:50+00:00","modified":"2020-04-29T20:52:49+00:00","filename":"bd21bffdfe80e0452419b5b78d1c676e.jpg","authentication":"e9a2cc6a3562b2ddd405fb96851e3c3c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL01_00144_o2.jpg","size":585795,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2752,"compression_ratio":0.039418806524548},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000115"],"TimeCreated":["234322+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000115"],"TimeCreated":["234322+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000115"],"TimeCreated":["234322+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"bd21bffdfe80e0452419b5b78d1c676e.jpg","FileDateTime":1522422465,"FileSize":585795,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2752\"","Height":2752,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2752,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:02:24","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3969},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:15 23:43:22","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:15 23:43:22","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":58,"SubSecTimeOriginal":58,"SubSecTimeDigitized":58,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2752,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1048,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1048","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"chaunt.

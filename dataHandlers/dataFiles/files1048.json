the First. Traditions of the Cherokee concerning what is considered as their early and orthodox religion. There appears to have been a belief, as far back as the history of this nation can be traced, that certain beings came down from on high, and formed the world, the moon and the stars. These beings were supposed to have always existed together and always to have been identified with each other; one in sentiment and action, and so remaining eternally. We call them Beings, because the Cherokee word designating them, implies, according to the peculiar genius of the original language, not only more than one, but more than two.

nu, li, no, he, ski, - Seven Counsellors - called all to arise. Each of the seven called out those of his own clan to pray. Did one of a different clan mingle with those of another, he was called a fool; which they consider as their most reproachful term. All stood and held the palm of the hand towards the east, with the fingers up, while the priest prayed: Then, all spat on the palm of the hand, put it on the breast, and rubbed it up over the face and head. Then all went to the stream,- washed hands and face, - drank a little water and returned. The priest then went to the altar where the sacrifice had been burned the day before, took some of the white ashes on the palm of his hand rubbed it up his breast, face, and forehead, and ordered others to do the same. He again offered sacrifice and prayed and the day was then devoted mostly to a religious dance. At day break on the fourth day, all arose,- turned towards the east, raised the right hand as high as the head, with the palm towards the east, raised the right hand as high as the head, with the palm towards the east,- while the priest prayed, holding his right hand in the same position. Just as the sun arose, he ordered all to the stream.

The Law of descent was altered so far that the Estate of the Father, in place of going to his Brothers & Sisters or their children should go to his children & if no children then to his Brothers & Sisters or their children. I do not recollect what alteration took place in regard to the property of the Mothers, whether it was to vest? in the Husband, or whether it remained to her and to her children independent of the Husband. The letter I am intended to think is the fact. 3'd Slaves were considered personal property subject to the same Law of descent indeed a title to deal Estate individually us wholly unknown to the Indian Law.

I think the 5th of here was on Monday. on the day before (Sunday) I received information from a friend in Milledgeville, that Capt. Bowen was going to Savannah at 12 Oclock on Monday in the stage?.Immediately sent a servant express to him, requesting that he would afford me a opportunity of taking his testimony before his departure, and that, I would be in Milledgeville early on Monday, and Notify the Gov., and wished him to attend at the house of James Roupeau Esq. I went to town early on Monday, and had a Notice served on the Gov. as soon as the executive office was open, and at ten Oclock attended at the Magistrates house, but Capt Bowen was not, and had not been there. I became uneasy lest he should disappoint me, and went from the Magistrates, to the house of a Brother in Law of Capt Bowen, who lives in Milledgeville, to inquire for him,","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64273,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64273","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/93fd5a6b5a0d34653b2e73acfb82a03f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/93fd5a6b5a0d34653b2e73acfb82a03f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/93fd5a6b5a0d34653b2e73acfb82a03f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/93fd5a6b5a0d34653b2e73acfb82a03f.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T14:30:42+00:00","modified":"2020-05-04T08:02:00+00:00","filename":"93fd5a6b5a0d34653b2e73acfb82a03f.jpg","authentication":"5b9877890fd23a49b7609c523bba146b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_606_FL009_00005_o2 copy.jpg","size":944772,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2783,"compression_ratio":0.062866610771749},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120517"],"TimeCreated":["130028+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120517"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120517"],"TimeCreated":["130028+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120517"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120517"],"TimeCreated":["130028+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120517"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"93fd5a6b5a0d34653b2e73acfb82a03f.jpg","FileDateTime":1521815294,"FileSize":944772,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2783\"","Height":2783,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2783,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:22 16:37:56","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6906},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:17 13:00:28","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:17 13:00:28","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":82,"SubSecTimeDigitized":82,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2783,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":992,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/992","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"but, could hear nothing of him, except that he was expected in town to go in the stage at 12 Oclock. on my way to make this enquiry [sic], I saw Gov.

We were mercifully spared from suffering during the severe cold of Jan. 7, 8, and 9th.  The papers tell of 28 persons frozen to death in the western part of this state.  A good many about here were frost bitten -- ears, nose cheeks hands or feet.  A good many hogs and some cattle men frozen to death.  One man about seven miles south lost 7 or 8 cows.  The greater number of cattle about here have no shelter except wind-breaks and some have sheds where they can get shelter.  And with 3 to 5 days of strong north wind with the mercury merging from 0 to 18 or 20 below zero it was a terrible strain on man and beast.

I had my pen and paper ready to write you last Wednesday evening to assure you that none of us were harmed during the storm of last sunday evening but changed my plans and wrote to Charlie first and then it was bed time.  That storm which was so fatal in Omaha and other places did no damage in Kansas but we had high wind at the same time.  We are very thankful that none of our relatives were in the flooded towns of Ohio of which we read such heart rending accounts.  We are very glad that Robert is not there.\nCarroll and Charlie each have a copy of the memoir and we have three copies.  To have one for each of the boys and one for ourselves we need two more.  The boys will prize them now, but they will prize them much more in years to come.\nI am sorry you are still having trouble with your stomach.

Quite a number of the boys, and two of the teachers were at the funeral, which was at Frankfort, about thirteen miles east of here, on the Central Rail Road.  Mr. Valentine was at a party in the house where he boarded, and roomed week ago yesterday, apparently in good health, and probably ate too much cake, and the next day he was taken very sick with the \"Billious Colic\".  His folks were sent for immediately and he had the best of care but of no avail.  His sickness terminated in the \"Inflamation of the Bowels,\" and about three o'clock Saturday afternoon he died, and carried home on the cars that night a corpse.  He was buried Sunday, but the funeral sermon was not preached until Monday.  When on his death bed he was in great distress of mind and exclaimed \"It is too late, I have neglected my soul in health, and now it is too late.\"  What a lesson this should teach us.\nThis morning Mr. McEntie bid us adieu, and expects to start from Rome soon, for the war.

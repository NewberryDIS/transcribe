One of a group of nurses who left Chicago for Cuba during the Spanish-American War in July, 1898, she wrote about herself: \"We are the first body of women to go out in the time of war under the Government of the United States. What we go to face we do not know.\" Nursing in a camp hospital in Siboney, Cuba, for little over a month, Wingreen too contracted fever, but continued with her work until leaving in late August.<br \/><br \/>The collection includes letters, often reading like a diary, which Amy Wingreen sent to her sister, mother and nephew as she traveled from Chicago to Cuba and back again to New York and Washington in the summer of 1898, plus a small group of letters to her from relatives and friends of some of the soldiers she nursed. The collection also includes miscellaneous material relating to her medical service from April, 1898, to December, 1899, and two narratives of her experiences, one by her and one by her (later) executor Esther Turkington. <a href=\"https:\/\/i-share.carli.illinois.edu\/nby\/cgi-bin\/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=184085\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<\/a>","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":41,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/41","name":"Description","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"To transcribe","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/40b456dd59d8fb7d4c95c1a611ef759a.jpg","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":48,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/48","name":"Source","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"19","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":55,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/55","name":"Percent Completed","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"019100","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":56,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/56","name":"Weight","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}

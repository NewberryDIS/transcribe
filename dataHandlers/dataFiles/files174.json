I received a circular from sister, was glad\nto see that you prospered so well in school concluded you\nwas well as you said nothing in respect to it. I should have\nwritten to you longere this had not my evenings all been occupied\nI have to spend 1 or 2 at the school house every week\nwith my Arithmetic classes &c. I am at Dist No 5\nas I suppose you already know and heard with cousin Mary.\nMy school consists of 28 scholars the oldest 18 yrs youngest 4 yrs of\nage I have had no trouble as yet and hope for none. I have kept\n9 weeks and have about 4 weeks longer I suppose. I do not know\nwhat I shall do in the spring I shall not attend school I think\nnow. I sometimes think that I shall not try to go much\nmore for it costs as much as I can make about as much\nteaching common schools. Jesse does not take hold of\nhis studies as I wish he would he is to wild for his own\ninterest but I hope as he grows older he will sober down-\nMother's health is very good as a general thing for her.\nErasmus's people are quite well they have a very pretty\nbabe.

There seems to be a prevailing desire manifested by most young people to spend their time in an unprofitable manner, it does not seem to arise from any thing of evil on their part but from a want of courage to break over the bounds which their associates have established, They cannot endure the sneers of their fellows, cannot support their (if I may so speak) by conversing in an intelligible manner for fear they will be sober.  As an excuse for not engaging in conversation people sometimes say that they {crossed out phrase: can find nothing} are not able to converse as well as other, if they are not they never wil be unless there is some effort on their part to become so. Though it requires some effort to do this yet the benefits which result more than recompense anyone for his trouble, his own personal happiness is greatly increased and he is able to accomplish a much greater amount of good than he otherwise could, for as he understand and those who listen cannot fail to comprehend what is meant without the trouble of trying to solve the puzzling enigmas in which those persons are obliged to express themselves who are not accustomed to expressing their ideas frequently. The great end and aim of all seems to be happiness and as the power to converse will greatly increase our happiness it is strange that there is not a greater effort made to secure this treasure. It is the duty of every one to do all the good in his power and as the power to converse will enable anyone to wield a greater influence than others he can cause greatly more good and it is manifest that he ought to cultivate these powers which have been given him. \nJ.C.

Though in Autumn all vegetable matter passes into an apparently lifeless state it is only a temporary one, and when the proper requisites for its life and growth are brought around it, the buds come forth and then the leaves till finally the fields, hills and groves teem again with life and beauty. How delightful the change! We tire of sameness and would not know how to prize so many rich blessings unless deprived of them for a time. The growth and perfection of a plant depends entirely upon the influences by which it is surrounded. The farmer aware of this fact throws around the seed which he places in the ground all those influences which will effect their growth. If he fail to do this he finds that his Autumn is a fruitless one, that instead of being blessed with a rich harvest that his seed has been worse than thrown away, that instead of a plentious board his family are starving for bread. Youth has been compared to Spring and Manhood to Autumn. There is so very striking a resemblance that it cannot fail to be seen by the observer. If anyone neglect in youth to cultivate his mind, to get that instruction which is necessary for the growth and perfection of his mental, moral and affectionate being his Autumn of life will fail to be a pleasant one. He will find alas! too late that in order to have old pleasant that a store of knowledge must be laid up beforehand upon which to feast, that all the passions must be kept in subjection or they will like thorns and thistles root out all the better fruit, but when our bodies, which like all natural substances must undergo decomposition are worn out and laid low then will we like the plants spring forth into a brighter and more lovely existence where there will be no unfavorable influences to retard our progress in a knowledge of all those things which will make us virtuous and happy. \nI.C.

It is among those who are deprived of the means of obtaining luxuries for those who revel amid scenes? where no energy is required, where nothing is to be done but to indulge in the gratification of all those desires which have a tendency to degenerate men are considered? stupid and unfit for the more refined employment of exercising the imagination. When seated as am I want to be under a thatched roof with no room made comfortable by a warm fire which I can call my own and with no furniture but such as is absolutely necessary and no wardrobe of silk and satin but one consisting only of such things as are most economical whether they exactly suit the fancy of their owner or not.

How often do we notice the conversation of persons who have not met for many year turn upon something that happened at the time of their acquaintance though it might have commenced on a subject the most remote from it. This is in cosequence of the deep impressions made on the mind at the time and the principle of the association. The presence of this old aequaintance bring to mind all the former scenes in which they both participated, and the memory of these past scenes being pleasant each individual is kindly looked upon as a contribution to the happiness of the other and in this way an attachment is formed which is very endearing. We often notice the effects which are produced by the principle of associated in foreigners. When foreigners that never met before meet in this country, they feel that they are meeting (in the presence of) olf friends who can appriciate their worth and in whom they can confide; in fact those who can understand their feelings.

March of Life\nHow smoothly and happily do some persons move through life, while others are continually stumbling and hobbling along as though they thought the road almost impassable or at least very rough. To what is this attributable? Is the fault ours or is some one else to blame? When we stop to consider for a moment we answer that it rests with ourselves whether our march be one of ease and happiness or one of pain and misery. The March of Life may be compared to a long journey through pleasant valleys and over steep hills, through dreary wastes and peopled cities. In order that a journey of this kind may be pleasant and agreeable the traveler must be equipped for it, must be prepared to brave all the dangers to which he may be exposed.

It was a beautiful evening. The balmy breeze of the evening contrasted well with the close air of the day. I prolonged by walk till I reached the shore of a beautiful stream where I was impelled by the beauties by which I found myself surrounded to stop. While gazing around, first upon the clear water which reflected the moon and glittering stars, disturbed here and there by fishes coming up to get a little more air.

of Habit\nThe mental as well as moral constitution of man is under the influence of habits which are acquired by repetition or practice. By constant practice we form habits of walking, talking and writing that characterize us at all times, by which characteristics our acquaintances are able to recognize us. The facility with which some learn to repeat passages and the ease with which some appear on the stage both declaiming and reading compositions is to be attributed to habit. Though genius and a moderate share of self esteem is requisite to a good speaker and writer, they are wasted unless we habituate ourselves to speaking and reading before the public. For instance let two individuals equally talented, one in the habit of appearing before the public and the other not, be called upon to deliver a lecture; one would appear graceful and easy in his manners while the other would appear awkward and therefor uninteresting. The sense of touch, taste, smell, hearing and sight can be cultivated by practice so as to serve various purposes for which without cultivation they are wholly unfit. By the loss of one of the senses the others are called into use and are thereby brought to a greater state of perfection. Those who are deprived of the sense of sight cultivate the touch till it becomes so nice that they may without fear traverse grounds that they have been over and go through the house and find anything they may wish being able to distinguish their own things from others though they appear just alike\nN8","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":43435,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/43435","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c9fb6b5946253ca17eed0da06e609e39.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/c9fb6b5946253ca17eed0da06e609e39.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/c9fb6b5946253ca17eed0da06e609e39.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c9fb6b5946253ca17eed0da06e609e39.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-31T17:17:03+00:00","modified":"2020-03-30T13:28:29+00:00","filename":"c9fb6b5946253ca17eed0da06e609e39.jpg","authentication":"365b1c6b1ee959fec8b00faedfc2e55b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_05_fl_107_014_002_o2.jpg","size":1527754,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2942,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048082496160334},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["040835"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["040835"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170810"],"TimeCreated":["040835"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c9fb6b5946253ca17eed0da06e609e39.jpg","FileDateTime":1509469959,"FileSize":1527754,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2942\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2942,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:08:10 16:40:10","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:08:10 04:08:35","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:08:10 04:08:35","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3098,"ExifImageLength":3790,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":189,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/189","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The blind can by feeling read in which case they substitute the fingers for the eyes.

A great number of people of all ages and sizes assembled to witness the joyful scene. Some appeared sedate and thoughtful other giddy and thoughtless while the bride was about half way between. I could not help noticing her as she moved around among her acquaintances how graceful was every motion and how expressive every look. After the crowd had dispersed and the weddingers had reached the boat that was to transport them to a distant land I retired to my room and wished to myself perhaps out loud that I knew the history of the young lady when to my surprise the hearthstone broke forth in the following strain. Tis just twenty years since first I knew Eliza. She was then a most beautiful creature the pet of the family. As is usual with girls she was humored and petted till she thought she must always have her own way and she always had till she was twelve years old when her mother died and she was placed in the care of an aunt who was more as a parent should be than was her natural parent. It was well for Eliza that she had a more suitable instructress and companion though it was hard to submit such strict and as she thought needless government.

The Bablonians occupied four years in preparing for this war but Darius with the whole force of the Persian Empire succeeded in destroying the city which had been unclear in a terrible manner even though the Babylonians used every means to preserve it in their power adopting such outrageous resolutions as the following, that of destroying all such persons as were not servicable even their wives and children by strangulation. The bablonians strengthd so much their forces in this manner that they regarded them as impregnable and for a time they did seem to render the unclear efforts of the Persian fruitless but fortune favored them after the lapse of eighteen months. Zophyrus, a devoted friend of the kings feeling a strong desire that Darius should succeed in the enterprise in which he had been obliged to engage, caused his own ears and nose to be taken off and himself to be covered with many wounds then presented himself to the king stating his intention of going in this conclusion to the enemy and representing there that he had been thus injured by the king for daring to advise him to give up fighting against a people as well armed as they had had proof that the bablonians were. He went and as he anticipated was placed commander over many troops finally he was intrusted with guarding the gates of the city which he allowed Darius to enter without any resistance.

As the Scythians became intermingled with more learned and avaricious nations they seemed to lose their peculiar characteristics of innocence simplicity and frugality and were transformed into very different individuals. It was before this change that Darius warred with them. There seems to have been no real cause for this war but was engaged in on the part of Darius to gratify ambitious desires. He did not as his brothers advised him consider whether it was just and for the good of his subjects but hastily assembled a large army with which he thought to conquer them easily and marched forward but he soon wearied of the long marches which he was obliged to take through countries which the Scythians had rendered destitute of water by filling up the wells and springs which were not very abundant at any time.

Darius resolving to go to war was himself this time having had his army defeated at Marathon was obliged according to law to name his successor before his departure. Though Artabarganes was his elder son Xerxes became his successor for several reasons the principal of which was that he was eldest son of the king while his brother was only the eldest son of Darius. This matter was left to Darius' brother who decided in favor of Xerxes, with which decision all seemed satisfied. Darius never returned but was much lamented by his subjects though they were aware that he was not destitute of faults. He seemed to love justice and respect laws yet many times did his passions cause him to act contrary to justice and law, Xerxes who reigned 12 years spent the first four in preparing for the war against the Grecians whcih his father had begun. In consequence of his care and the extent of his kingdom he commanded the largest army of which record consisting of 5,283,220. These millions of people consumed 662,040 bushels of flour per day besides other provisions in proportion which Xerxes had conveyed to them by ships. We are told that the army was so large that in order to number it they were all required to stand successively within a wall which would hold a certain number. All the Athenians in banishment were called home among whom was Aristides. All were needed at this trying time. Leonidas, a Spartan was chosen commander of the Grecian army for the first battle.

Xerxes' loss was more than 20,000. Leonidas the brave commander was caused to be hung by Xerxes who felt enraged at him for resisting him so long. Though Xerxes was apparently successful at the battle of Thermopylae yet Leonidas with the 300 Spartans who fell with him exhibited such daring and noble spirits that the Grecians were inspired with courage to fight on in defence of their country while intimidated the Persians destroying in them every hope of subverting Greece. The Athenians thought it advisable to desert Athens in order better to be able to defend other portions of their country. They had an engagement at Salamin in which place the Grecian fleets were all assembled under Themistocles who succeeded (with the aid of Aristides) in defeating the enemy and causing Xerxes to flee for safety to his own country.  Though Xerxes commanded so large an army and engaged in war so often that he was not a brave man but on the contrary was in constant fear for his own personal safety. Mardonius was left with 300,000 men to perform the work that more than 1,000,000 could not do. Mardonius tried to tempt the Athenians with beautiful presents but they informed him that nothing would tempt them to give up their liberty. Aristides gradually gained the favor of his people again and ever acted justly, he addressed one of the ambassadors of Mardonius thus \"Be assured that as long as that planet (pointing to the sun) shall continue its course the Athenians will be mortal enemies to the Persians and will not cease to take vengeance of them for ravaging their lands and burning their temples.\" The next battle was at Plutae in which they were again successful. The Ionians left the Persians and united with the Grecians. There are many interesting accounts relative to Xerxes that might be given. I will only say that the proud and obstinate Xerxes who possessed scarcely a redeeming trait was killed by Artobanus one of his

us not tire but pursue it still farther; at every short distance it is increased by new streams flowing into it, but we have come to a mill which is turned by the water of this stream thus affording means to the miller by which to convert the grain raised by the farmer into flour and meal for food.On, on we go the stream continually increasing, new waters joining the main waters till it has become a river but it does not end here, therefore we must not tire. We see at every little distance boars and towns clinging very closely to the water, yes, for it is from this they gain their sustenance. Still more rivers join it till it has become so wide we can hardly see across it therefore we can pursue it but little farther. We shall soon get to the ocean; we are there and it is useless to try to proceed for the water sometimes runs in one direction and sometimes in another. Since we can go no further let us consider what is the use of all this. The stream has been of great use from the first for the larger and more powerful it became the greater good it accomplished. No charges were made or thank yous said for its water and yet everyone who desired could use as much as they wanted and for any use they wanted it, but I am sure they are welcome to it for there is plenty and to spare.

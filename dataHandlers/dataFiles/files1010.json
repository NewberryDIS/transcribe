C.\n\"Through Headquarters Military Division of the MO\",\nSir:\n\n      I have the honor of transmitting a copy of a Military Map or Western Texas, compiled [underline 6 words] under my direction for Consideration in connection with my annual report dated October 2nd 1878, and with the request that it may be published in a convenient form,\n      Under instructions from these headquarters, to the Commanding Officer, District of the Pecos, extensive explorations by scouting parties have been made.  The valuable information thus secured, has been embodied in a map of that district, compiled under the direction of the district Commander, In gaining the information thus embraced, a vast amount of work was done in the field by Officers, Companies and detachments, the aggregate distance marched by the troops being 24, 469 miles.  The figures indicate the extent of the information, which has been transferred to the map now transmitted, adding greatly to its value.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":66758,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/66758","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/1296012bcc752b458939341c6a56f19c.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/1296012bcc752b458939341c6a56f19c.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/1296012bcc752b458939341c6a56f19c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1296012bcc752b458939341c6a56f19c.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-24T18:39:03+00:00","modified":"2020-01-29T21:28:46+00:00","filename":"1296012bcc752b458939341c6a56f19c.jpg","authentication":"77c7c440eccc3a071c4d4750638e5dfe","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3039_BX04_FL221_00002_o2.jpg","size":772785,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2290,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.031246360989811},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120612"],"TimeCreated":["094905+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120612"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120612"],"TimeCreated":["094905+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120612"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120612"],"TimeCreated":["094905+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120612"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1296012bcc752b458939341c6a56f19c.jpg","FileDateTime":1521916711,"FileSize":772785,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2290\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2290,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:07:25 15:50:46","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":180},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:12 09:49:05","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:12 09:49:05","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":62,"SubSecTimeDigitized":62,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2421,"ExifImageLength":3805,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1010,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1010","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I am very respectfully\nYour Obedient Servant\n(signed) E.

Carroll & yourself at the agency one week from that time, the 29th of this month, for the purpose of holding a conference on the subject of your mission. The people did not deem it expedient for them to take any step on the suggestion, because there was a constituted authority duly authorized by the whole Cherokee people to represent their interests and to attend to the public affairs of the nation;- and, I regret to say, that the shortness of the time you fined upon, made it impossible for the chiefs & the representatives of the Cherokee people to meet you: Carroll at the time & place you suggested. The great fatigue they had undergone in attending  the election so remotely from the place of holding the general council of the nation, and the agency House, - and the consequent privation which they experienced from the very unexpected & seemingly unnecessary delay in bringing the election to a close, by their exposure to rains, hunger, & in circumstances in connection with the fact that their crops of corn having not, as yet, been generally laid by,- which, when duly considered by the commissions, I cannot doubt will be properly appreciated. Permit me to assure, sir, that it would have given the chiefs and the representatives of the Cherokee people pleasure, had it been practicable for them to have met and taken their old friend & brother soldier, His excellency gov.

In order therefore that the facts in relation to this transaction may be correctly known, I embrace the earliest opportunity to address you on the subject, and respectfully to inquire whether this report be true or not? And if correct, then to be informed by what authority or justification you have been then prompted  to seize this rightful property of the nation? What the object in view is, for having it done? And what disposition is intended to be made of the property? It may be proper to add that the General Council of the Nation, which was held at Red Clay in the court of the last Spring adopted a resolution directing me to have this property removed from New Echota, and that in pursuance of which, I had employed a waggon & team to carry it into effect; but the waggoner engaged in this service arrived at New Echota about two hours after this unexpected and very singular seizure was made on the property, as herein stated. \nI am, Gentlemen, respectfully,\nYour obedient servant\nJno [John] Ross [Principal] Chief, CN [Cherokee

You gave the press into the hands of your brother in law, Elijah Hicks, who was completely under your dictation; and it was prostituted to party politics among yourselves; misleading the common people & prejudicing their minds against some of the best and most patriotic members of the tribe, because they would no longer submit to your dictation.

He dismounted, apparently in a great hurry, and commanded the whole company to be ready to march in five minutes. This created considerable excitement among the Guard & prisoners.

We supposed that the Federal Troops at the command of Major Curry would meet the Georgia Guard under the command of Col. Bishop, at the 35th degree of North Latitude, where we would, in perfect accordance with Georgia Unionism, + Jackson Federalism, be delivered up, in true military style, to Uncle Sam.

After breakfast, bailiff Smyth, one of the Guard, served the warrants upon us, and we were ordered to go into the Colonel's room.

If we had sinned against the laws of the State, was not the civil authority fully competent to bring us to justice? Had we ever defied or resisted a civil process? - No. - Why, then, should the civil authority be superceded by the military? And why were we marched off, in great military parade, about 56 miles from the county in which it is pretended we had rebelled? And, again, why keep us in lawless and false imprisonment 10 or 12 days, and trail & dodge about through the forests and swamps of the surrounding country, in order to deceive and triumph over the civil officers of the country? But this is not all. Is it fair & honorable that we should be compelled to give bonds for our appearance at court, previous to an investigation of the matter? Strange, indeed, that we should be compelled to submit to a government & then be denied the most common privileges of that government! We ask, again, what meaneth all this?\nHaving been for some time past, an eye witness of the strange manoeuvring and crooked course of certain dear creatures in this country, I will attempt an explanation of this marvellous affair. Be it known, then, that the Cherokees, under existing circumstances, are capable of committing three kinds of sins; namely, legal sins, party sins and policy sins; or, in other words, sins against the law, sins against the party, and sins against the darling policy. Sinners of the first class, in many instances, obtain forgiveness by submitting to the party or policy, but it seems there is no mercy for the two latter, neither in his Excellency at Milledgeville nor in his Majesty at the White House. Now, although it is very difficult for a Cherokee to breathe in this country without transgressing one or other of the many exterminating laws of 1831-2-3- or 4, yet, every body knows that we have not violated any law in this matter.

and Moses Daniel, Secretary of Naitonal Council, presenting to be an answer to any communication to you of the 14th inst. after receiving this communication, I sent a sealed message to these gentlemen by the unclear: Conest Underwood requesting a personal interview with them. He called on the principle chief for that purpose who I understood declined the interview. It was my intention to have had a free and full conversation with them, on the subject of a Treaty, and satisfied them as to my authority, to act as a commissioner and to arrange with their Chiefs the most acceptable manner of bringing our business before the people. Since this opportunity has not been unclear me, I take the liberty to address you again in reference to this communication. The independent State Government organized by the Cherokees within the terriorial limits of the States of Georgia, No. Carolina, Tennessee and Alabama; under the constitution adopted by them, in 1827; and by which the Executive and National Council and National Committee are constituted and the poeples now unclear there Council and Committee hold office has never been recognized by these states, as is evident by their extension of the laws over the Indians. Neither has it ever been recognized by the United States; but on the contrary, the Cherokees have been expressly informed at the time of this organization by the late President of the United States the unclear John L. Adams that this act of theirs was contrary to the constitution and laws of the United States; and therefore it could not be done. Moreover, it is believed a majority of those who composed the convention that formed the Cherokee constitution were citizens of the United States, as is evident from the accompanying document marked A. Some of the officers of this Cherokee Government, at present are persons who as citizens of the United States have been chosen and acted as magistrates, military officers, legislators within the States and have exercised the election unclear within the last year. The commissioners are therefore instructed as follows: \"As the application will be made to the Cherokee people assembled for that purpose, the Commissioners will not recognize any other authority.

Cherokee Agency E. Sept. 15. 1835. Sir, I know the deep interest you feel in behalf of the Cherokees and your anxiety on their account, that they should accept of the liberal propositions for a treaty submitted to them by the direction of the President of the United States. I am confident all this would have been done before now and the existing difficulties between them and the United States adjusted to the satisfaction of great advantage of the common people, had it not been for the improper inferference and undue influence exercised over them by a few persons who have very little Inidan blood in them, but who, by the means of of a little education and the wealth obtained under former treaties have been able so to manage affairs as to deprive the common Indians of their rights and to asume the whole power, wealth and authority of this nation into their own hands. The persons to whom I allude are the Reservees and old enrolled emigrants under the treaties of 1817 and 1819.

Sir John Ross, from the cautious manner in which he expresses himself in this notice to the Agent, it is evident understood well the terms of the Treaty and reluctantly gave the stipulated notice required fearing it might cause him trouble hereafter.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71357,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/71357","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/88ffd987655f66b7a377cc0a2f51573d.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/88ffd987655f66b7a377cc0a2f51573d.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/88ffd987655f66b7a377cc0a2f51573d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/88ffd987655f66b7a377cc0a2f51573d.jpg"},"added":"2018-04-02T13:58:40+00:00","modified":"2020-04-10T01:51:02+00:00","filename":"88ffd987655f66b7a377cc0a2f51573d.jpg","authentication":"fd154edf38abcbb02fb8cea9fe2967ce","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL07_FL013_00012_o2 copy.jpg","size":886331,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2841,"compression_ratio":0.057773801608719},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["133947+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["133947+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["133947+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"88ffd987655f66b7a377cc0a2f51573d.jpg","FileDateTime":1522677478,"FileSize":886331,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2841\"","Height":2841,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2841,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:16:48","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5648},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 13:39:47","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 13:39:47","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":46,"SubSecTimeDigitized":46,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2841,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1058,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1058","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"hereafter, if he continued to reside and exercise authority among the Cherokees.

About this time the National Committee and Council passed the following law to silence opposition to their measures. \"Resolved by the National Committee and Council that any person or persons whatever who shall be forced guilty of forming unlawful meetings with the intent to create faction, against the peace and tranquility of the people; to encourage rebellion against the laws and government of the Cherokee Nation, shall receive one hundred strikes on the bare back.\" This was the first thing around the Template:Unclear of Georgia and led her to adopt the measures she has since pursued. And the Cherokee people may justly attribute all their difficulties to the ambition and low of power in there reserves who organized and carried into effect this new government. With this view, no doubt, to prevent an adjustment of difficulties between the United States and the Cherokee, which arose in consequence of the measures

We must therefore leave it for mere important matters. Mr Schereshorn as you will perceive, has not yet exhibited satisfactory credentials to prove that he is endowed with full power to make a final Treaty. He admits that the Treaty already submitted may be considered as rejected by the people, but he has proposed no substitute although he persists in declaring that some Treaty upon the basis of that which he is aware has been rejected, is the only one which will be received.

The General Government of the United State has been swayed by agents of its own, who do not enter into the feelings of our nation and who adopt a course in reference to it which has made the nation distrustful.

I write in pain, which must be my apology for this short communication as well as for the ommision to write you heretofore.

which you have expressed for a happy and a prompt termination of our negotiation with your government here upon the council Ground, should not have resulted in a manner more in harmony with your own

You have done right in stating to them explicitly, and you will repeat the assurance, that no delegation from them will be received here, and that no treaty will be listened to, unless, made in accordance with the terms heretofore offered, and specified in the letter of the Acting Secretary of War, of 25th May last.

Number than ten thousand souls. the gaine of course is gone and therefore the land would be our unclear to you but if this was not the case, the white people could not be removed.

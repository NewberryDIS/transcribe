The Missourians made their appearance a little after daylight last Saturday morning. They shot F. Brown, about 11\/2 miles west of town which was the first signal that they were upon us. The enemy numbered about 320. To oppose this force there were only about 30 Free State men in the contest. The enemy had 2 cannons. Our men only their rifles and shot guns. North of the town is a girt? of timber lining the Marais des Cygnes river. Among the underbrush in this timber commanding the entrance to the town from the west our men posted themselves. There they maintained the unequal contest for half an hour. The cannons were aimed too high. When our men saw the flash from these deep mouthed thunderers they stooped down and the murderous grape whistled and crashed in the leaves and branches overhead. But the disparity was too great. Our brave men were compelled to retreat across the river. Now was a perilous time. They had to cross the river and climb a steep bank right under the enemy's fire.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":35182,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/35182","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/a5dcd2aae2406777ae961a69bd0e4afc.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/a5dcd2aae2406777ae961a69bd0e4afc.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/a5dcd2aae2406777ae961a69bd0e4afc.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a5dcd2aae2406777ae961a69bd0e4afc.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T18:46:16+00:00","modified":"2020-05-11T19:35:19+00:00","filename":"a5dcd2aae2406777ae961a69bd0e4afc.jpg","authentication":"fb9de4b25f7558593c6028dea16935a3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_02_fl_117_008_02_o2.jpg","size":1274440,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2346,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050299958952985},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["044355"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160302"],"DigitalCreationTime":["044355"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["044355"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160302"],"DigitalCreationTime":["044355"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["044355"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160302"],"DigitalCreationTime":["044355"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a5dcd2aae2406777ae961a69bd0e4afc.jpg","FileDateTime":1507747562,"FileSize":1274440,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2346\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2346,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:06:15 11:58:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:02 04:43:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:02 04:43:55","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":30,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":151,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/151","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Some crossed at a narrow ford.

But the great majority, thank God, got across with their lives.  The unknown then returned and fired the town. So far as learned 2 of our men were killed in the action and 2 wounded - flesh wounds. There were also 2 killed and one severely wounded as they were coming in before the action. Two or three as yet missing - we hope they may yet be alive but fear they are in the river some at least. Our men estimate the loss of the enemy in killed and wounded as from 18 to 30. They took away three wagon loads of killed and wounded. \nSome families lost all they were worth in the world by the burning of the town. Others will suffer who are depending on their labor for support. I have related stern facts. I cannot moralize upon them. We have the man who was wounded most severely in our house.

The land office closes for pre-eemption the 1st of November. All land not pre-empted before that time will be forfeited. I suppose you have seen cousin Thomas D Lewis by this time and he has told you how he saw to our unclear and needs. I do not hear anything from my mail? money. I have written unclear to the Department to know if they have paid the Contractor but do not get any answer, as yet. I have very little time to write as my fall work is pressing and I am hindered a good deal with the baby, who is still sick, but better than he has been. Sarah's health has been poor; but she feels better today. My health has been rougher? the last two months than any time since the first season in Kansas. But I begin to feel right again now. This has been rather a sickly season here, that is since the middle of July. Frank has been very healthy, which is a great blessing. Crops are abundant. There is not much sale for anything now except for products of the dairy and meat. Butter is 20 cents a pound. We tried making a cheese a little while but with our three cows we could do better with butter. We are drying one for beef, so we only milk two now.

When I last wrote home I was expecting to be home by this time. But I have lingered here from one day to another, not likeing to give up the wate, until I felt myself more improved than I have as yet. My health is better than it was when I came here, but I feel yet far from well. Mrs. unknown, the lady who has acted as the physician to this establishment, left for N.Y. last Friday. Before she went I had quite a conversation with her about my case, and she wrote me some directions to follow after I went home. Afterwards I rode with her and other companions to PIttsfield (7 miles) where they were going to meet the cars. Our road lay over the mountains, and I thought I would like to have a short sleigh ride & enjoy the mountain air. Yesterday I got a note from Mrs. G? enclosed in a letter to her mother, who is here. In it she gave me some additional advice. She says she has thought much of my case since she let. She considers my case more difficult and delicate than she did when I first came. She writes, \"I wish you could come to Dr. [Shew?]] for a few weeks. I think it would be the best thing you could do. .. .. I feel anxious that your unknown be for a few weeks where you can have good & experienced medical advice. I will do all I can for you if you can come here, and I shall to? expect unknown unknown, but not here\" (i.e. at Dr. Shew] -- Dr. Shew is the editor of the \"Water Cure Journal,\" and has published two works on hydrotherapy. I have made up my mind that I will go to N.Y. and start tomorrow. If I could I would consult you first. But I cannot. If I thought that you would be unwilling for me to take this step I should be very unhappy. But I feel it very important for me to get my health.

They own between 5 and 6000 acres of land. They possess every thing in common. I have been over to see them in my walks a number of times since I have been here. There is an appearance of great comfort and great neatness about their dwellings. They have been practicing the water cure there about a year and a half. I was over there yesterday with Dr. unknown last name and saw Philemon Stuart, the Shaker that introduced it there. He had been a practising physician on the old plan for a number of years, and I was told by one of our neighbors here that had been quite successful both among them and among others. He had been troubled himself with hereditary scrofula from infancy. He also had had catarrh of the unknown description for 15 years. His digestion is now that he obliged to take digestive pills before every meal. I'm unknown he said that 18 months ago he seemed as himself a complication of all diseases that humanity was liable to. About that time he obtained possession of Capt. Claridge's book, (the same that Mr. Edwards of Floyd has,) and as he had tried every other remedy without success, he thought he would try water, and he tried it very thoroughly according to the directions in that book.

A young man not over thirty. He took out his books last night. I noticed in looking over the few he had with him that about half were religious work such as Hist of Reformation Wesley's Sermons &c.

I believe we have been pretty negligent writers lately.  The rennets? from Uncle Henry came to hand in good season.  We are very much obliged to uncle for sending such a noble lot.

This is not a mistake, for Mr. Burritt speaks of these as variable stars. Then in the head of Cetus (the Whale) Mr. Burritt speaks of a remarkable pentagon of stars.

At half past four it began to rain, and rained all Wednesday night and all day Thursday.  The snow moved off as the night secedes at the approach of the sun.  It was very fortunate that we got our stones drawn before the snow went off as it will enable us to get our building done, I think, at least a month earlier.  This is one advantage to us from a tardy spring.

We have had a very busy time here these last few days with our new building.  The cellar was completed yesterday. The frame will be put up in the beginning of the week.  We have had nine men at work here part of the time this week, - masons, carpenters, &c., besides our regular family. There are now two carpenters at work here, and a laborer whom we have hired for a month. My orchard is getting along pretty well, allowing for the unfarmable weather. The weather has been quite unfavorable for newly-planted trees, since they were planted. Some of them have leaved out nicely, others are just struggling into life, and some show no signs of life. I think I shall lose some trees. But I can \"try again.\" Some of my trees have blossomed. I do not mean to let them perfect any fruit this year. I shall break off either the blossom or the young fruit for the purpose of farming the growth of the trees. The trees in the old orchard have some blossom buds on them.  I think we shall have some fruit from them this year. The currant bushes hang gloriously full of blossoms. They evidently mean to make a show and create a decided sensation this summer.

They must have struck down when they came to the side of the house, which is the reason I did not breathe them. Only the advance flame could have reached me, for I felt nothing when I got to the door. But I know nothing only by reasoning and reflection, for I did not know I was burned till I got out of doors.

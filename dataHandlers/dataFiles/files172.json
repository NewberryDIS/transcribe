They are well & so are their children.  They enquired kindly for you.  Madam Paine & Katie are still East.  I think a great deal about your journey home.  It will be very hard for you at best.  I wish I felt able to go East & return with you but I am afraid to.  I am aware you do not think I should run any risk, or of course you would not wish me to do so, for of course you are as anxious to have me live as I am to live & would regard my death as a great calamity to you & the children.  My experience the last time I went East & also my recent experience in riding in the cars makes me dread a journey very much.  Perhaps my fears are groundless.  I fear also that it will do you harm.  Perhaps you can arrange so as to stop at Albany with Mrs. Lee & at Buffalo with Mr. Hartzell's folks in case Lydia returns with you & then by taking the sleeping car from Buffalo you will not get as tired.  If I go with you I shall not think of going through without stopping.  I wish you & I were both well but we are not.  You will get so tired coming out.  David said to-day he would pay 10 dollars towards my expenses East if I would stop in N.Y. City and see some men there for him.  I would not hesitate a moment to go East & return with you did I not so dread the effect of the journey.  For I do want to see Sarah & George in their home & sister Lydia & then I know it would be easier for you even if Lydia did return with you.  I may yet overcome my fears enough to make the attempt.  Mr. Paine said if he was in my place he should not dare undertake it.  It did not rain last night as i wrote you I fear it would.  It has been quite cold to day & is to-night.  I should enjoy so much to have you with me to night to snug close up to me & to give me some of your sweet kisses.

How is he now Do you think that there will be less danger of the children being sick in New England than there will be down on our farm. I should be glad to have you & the children with me , very glad indeed but if you think that you &  they will be less likely to be sick with summer complaints in New England than on the farm I want you should remain where you are till cool weather. I shall start for the farm in the morning & shall attend church in Chicago tomorrow & go to Kankakee City to-morrow night. While on the farm I will examine the carpets & put camphor amongst them & try & leave things as safe as I can. I intend to drive the horses up here & turn them out for a couple of months. If possible I want to fix up & put a cover on to our large buggy, for if we live in the country, we need a family carriage very much. It will cost $100 but it will be worth after it is done $225 so carriage makers tell me. It must be painted any way. About painting our house I think when we get down there we can live in the part that Morical's folks are now occupying while the other part is being painted & then we can move into the other part while that part is being painted. We shall of course do our cooking in the Wood House. What do you think of this. I think I can have our buggy fixed this month & next month earn enough to paint our house & get provisions etc. for us to commence living provided Chandler can let you have money enough to get what things you want for yourself & the children & to pay your fare out here.

I expected that they would have the flax all all threshed & hauled away & sold so that I could have got some money to have sent to you.  I want you to get a Merino dress & have it made at once for when I get back I want you ready to visit with me at the cape & elsewhere.  I want when you have your dress made you should have it made high up in the neck for two reasons.  1st your throat troubles you & I think if you could have your undershirts made high in the neck & your dresses high in the neck you would find it quite beneficial.  2nd I think you look much better with high necked dresses.  I want to get some pressed flannel & have you some undershirts made with a band around the neck & I want some for myself in the same way.  I think our throats would be benefited much by it.  Chilly damp air causes your throat to fill up very much as mine does & I know I derive great benefit from having something around my neck & then I want draws made for you as I have mine but made of flannel & enough underclothing to keep you warm so that you can go out cold or not & I want good thick protection for your feet.  They say they do not suffer from cold at Minneapolis, but they dress much warmer.  I find it necessary clear cool nights to put on extra underclothing.  I have on a flannel shirt, one of those night shirts & a fine shirt.  I find I must do it or I take cold.  It has been so damp they have not threshed the flax at least Mr Vine has not.  Martin had threshed his & hauled it away, he has gone with the last load to day to Kent.  I have not seen him yet.

I wish I could see you & talk over with you about Minnesota & elsewhere. We must decide soon where we will spend the winter. Mr Gale thought we had better come up there say the 1st of Oct, & try the climate. I do not know. He said by giving him 3 weeks notice he could rent for us a comfortable house for from 25 to 30 dollars a month. He saw many come there & derived great benefit, in faith got quite comfortable. I met many who went there with hemorrhages & who say they have had none there & feel quite well. I have heard of others who run right down I am inclined to think the climate would do you good & perhaps it would me. It would make the children vigorous I think. There is no ague in that part of Minnesota they tell me. I know of no place outside of the suburbs of Boston where I would as soon live if I could as in Minneapolis. They raise no applies there. The winter kills the trees. In Wisconsin they have an abundance of apples. Minneapolis market is well supplied with fruit brought from the south. Southern & central Ill. is the fruit garden of the world. Chicago Market is flooded with fruit. Mr. Butt's folks said we could get good board in Minneapolis during the winter for 6 dollars a week & Eddie, Winnie & George, half price & Artie nothing they thought. Board in the winter is much cheaper than in the summer as the pleasure seekers are gone. This would make our board 21 dollars a week besides our washing. They said we could live much cheaper than that if we rented a house. If we should conclude to go there to spend the winter, perhaps we better board till we see how the climate affects us. Board in Asheville N.C. in Getchels institution is 7 dollars a week, but I was told in Chicago we could rent good houses for 10 dollars a month & every thing in the eating line was cheap but it was difficult to get beef. We could live there probably much cheaper than in Minneapolis but could not board as cheap & we should not want to move our things till we know how the climate effected us. I am inclined to think you need a bracing atmosphere & if so Minneapolis is the place. In the summer the seaside would be good for you if you need bracing air. Doct.

Health is & ought to be the first consideration. I hope it will be so that we can have our homes near each other. So far as you & I are concerned, it would be for our pecuniary interest to live in Kankakee till we could dispose of this farm & our lots in K.  But the next question is would it be for our health.

I am anxious to live for your & the children's sake but it does not seem to me that there is any thing else worth living for that is within my reach. My health cuts me off from all active exertion in the literary or religious world. I wish I could be better & you could be well. If Western North Carolina will make us well it will pay us to go there even if it takes all we have to situate ourselves there. In your good letter of sympathy you said that we both know very well that had we taken our choice we should not have neglected our dear little Artie for the sake of saving this property here.

I am not well. If I could get such food as I need I think I could get along. It does not seem to me as if I can stand it any longer, but I suppose I shall have to. There is but one corn sheller in the country & I cannot get that till two weeks from to-morrow & it will take till that time to get the corn picked over. It will take a week to shell it & haul it away. You say there will be property enough left to make us comfortable. Of course there is. There is more left than you thought we had when we went into Kankakee to live. We thought then we should be satisfied if we could have 13000  dollars left. We now have saved over 5000 dol. from old farm & those lots in Kankakee 2000 & this farm is worth 7000, the old corn about 500, our share of when all sold about 300, we have 4 horses worth at least 500 dollars, 2 buggies, Reaper, Rake, old Wagon, 3 plows, a con cultivator, corn planter, harnesses, saddle, etc. all worth 500. Martin owes for old horses 125, & for feed for them about 40. Mr. Vain owes something on account for feed for teams & also corn got by his wife's father, & corn sold by him.

I often think that I have been unkind in not answering the letter which your cousin Mary had the kindness to send me soon after your visit to Boston. But not being an adept in the art of letter-writing, and being deficient in the \"gift of gab\" as it is commonly called, (though I must confess not a very refined term,) I felt very delicate in writing one for fear it would not be exactly to the purpose. But I have laid aside those feelings of restraint in a measure, and have this evening concluded that I would write something if it is not quite so bright; though to tell the truth I suppose I should not have written now if mother had not requested me to. It is a long time since we have seen each other; and I suppose we have changed in appearance, if not in feeling. I hope we may before long have the pleasure of seeing you again in Boston, accompanied by your mother. I have always had a great desire to see her, as she bears I have been told a striking resemblance to my Grandmother.  I have also heard my mother speak of the many pleasant hours she has passed in her society. I hope that I may ere long be permitted to visit your home in Warwick, and also the places that were familiar to mother in her youthful days.

Thursday 25th. I have just returned from school having supplied the place of a teacher who is absent. I have as yet obtained no permanent situation. I sometimes get discouraged and think there is no luck for me. I will now inform you why I have written. Last Sunday Mr. Gray informed me that you had received no intelligence from your brother Charles for some time, and that you were very much distressed on his account. I thought if the little information of which I am possessed, (although it is some time since I received it, and you may have heard from him since then,) would relieve your minds any, I would give it you. Last summer Aunt Sarah received letters from her husband, and in one of them he mentioned, that in his travels he had met with your brother at one of the mines. He was then well and seemed in very good spirits. I hope however that you will soon hear from him, and be relieved of your anxiety. Perhaps he may be like a young man whom I met last summer at my Aunt's. He had neglected writing so long, that he thought at last it would be of no use to write. His friends were very anxious about him, and came to the conclusion that he must be dead when suddenly to their great joy and surprise he made his appearance. I hope that it may prove this in your case. We did not know that Charles had gone to California, until he had been there sometime. We were informed of it by some of our friends from the country. When you write, (which I hope you will soon,) you must tell us all about him, and if he is doing well, and how long he intended to be gone. Tell us about the rest of your family, and about yourselves, and every thing that you think we shall take an interest in. I suppose now you would like to hear from your friends down this way. But allow me to say to you before I commence, that I feel more acquainted with you now, than when I commenced writing.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40209,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/40209","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/6ddc66da5d1b08d0833ed23ca71f88f6.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/6ddc66da5d1b08d0833ed23ca71f88f6.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/6ddc66da5d1b08d0833ed23ca71f88f6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6ddc66da5d1b08d0833ed23ca71f88f6.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T16:14:15+00:00","modified":"2020-05-17T03:10:15+00:00","filename":"6ddc66da5d1b08d0833ed23ca71f88f6.jpg","authentication":"e03e9bde5d38d479e7416797b60c582a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_021_001_03_o2.jpg","size":1588492,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2817,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.052212492933118},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["034531"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["034531"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["034531"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6ddc66da5d1b08d0833ed23ca71f88f6.jpg","FileDateTime":1509379737,"FileSize":1588492,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2817\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2817,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:18 16:02:28","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:18 03:45:31","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:18 03:45:31","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":79,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3237,"ExifImageLength":4136,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":172,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/172","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Our family are all in health, and our three boys very active. Grandfather is much better than we ever expected him to be. He is at present with Aunt Esther, in North Chelmsford, but we expect him down here, when the weather is sufficiently warm to enable him to come without any inconvenience. Aunt Sarah resides in Somerville and has a very pleasant place. Uncle Paige returned from California last December, after having been absent nearly two years. He remained at home about two months, and then left again for the \"Golden Region\". I will take the opportunity now of saying to you, lest I should forget it, that I will request Aunt Sarah when she writes, to ask Uncle Paige if he will make inquiries concerning your brother. I have also two cousins at the mines, and I will request the same favor of their friends when they write. Aunt Abby resides in E. Boston. I have not been over there this winter as the going has been so bad. Aunt Harriet still lives in Concord. We hear from them very often as Uncle Stewart comes down every fortnight, and occasionally I receive letters from the girls. Charlotte taught school last summer in Tyngsboro. I believe she did not like as well as she thought she should, and come to the conclusion that she would not attempt teaching again, at least for two or three years. Uncle John lives in the same place that he did when you were here. He has also had an addition to his family, of a girl and boy. The girl is about four years old, and a little beauty I assure you. The boy is about two months old. Uncle Sumner lives in Cambridgeport. I suppose Uncle Samuel lives in Springfield. We have not heard from him since Grandfather was there last summer.

I saw Mr. Gray, and he intends giving Aunt Sarah a letter, requesting her to have Uncle Paige make inquiries about your brother.

Then again we were very busy in making preparations for Charles to go to California; Charles gone to California! I can almost hear you exclaim. Yes! That little boy you saw when you were here, has gone to seek his fortune in the \"Golden Region\". And if you will believe me, I came very near going; so near that I purchased a travelling dress, and went to Somerville to inform the gentleman with whom I was going that I had decided to accompany him. Aunt Sarah & her two children have gone, and have probably arrived at San. Francisco, before now, as they left on the 21st of June. Now I will explain to you why I thought of going. Last winter when Uncle Paige was at home, he exacted from me a promise, that I would go to California provided Aunt Sarah should go. I thought I was quite safe in making my promise on that condition, as there was no probability that she would ever go. Well! Last May what must he do but send for his family and also for Charles & myself. I was some time in making up my mind, and I finally concluded to go; but I found father rather objected to it, and I thought best to relinquish the idea.

We felt very badly when the time came for parting; Aunt Sarah & Charles kept up very good spirits until, they gave the parting word which brought tears into all eyes. Charles is young to go so far away from home and in the midst of so many temptations, but we do not fear to hurt him as he is a boy of good principles; and then he will be in Aunt Sarah's family, where he will have good influences around him. We received a letter from Aunt Sarah while she was at Panama.  She writes she was seasick but a very little, Anna was sick but a few hours, David not at all, and Charles more so than either. After they had been four days out David had one of his fits, caused I suppose by the excitement. She had a very gentle mule, but Charlie's was rather obstinate, and was determined not to go unless compelled to, and for that reason he did not arrive at the other side of the Isthmus as soon as Aunt did. Now I will give you some account of her journey across the Isthmus, although it will be brief, as she did not give a very minute description, but I suppose we shall have the particulars when Charles writes which I hope will be soon. In the first place her saddle tuned, which let her gently down upon her back in a nice soft place; you must imagine as we did what that \"nice soft place\" was. Her saddle made sure she again mounted, and proceeded  on her journey. She says if you raise your imagination to its highest pitch in regard to crossing the Isthmus, you can scarcely conceive of anything as bad- you go through rivers, over mountains, into mud holes, down steep declivities, and through narrow passes; and I think that is about as much as I should wish to go through. In some parts of her Journey she was obliged to sit astride of the mule as it would have been impossible for her to have travelled otherwise. When I think of the length of time they intend to be gone, (which is five years) I feel sad, for I think of the many changes that may take place, and the probability that we may never meet again on earth; bit it is my earnest prayer that we may have our lives & health spared to us, and that we may again be permitted to enjoy each other's society, as we have in days that are past.

It was Mr. Mansfield, a partner of Uncle Paige's. He came on to visit his family, and Uncle Paige thought it would be an excellent opportunity for Aunt S. to return with him. He felt perfectly sage to trust Aunt S. with him as he had travelled the route several times. Aunt Sarah wrote that he took the best of care of David when he had his fit, and that he had treated them all in a very gentlemanly manner, for which she should always respect him. Charles was very happy and in good spirits, she writes, which is certainly cheering news for us as we expected he would be entirely disheartened, and homesick. I have spoken only of these friends who have left us in the expectation of returning; but there is one who has left us never to return; it is my aged Grandfather. He passed away very gently on Saturday the 12th of June, about 20 minutes past nine in the evening. We had been here but one week when he died. We moved here for the purpose of taking care of him, but he did not want our care long. He was confined to his bed but three days previous to his death, although he ought to have been there several weeks before he was, but he seemed very ambitious to keep up as long as it was possible for him to rise. Uncle John came here and took care of him six weeks, and he was obliged to carry him as if he had been a child. The night before his death, mother & Aunt Sarah watched with him, and he would frequently say though with great effort, \"The Shadow of Death\". We thought he might have been thinking of the passage of Scripture, where it speaks of passing through the dark valley of the shadow of death. The afternoon of his death, he thought he should like some honey. I went into the city to procure some for him, but before I returned with it, he was dying, and not able to take any. I then went directly back for Uncle John; but he was unable to return with me, as his business was such that he could not leave then. When I returned his eyes were closed, but I think he knew I was there, as his hearing returned before he died. While I had gone for Uncle John, he took his last farewell of his friends. When father entered the room he took his hand (being unable to speak) and gave it a firm pressure, he then took the hand of mother, and pressed it to his lips several times; when he took Aunt Sarah's hand he retained it for some time. He looked at each of the children and then closed his eyes upon this world forever. I regret very much that I was not present at the time. But never shall I forget the scene that presented itself to my view, when I entered the room, after my return. There he lay gasping for breath, with the hand of my mother upon his forehead, the hand of Aunt Sarah within his own, and the children standing around, weeping as if their little hearts would break. O! it was such a sad scene indeed, and I cannot refrain from weeping whenever I recall that scene. I knew that he is far happier than he could be here but I should have been pleased, could he have been spared to us a little longer. I cannot realize that he has gone from us forever, it seems as though he must return again. His remains were conveyed to Concord, and deposited in Uncle Stewart's tomb. He looked very natural after he died; Mother thought he resembled Aunt Emily very much, as he lay in his coffin.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40214,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/40214","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/625bccf787ba0f1a9e187aed25e2a4af.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/625bccf787ba0f1a9e187aed25e2a4af.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/625bccf787ba0f1a9e187aed25e2a4af.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/625bccf787ba0f1a9e187aed25e2a4af.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T16:14:31+00:00","modified":"2020-05-17T04:09:01+00:00","filename":"625bccf787ba0f1a9e187aed25e2a4af.jpg","authentication":"76bc5ed110732aeb734252d2e1722899","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_021_002_04_o2.jpg","size":1758388,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2875,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.056630853462158},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["034635"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["034635"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["034635"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"625bccf787ba0f1a9e187aed25e2a4af.jpg","FileDateTime":1509379737,"FileSize":1758388,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2875\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2875,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:18 16:02:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:18 03:46:35","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:18 03:46:35","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":79,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3286,"ExifImageLength":4114,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":172,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/172","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"You mentioned in your letter that you had received no new of your brother Charles for a year last Nov. I think if he is living it must be owing to his habit of procrastination that he has not written: for he was very much given to that habit when he boarded with us. He would frequently say he must write home, and that would be the last of it for some time. I hope, however, you have heard from him before this time. I had a cousin leave the 5th of May for California. He was going to meet his brothers who were there, at Bidwell Bar on Feather River. I thought as that was the river on which your brother had been located, they possibly might know something about him, or perhaps be fortunate enough to meet with him; I therefore wrote your brother a letter informing of the anxiety you felt in not hearing from him; and requested my cousin if ever he should meet with him, to deliver it to him. But unfortunately he neglected to take the letter with him. I was sorry it did not go, but I know if ever he should see him, he will let us know when he writes to his friends, Uncle Paige also wrote, that he would endeavor to obtain some information concerning him. You wrote you anticipated visiting is in the fall; I hope you have fully decided to come, and your mother also, and make us a good visit. Now do come won't you? say yes do. Aunt Reed you must certainly say yes for yourself. I should like also to see Mary very much. I should be glad to see all the family, but I suppose as it would not be convenient for all to come I must be contented with seeing a part. Mother too would be very much pleased to see you; and I hope we shall have the pleasure of seeing you soon. I wish you would come now while it is my vacation. It commenced  last Monday and we are to have six weeks. Mother & I went to E. Boston last Friday, and spent the day with Aunt Abby. Hiram obtained a Franklin Medal, at the annual Exhibition. We are now residing at Somerville in Aunt Sarah's house, but it is uncertain whether we shall remain longer than fall or not. We can stay until next April, and I hope matters will be arranged that we can remain until they return from California. I should like to live here always it is so pleasant. I go into the city every day in the cars (which I like very much,) to school. The house is very pleasantly situated, and we have a very extensive view of the neighboring towns. We have quite a little farm too. Father has plated a few vegetables, and we have a cow, and three hens, and in the course of a week or two, we shall have some chickens- O! I enjoy living here very much. There is one thing that I must tell you about; and it is this: Uncle & Aunt Stewart are strong believers in the \"Spiritual Rappings,\" of which I presume you have heard so much. They are quite spiritual of late. I really wish you could hear them talk,- I think you would be amused. I find my sheet is nearly filled, and I must therefore bring my letter to a close. I have written at intervals, and that is the reason why you have not received it sooner after the date. When you scribe, you may direct it if you please, to the care of father, at Mr. G.W. Robinson & Cors. Lock Manufacturing No. 4 Richmond St Boston.  Please excuse bad writing and blunders. Write soon, and have Mary write also. Give my love to all the family, and reserve a share for yourself.

No I am not, but I thought very strange that you had not written me before, and since you have made such a satisfactory apology, I cannot do otherwise than excuse you for your long neglect. I am glad that you & Mary contemplate visiting us so soon and hope that you may not be disappointed. You wish to know who of our friends now reside in the city. Uncle John is the only one and lives in the same place that he did when you were here before. Aunt Abby lives at E. Boston, I am sorry on your account that we are not in the city, as it would be pleasanter for you. I think however that you will like out present place very much. If you conclude to come in the Fitchburg road, I think it will be better for you to male your visit at Uncle Stewart's first (but do not let me interfere with your arrangements).  then from there to Somerville, and some of us will be at the depot to meet you, if you will inform us of the day you intend to come. I wish you would persuade your mother to come with you, for we all wish to see her very much. I do not think there is any thing to prevent her coming as her babes are all large enough to take care of themselves. Now you do your best to have her come. I always had a great desire to see her and  I should think she might gratify me in my wish. All our friends are well except Uncle John. He has had a very severe headache for about three weeks\n\nJ3","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40222,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/40222","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/4dc2383e6b87eb1528db94bce06951ce.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/4dc2383e6b87eb1528db94bce06951ce.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/4dc2383e6b87eb1528db94bce06951ce.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4dc2383e6b87eb1528db94bce06951ce.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T16:14:54+00:00","modified":"2020-05-17T04:30:30+00:00","filename":"4dc2383e6b87eb1528db94bce06951ce.jpg","authentication":"52c44d9a398fcc0b4960923e29998c80","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_021_003_02_o2.jpg","size":1605196,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2927,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.050778701489327},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["034751"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["034751"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["034751"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4dc2383e6b87eb1528db94bce06951ce.jpg","FileDateTime":1509379737,"FileSize":1605196,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2927\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2927,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:18 16:03:04","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:18 03:47:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:18 03:47:51","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3253,"ExifImageLength":4000,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":172,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/172","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Charlotte & Fanny have been sick but they are now restored to their usual health. We hear from our friends in California every fortnight. They are very contented in their new home, and seem quite happy. Charles is with Uncle Paige, and doing finely for a boy. They bore their journey very well, much better than they expected. Charles & little David were taken with the dysentery at Panama, and to David it proved fatal. He died on the passage from Panama to San Francisco. They procured a pine box at Acapulco, and took him to San F.  When they arrived there Uncle P. was sick with a fever bit he sent his brother to meet them. I think those must have been trying times for Aunt Sarah, but she had strength given her to sustain her, in that hour of deep trial and affliction. I will not go into particulars now, as I hope soon to see you, and talk it all over.  I shall continue in school, and probably shall until I resign, or receive my \"walking ticket\" from the committee. I should like to know why Mary never writes to me? But I think I know the reason. I remember she sent me a letter once by her brother Charles and I never answered it. Now isn't that the reason? So your brother Chandler has become weary of his bachelor life, and taken unto himself a wife. Well! there is where he is right, and may long life, health, prosperity and happiness be theirs. I am sorry to learn that you have as yet received no tidings from your brother Charles. I think as you say that it would be some relief to know that he is at rest.

I have no satisfactory excuse to offer for my long neglect, and therefore will not attempt to frame any. I received last evening a package of letters from Mr. Paige, and among the number found one written to him by your brother, Charles, and which he (Mr. P.) thought I should like to send. I was very much pleased to hear from him, he more so, as I had given up all hopes of ever hearing from him again. I hope he will continue to write regularly, and never more cause you so much anxiety and distress on account of his neglect. I have some thoughts of writing to him by the next mail do you think he would like to have me? I suppose it would be impossible for one to imagine the deep and heartfelt joy, and gratitude which must have filled your hearts, when you received that letter which informed you that your dear long lost brother, was still alive and in the enjoyment of health. I should like to have you see the letter which I have - he alludes very feelingly to the death of Aunt Sarah, and dear little Anna. When you make us that long-looked for visit, you shall have the pleasure of reading it. I was at uncle Sumner's last Friday night, and they informed me of the marriage of your brother Samuel. They also told me that Caroline Belding was in consumption, and not expected to live long.\n\nJ4","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40226,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/40226","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b20eb26e290710009c6059565d9e8b3a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b20eb26e290710009c6059565d9e8b3a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b20eb26e290710009c6059565d9e8b3a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b20eb26e290710009c6059565d9e8b3a.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T16:15:05+00:00","modified":"2020-05-17T05:28:43+00:00","filename":"b20eb26e290710009c6059565d9e8b3a.jpg","authentication":"eab1eec53251f4e0cd4dec0c1280dd40","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_021_004_02_o2.jpg","size":1487164,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2870,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047979223125565},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["034816"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["034816"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["034816"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b20eb26e290710009c6059565d9e8b3a.jpg","FileDateTime":1509379738,"FileSize":1487164,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2870\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2870,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:18 16:03:15","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:18 03:48:16","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:18 03:48:16","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3178,"ExifImageLength":3986,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":172,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/172","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"We shall reside at Somerville, and like as well as at first.

This last letter to me were written to me on that steamer and when I read of the explosion I feared here it might be.

(Oh! well did I know why she asked) She then told me that the morning paper had mentioned the name of Mr Paige as among the number killed by the explosion. The next day we received letters from Charles and Mr. Gray confirming the sad tidings. They were both too and to write more than a few lines to inform as of his death. Oh! how sad I have been since receiving the mournful intelligence. We are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the next mail so that we may know more of the particulars. Mr. Gray sent me some notices of the death of Mr. Paige so that I might see how highly he was esteemed. The teachers and scholars of the Sunday School in San Fransisco where he had been Superintendent sent him a present of a silver flower vase and salver it reached Willamett on the day of his death.

A piece of iron struck him taking off the top of his head, so that all there was to be seen of his face was the nose and lower part of his face.

The funeral service was held in the Unitarian Church, Mr. Gray officiating. When they arrived at the grave the children gathered around it, and sung a hymn - they then took a farewell look of their friend, before the grave should hide him from their sight.

I am still in my school, and enjoy the society of the little ones very much usually, but sometimes I get weary of my school, and wish that I could have a little time to myself. I have lately murmured considerable at my lot, but I feel that it is sinful for me to complain of the situation in which God has seen fit to place me. I am trying to overcome those feelings of discontent, and think I have succeeded in a measure.

If Charles is at home tell him he must take his mother and come to Somerville, for we should like to see them both very much.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40242,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/40242","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/6af247fec3a6b75481d458ac4e5bdcde.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/6af247fec3a6b75481d458ac4e5bdcde.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/6af247fec3a6b75481d458ac4e5bdcde.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6af247fec3a6b75481d458ac4e5bdcde.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T16:15:49+00:00","modified":"2020-05-17T18:54:13+00:00","filename":"6af247fec3a6b75481d458ac4e5bdcde.jpg","authentication":"5e17f454a9dcfa0b50f36756d1bbf5e5","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_021_007_04_o2.jpg","size":1424016,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2922,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.045124344056582},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["035005"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["035005"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["035005"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6af247fec3a6b75481d458ac4e5bdcde.jpg","FileDateTime":1509379738,"FileSize":1424016,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2922\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2922,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"16mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:18 16:03:56","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:18 03:50:05","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:18 03:50:05","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2672,"ExifImageLength":3291,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":172,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/172","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Will you please to ask him, if he ever wrote to me, because our Charlie said he was going to.

Enjoyed my visit there very much, found Lottie the same as of old although she was assumed the titles of wife and mother. I presume Leonora told you that Lottie had a babe. He is truly a beautiful looking child. He was born the 10th of last June. And we have also another member added to our family.

I was very happy to receive a letter from him; but was sorry to learn that his health had been so poor through the Winter. I hope that when Spring returns with its mild, sunny days that he may be fully restored and again enjoy all the blessings attendant upon good health. My motive in writing at this time is to give you a little information about the Station at which you will stop. As you spoke of stopping at Somerville I thought it best to inform you that the train which you will come in does not stop at our station, but at Porter's about a mile above our stopping place. After it has stopped at P's it goes directly through to Boston. Therefore some of us will be at that station (Porter's) to meet you. I did not intend to write as much as this when I commenced, and as it is nearly time for me to leave, I will make a few closing remarks and then bid you farewell until we meet. Charles must not be disappointed because I have not enclosed a few lines for him but if he does not accompany you, I will write very soon after your arrival. Please say to him that he has my heartfelt thanks for his kind favor.

When I left you Saturday eve, I intended to have completed this epistle on the next day, but mother though I was foolish to send a letter to Concord for you not knowing whether you were there or not, and upon a little reflection I too came to that conclusion. She thought possibly that you might not go there at present as uncle and aunt were absent. Last night I had an errand to Uncle John's and his wife told me that you were there which by the way is the first information I have received of you since you left here. I expect that you and Fanny are having grand times. You must tell me all about your visit. When did you go to Concord. Last Sunday was Fanny's 25th birthday. I thought of her a great many times on that day. I presume you will soon leave for home. Mary is probably counting the days that will soon release her from her school duties. After this week, there will be three weeks more for me before vacation. The day is fast drawing to a close. I am alone in my chamber, seated by the window penning my thoughts for cousin Abby -- that they may prove acceptable to her is my sincere wish. If you were here I should talk with you, and tell you how thoughtless I was in the morning I took leave of you, and ask you to excuse me. I did not ask you to \"come again\" and not let twelve years press either before you again make your appearance. And another think I did not send my love to your friends at home, nor send an invitation for them to visit us. You will please accept the message now for them.

You express a wish that my feelings may not be changed towards him. Let me tell you Abby that the same kind regard I had for him when he was a member of our family I have now and ever shall have. His manner towards me was ever kind and at times even affectionate. And think you I can ever forget that kindness? No never. During his long absence those pleasant remembrances were often thought of, together with many thoughtless acts of unkindness on my part, which filled my heart with deep regret, and I resolved if ever we should be permitted to meet again, I would atone for my unkindness by kind deeds. I fear your mother will never think of us again as she has, but I hope she will love us a little bit if no more. Tell her that her \"poor boy\" is received as kindly as ever by all of us, and that we all have real good times when he comes. And he will himself confess to the same. My mother and father always thought and spoke well of Charles, and they are still his friends. Do not feel that any unkindness is felt or hard feelings exist towards him - for it is not so, I assure you. Why on that very night that the conversation took place,  before we retired we laughed and were as happy as people could be. Father at the commencement made a remark which made mother and myself feel very badly, and she has talked with him about it. But I think what is said when a person is vexed should be overlooked as they often make remarks which they are sorry for afterwards. You have spoken of your brother as being possessed of a noble heart. I know he has very fine feelings and I appreciate them. I have enjoyed his correspondence very much because his sentiments were very often like my own. I enjoy talking with him very much. I think I understand his nature perfectly. I know he has a kind heart and that is of much value. I have never told my mother that you knew of that affair for she would feel very badly about it. I should not be surprised however if  when she see your mother she would tell her all about it. Yes Abby my mother is going to let me visit Warwick next summer. She says we will all go together as my brother will then be here to go with us, and furthermore she says I may stay longer then she does if I wish to. I was gone three weeks this summer, although at first I did not intend to go away. I visited Clinton in company with Fanny we had a very pleasant time together. You have probably heard of the death of Charlotte's little boy. I spent two weeks with Aunt Esther- she was disappointed that you did not visit her as you first intended. While I was there we all went over to see cousin Roxana. We spent a very pleasant afternoon there  - she too was disappointed in no receiving a visit from you. While at Clinton I heard about Fanny notwithstanding she made you promise not to tell me about it. Are you teaching now? I have 70 scholars ? with an attendance of 65 and 66 which more than fulls mt seats, as I have only 60 of them. Charles and Oscar Wright called at the school one afternoon. I was very glad to see them and then I called with Charlotte only a day or two after to see Charles. Mary owe me a letter which I should be glad to get. Please give my love to her, and say to her I often think of her with pleasure. Mother and I often speak of your visit. You will come again soon will you not? and have your mother come too, for you do not know how I want to see her. Please give my love to all my Warwick friends,  yourself included, and believe me every your true and loving friend and cousin. Agnes.\n(Please destroy this - you know why)","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40269,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/40269","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d187a79cd92c8740dde30566d661bf9d.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d187a79cd92c8740dde30566d661bf9d.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d187a79cd92c8740dde30566d661bf9d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d187a79cd92c8740dde30566d661bf9d.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T16:17:17+00:00","modified":"2020-05-18T04:03:30+00:00","filename":"d187a79cd92c8740dde30566d661bf9d.jpg","authentication":"f3f630d2183ab3cc487ed46fb67875a9","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_021_014_01_o2.jpg","size":1027608,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2290,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041549733139253},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["035315"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["035315"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170718"],"TimeCreated":["035315"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d187a79cd92c8740dde30566d661bf9d.jpg","FileDateTime":1509379739,"FileSize":1027608,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2290\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2290,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"16mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:18 16:05:06","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.025,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:18 03:53:15","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:18 03:53:15","ShutterSpeedValue":5.321928,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":37,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2639,"ExifImageLength":4148,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":172,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/172","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Boston March 30th 1857\n\nMy dear cousin Abby,\n\n                         Charles was at Somerville last evening, an informed is that the should leave for home to-day or to-morrow and as I am owing you a letter, thought it would be a good opportunity to send you a few lines at least, acknowledging the receipt of your last favor and also to thank you for the same.

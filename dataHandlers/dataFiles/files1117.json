And watching thus, the little incident-that of her happy child cutting the bright flowers around her-is as a beautiful simile of one's perrusing the word of God.

She is ready to testify from experiences that there is a great deal of spiritual profit to be derived & from following out this one precept-\"Seach the Scriptures.\" She thinks that, in general, this should be the Christain's chief object as pertains to the perusal of God's holy word.

With faith to guide she urges them to read it carefully; & as the child in the gardens, culled such flowers as suited her childish tastes; so would she have them gather from the sacred Volume, those precious words of hope, strength & consolation, which will meet their every need, suit their every experience which they can safely take home to their trusting hearts.

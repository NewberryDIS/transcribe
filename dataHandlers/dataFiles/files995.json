If northern man cannot go there and take a farm because they are averse to holding slaves and if he works his farm himself he is looked upon with scorn by his neighbor who works his farm by slaves he is constantly taunted with being from white trash and it annoys him so that he leaves in disgust and moves to some country where honest labor is not looked upon as a disgrace by the nabobs of the South. This is the only reason why this beautiful and fertile state is only settled along the river shores slavery is not a paying institution there consequently there is no danger of its spreading north as many of our northern people are afraid of, nature has erected barriers against slavery more potent than any that could be enacted by Congress, as soon as slavery is abolished in Missouri then will she take her stand along with her sister states the richest and proudest of all.

We went down to the Missouri river, and took passage on board of a ferry boat for Belmont, a village on the Kansas side about five miles from St Joe. The Missouri river here is about four hundred yards wide, the water is very yellow being a mixture of about one half part of sand and water, it has a very rapid current running at the rate of about ten miles an hour. In some places it is very deep but the sand bars are all movable which makes it very dangerous to navigation.

This night we enjoyed ourselves hugely, had a good meal of stewed rabbits and prairie chickens which we killed during the day, and as the evening was cold we built a rousing fire got out our buffalo skins spread them on the grass all round the fire, and stretched ourselves at full length to rest our weary limbs.

occurrance the inflicting of immediate punishment which is the invariable rule of our society on the plains the offender being caught is instantly tried by a jury picked up on the road the witnesses both for and against are heard and if not proved he is discharged forthwith, if guilty he will be punished according to the enormity of the offense, if for horse or mule stealing or murder, he is hung to the nearest tree, if a less grevious crime he is tied to a tree or wagon wheel and receives from ten to one hundred lashes on the bare back the amount to be fixed by the jury.

This afternoon we also met the Pony Express returning from San Francisco he passed us like the wind and we could not get a single word of news we camped tonight on the Blue River again. The following day at noon we parted from this beautiful little stream having traveled fifty miles along its banks we now struck out on the broad open prairie on  the old military road to California this road has been well worn by travel it is about one hundred feet broad and cut down from the constant rise about one foot its whole width. The whole immigration to and from California in 1848 and 1850 was over this highway it is now a splendid road the peculiar nature of the soil rendering it when exposed to the sun as hard as brick without any assistance from man. It is far ahead of the smoothest Mac Adanized roads in the States a wagon loaded with six to making no impression whatever on its flinty surface tonight we had to camp on the open prairie without wood or water the prospect was not all all encouraging and we could not help contrasting it with our abundance of the night previous of the Little Blue. We pitched our tent and camped on the side of the road picketed our horses and downharted and unhappy we threw ourselves on our blankets to find some rest. This was the first time I began to think of home with many regrets for leaving it all the hardships and difficulties of our undertaking then rose before my mind vividly and I could not help thinking

curious is it that no sooner did we realize a small share of hard life than we commence to complain of what we brought [unclear] ourselves knowingly and expecting even worse than what we then experienced. The next morning we commenced our journey again about noon we came to a pool of dirty water we camped here for dinner refreshed ourselves and started again on our journey that night we camped within ten miles of the Platt River but had to spend another night without wood or water we however felt more cheereful tonight at the near prospect of relief. In the morning we rose very early and were again on the road in about three hours we struck the great Plat River at grand island ten miles below Fort Karney we were so starved out for want of cooked victals that we determined to spend the remainder of the day and night here.

We feasted gloriously today on baked bread stewed rabbit and plenty of tea and coffee we made up for the privations of the three previous days.

The Fort consists of about twenty houses occupied as barracks officers quarters and a Post Office enclosing a square about one acre with twelve six pounder guns mounted three on each side of the square what they were placed there for I could not imagine as they could not fire them off without knocking down the buildings. It is very curious why they selected such a position for a fort it has no natural advantages whatever there isnot any shlter from an enemy no elevation to the ground and it is a mile away from the river and they have not even got a mud enclosure around it and I should think in case of assault the insiders would have no advantage over the besiegers. We were not allowed to stop in the immediate neighborhood of the \"Fort\" the rules being strict that no one should camp within two miles. I staid behind to get letters I found some from home tho first I received since leaving we were as eager to get news from home as if we had been away years instead of only two weeks. I read my letters found all well at home and then went out to the square to see the drill there was two companys United States Regulars find appearing men but sadly deficient of clothing almost every man was out at the knees or elbows even the offices looked shabby I saw them trying to get gloves on which required a great deal of skill they were full of holes and the fingers would not go out in the right place.

After our supper we looked up good quarters for our poor starved horses we found a place where the grass was splendid and tied them there for the night leaving a watch to look out for their safety we then lay down and had a comfortable nights sleep.

It might with justness be called an orchard in the centre was an open space of about ten acres all around it were rows of wild apple tree commonly called \"Crab\" growing as regularly and even distances apart as if planted by the hand of man indeed I never saw straighter rows of trees in the best kept gardens of our city it was a most singular freak of nature.

directions it seemed as if the very hills sprang suddenly to life, on the came rushing at a gallop up to our very wagons we then presented our rifles and they suddenly wheeled and turned away out of

We felt that something must be done and done soon or we should be hemmed in without hope of escape it would be the hight of madness to remain in our present position so we resolved to leave it or provoke the Indians to immediate attack, so ten of our members brought in our horses harnessed them up to the wagons and made all ready for a start the other forty still kept the rifles on the cock and presented at the foe.

Indians appeared to be very friendly and well disposed towards us eager to trade skins and moccasins for anything we might offer them.  We camped this night on a prairie dog city about ten miles square they are a queer looking little animal about the size of a cat fat and plump looking, they are very numerous, all that great extent of ground is full of holes about one yard apart, it is very hard to kill one of those little creatures they are very shy and at first appearance of an enemy in their vicinity their heels twinkle in the air, and they disappear in their holes in an instant, then commences a defeaning chorous of voices all barking furiously.  It is very hard to get a shot at one of them and if you succeed in killing it the others will pull it into the hole before you can lay hold of it we used to count it a great feat to capture one of them it was only for the sport as the flesh is unfit to eat.  The most remarkable thing about these little things is the mixture of races in their family, the dog, the owl and the rattlesnake all living peacefully in the same hole I have seen them all go down together many hundred times I think it is a very strange freak of nature.  In this part of the country were a great many rabbits called here Jackass Rabbits but I am told by people that are well informed on the matter that they are the regular old country hare they are very large we succeeded in killing some and the flesh was excellent, there is a knack in hunting them which if you do not know you could not kill one in a month when one starts up before you you must stand still and then he will stand still also ang sit on his hind legs and face right towards you if he is too far off for a shot advance slowly towards him in a straight line if you go zigzag he will know it at once and start off in this way you can come close enough to shoot him if he does take the alarm and start stop still

Mr. Collyer formed one of the court he was prosecuting Attorney elected by the people.  I must say that the court there with the exception of having the sanction of the government is legitemate the officers being regularly elected by the people they are sworn to do justice to all men.  We strolled some further round the city went down and called upon the editor of the Rocky Mountain News one of the daily papers published here and had him register our names under the head of late arrivals from the States.  We purchased six copies of his paper at ten cents a copy to send home to our friend we chatted pleasantly with him for an hour or so giving him all the latest news from the States.  We then strolled round and visited some of their hotels they looked very fine for such a remote place some of them were well furnished and spread good tables at the Pacific Hotel we had supper, after that we went out again on the street to pass the time till the trial was to come off.

their pockets till it was all gone and then they cheerfully go to work for more. The next day our friend William Clancy? arrived in town he was just from the gold regions of Gregory and gave us a very gloomy picture indeed of gold mining and our prospects he advised us to sell our goods (we could then get an eneromous price for them) realize all the money we could, and start back to the States. We would not consider such a proposition for a moment he then said if we were bound to go to the mountains that the best place for us was to go the Arkansas Diggings, about one hundred and eighty miles from Denver. He said it was a new discovery reported very rich and the immigration towards that place was not very numerous as yet so that day we made up our minds to start on the next morning for the Arkansas. We made all necessary preparations and started at daylight for the mountains about fifteen miles distant. the gigantic mass of earth seemed to be raising out of the earth every step we took towards it by noon we had made only eight miles and when we camped it seemed as far off as it was in the morning its tremendous peaks covered with eternal snow hung threathiningly over our heads and were in sight hundreds of miles north and south. We stopped only a short time for dinner and took another start the country here was slighting undulating but not enough to be called hilly and preserved the same aspect to the very base of the mountains. I think that this is very remarkable for in the neighborhood of most mountains the country for fifty miles from their base is very rough and hilly but here it was nice meadow land to the very mountain

laughing by us. It was a most magnificent sight, the setting sun tinged those gloomy hights with his golden yellow the white snow seemingly about to fall upon our heads, the slopes of the mountains rising ther above thir covered with the green pine and fir tree and on the other hand lay stretched the boundless prairie that we had just traversed. Denver City was plainly in sight although fifteen miles distant, the Plat river could be seen like a silver thread winding its course along the boosom? of the prairie. We pitched our camp staked out our horses got ready some supper, and then had leisure to view the stupendous wonders, around us. It was a glorious moonlight night the air soft and warm as summer, and the mountains looked grand and wierd? looking, the scene would almost inspire one with superstition and dread. We built a large fire sat around it we did not need it as the air was warm enough but we always considered it more sociable? the prairie traveler considers it lonly not to have a fire even the hottest days in summer. We sat and talked till late the night each one related all that he had heard or read unclear that huge frowning pile before us. some told of dangers hardships and privations, of parties starting to cross them and they were never heard of afterwards. stores of wild animals and hostile Indians, till we got our imagination worked up to that pitch that we could almost imagine that those gloomy piles were peopled by evil and malignant spirits. Still if it was so it would not deter people from going there in search of the shining ore which scarcely ever brings happiness to its possessor. At a late hour in the night we lay down by our camp fire to sleep but it did not visit my eyelids for some hours after I could not close my eyes on the beautiful appearance of those mountains.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64637,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64637","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:16+00:00","modified":"2020-04-11T18:57:40+00:00","filename":"334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg","authentication":"aa86594de0feef8c39d6d615c702fc91","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00020_o2.jpg","size":849460,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2832,"compression_ratio":0.055546400920695},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102538+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102538+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102538+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg","FileDateTime":1521817599,"FileSize":849460,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2832\"","Height":2832,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2832,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:23 09:59:44","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":312},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":966,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3634},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:10:04 10:25:38","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:10:04 10:25:38","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":22,"SubSecTimeDigitized":22,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2832,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":995,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/995","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"39 I had a refreshing nights sleep and awoke in the morning about daybreak the rest of the boys were already up and busy preparing to make a start in to the mountains, but we remarked?

By this time we had all things prepared and commenced to climb the old Rockys?. we entered through a defile or mountain gulley the dried up bed of a stream there was still a small rivulet running in its lowest parts on either hand rose towering precipices that would make the eyes ache to look to their summits. The ascent was very gradual for the first two miles but a steady incline upward, at this point the mountains presented a most sublime view huge rocked piled ther above their? thousands of feet above our heads threathening at the slightest jar or puff of wind to rush resistlessly down to our destruction. Along by our feet rushed a small mountain torrent its water cold and clear as crystal refreshed our lips many times during that weary ascent, we continued on till about noon and made probably six miles on our journey. As soon as we entered the mountains we lost altogether our view of the plains our compass was the only means of knowing in what direction we were going our main course so far was southwest. At the spot where we camped for dinner there was scarcely room for our wagons unclear stand the mountains rose on both sides of us almost perpindicular the road made in the bottom was only just wide enough for one wagon. After a rest of a couple of hours we commenced to climb again the road commenced to get very rough and stony and some places very steep hills to climb so very steep that we would have to get four teams of horses to pull us up.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64638,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64638","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7283590fba7362371ba1ae152f52ecdc.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7283590fba7362371ba1ae152f52ecdc.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7283590fba7362371ba1ae152f52ecdc.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7283590fba7362371ba1ae152f52ecdc.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:17+00:00","modified":"2020-04-11T19:09:19+00:00","filename":"7283590fba7362371ba1ae152f52ecdc.jpg","authentication":"6026a020448cbc57778848aa7ce53c4c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00021_o2

It was very slow going now and shortly before sunset finding a level spot of ground we camped for the night we made only three miles this afternoon making seven crossed out nine in all and the hardest days journey we had yet performed. I was so fitugued? and wearied out that I threw myself full length upon the grass and fell asleep before supper. If this was to be a sample of a mountain road we were led to believe it was a good mountain road if so Lord help us when we got where there was no road, it was enough to make a man despair to think of having to travel one hundred and eighty miles of road worse than that, for we were informed that the first part of the road was the best. We got our supplies and then gathered some dry pine logs which were here in abundance to keep up a good fire for the night although only an hour after dark and nine miles into the mountains the indications were that we would have some frost before morning. So we started a huge fire brought out our buffalo skins and blankets and fixed our sleeping places for the night, we were obliged to sleep in the open air for we could not find level space enough to spread our tent. we pickitted our horses set the watch and things being all right lay down and took our first snooze on the Rocky Mountain. No one who has no experienced it can imagine the delicious feeling that comes over the weary traveller who has unclear up steep mountainsides all day when he throws himself down to repose at night on his harce? bed with nothing but the sky for a covering. I have lain on my back for hours watching those numberless stars ever changing their positions, the moon sailing brightly through milk white clouds, the beautiful \"milky way\" showing like a belt of silver across the sky, in this place it shows clearer and brighter than in any other part of the world, tall spires and peaks raising their snow capped peaks heavenward in all directions and on every side it is here in such a place as this that the heart turns to admiration at the skill of the wonderful creator of all these wonders.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64639,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64639","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/037ee6e7a62b215d542ea783a1be2c1a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/037ee6e7a62b215d542ea783a1be2c1a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/037ee6e7a62b215d542ea783a1be2c1a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/037ee6e7a62b215d542ea783a1be2c1a.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:18+00:00","modified":"2020-04-14T19:43:46+00:00","filename":"037ee6e7a62b215d542ea783a1be2c1a.jpg","authentication":"d9446ba275057404cbd4e16b2a91243f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00021_o2.jpg","size":869607,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

journeying about four days more the country became so mountanious that we were forced to make two parts of our loads, we built a small hut in the woods by the roadside put in about half our provisions and leaving two of our party in charge we started once more on our journey. We were now on the most elevated range of the mountains all around us was clouds and snow the air was very opprefsive after climbing a small hill you would pant like a sheep on a hot day the hight of this dividing range is about eighteen thousand feet. In the afternoon after leaving our companions we commenced to decend very rapidly we continued going down all the afternoon in the evening we reached the Platt River which we found to be the last of our decending. The river here is thirty miles in a straight line from the outside of the mountains and about a mile higher it is a huge mountain torrent at this time roaring and tumbling tearing trees and rocks along in its headlong course yet we camped on its banks having the cheerlefs prospect of having to ford it early in the morning. I never camped yet during the whole trip with more complete lownefs of spirit we had left part of our company behind probably we would never see them again we met parties returning from the mountains who gave unfavorable accounts of the mines they also reported that the Indians were showing signs of hostility and gave it as their opinion that they would mafsacre all the white men on the mountains add to all these the knowledge that dangers and difficulties were increasing every day on the road we began to think that we would have to abandon our tea? wagons and pack our provisions through. On a cold mountain side cold and shivering no covering from the night air it was as cheerlefs a prospect as any one can imagine. At that time if I was at home with the same experience acquired I think nothing could induce me to leave the comforts of home for the dangers and difficulties of gold hunting.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64640,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64640","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:19+00:00","modified":"2020-04-16T21:16:37+00:00","filename":"b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg","authentication":"bfe6635ce7efa0758627dde0ed8d0b13","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00022_o2 copy.jpg","size":853269,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2829,"compression_ratio":0.055854640430462},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102630+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102630+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102630+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg","FileDateTime":1521817599,"FileSize":853269,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2829\"","Height":2829,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2829,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:23 09:59:45","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":312},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":966,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3541},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:10:04 10:26:30","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:10:04 10:26:30","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":65,"SubSecTimeDigitized":65,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2829,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":995,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/995","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"42\nIn the morning we got up very early to prepare for crofsing the river we had breakfast before daylight sometimes the sun would raise over the hills before ten O clock.

We got the first wagon acrofs in glorious style and the steep hill on the other side before the horses could be stopped we had to then go back again with the teams for the other three wagons they were all brought over in the same manner.

We crossed the same river no lefs than five times on that day and twice on the next day making nine times in all the sufferings and hardships we endured on each occasion of crossing cannot be

now commenced to decend for we stood on a mountain unclear about one thousand feet higher than the plane the decent was very abrupt and we had to tie three of our wheels to keep the wagon from pitching over upon the horses in about two hours we reached the park and found that it was even lovlier looking than we had imagined while looking upon it from the mountain top. The grafs was soft and green as a meadow in our own prairie state nice little brooks clear as crystal filled with brook trout sporting gayly before our eyes crofsed and recrofsed each other all over the surface of the plain everything looking so invitingly comfortable we made up our minds to camp there for the night We picketed out our horses and for the first time in four weeks they had good grafs we made a spear and caught some fine brook trout for supper that evening we had such a supper as might make an epicure envious of our enjoyment fish flesh and fowl the kinds being the trout venison and buffalo meat with some bacon to supply the grease for cooking and then we had some ducks for the dessert we made some warm biscuit and tea and it was really the most comfortable meal we had on the journey. This night we did not suffer any from cold we were sheltered from the winds by the mountains in the morning we started once more on a smooth level road in continued very good until noon when we came to a swamp or morafs similar to those in Illinois it was about a fourth of a mile acrofs and dreadful hard pulling sometimes I thought we must sink and go under the mud we held on bravely and at last got acrofs safe we then journeyed on and arrived at Tarryall an hour before sunset this is one hundred miles from Denver and eighty miles from the place we entered them it took us just ten days to come that distance. We were now at the mining ground the goal of all our hopes and expectations and when we came to look at the prospects it seemed as if we were as far as ever from realizing the acquiring of gold which had brought us so long a journey.

Tarryall had some prentensions to be called a town they had the plot all staked out into lots there was about forty houses erected and ten more in course of construction the ranches seemed to have a full stock of groceries and provisions and doing a pretty smart businefs. It was a pretty lively town there was a large tent big enough for to contain Dan Roe? \"Big Show\" with all kinds of gambling apparatus there and a large crowd always present pursuing the delusive phantom Another place you could see a Mexican leading fifteen or twenty jacks and bawling out at the top of his voice for some freight to carry over to the different gulches. Miners were to be met here in crowds rough looking as if they had lived in those mountains for twenty years some were coming to town to spend their pile of dust and others were you could tell it from their looks disapointed and were going in search of new diggings the latter were by far the greater number and their personal appearance was in most cases wretched in the extreme. I think gold seeking is the most uncertain and precarious businefs in the world a man is tempted and risks so much that he would not do in following other pursuits. If he has a claim in a remote place far away from any place where he could purchase provisions he will be tempted to stay working on that claim from day to day until his last mouthfull of provisions is exhausted then without anything to eat he will undertake a journey of twenty or thirty miles over mountains covered with snow and sometimes by paths unknown to him depending on luck only to keep him from starvation. Your real gold hunter is the most carelefs fellow in existance he thinks of gold sleeping and waking and new reported discoveries will excite his imagination and carry him off even at midnight to

was now growing dark so I had to leave farther observation for tomorrow and go back to camp, our camp was on the banks of the Tarryall river the waters of which was very yellow caused by the miners washing their dirt in the stream about two miles above. This night pafsed away pleasantly like the one before it not cold in the least, in the morning I took an early start up Tarryall Gulch to see the mining operations we pafsed through the town climbed some very rugged hills and then found ourselves at the mines the first time any of our party had ever seen gold washed. The procefs is very simple all that is necefsary is to turn the bed of the river which is done by making a tail ditch and running the water in a new channel then you remove the boulder stones from the bed of the stream sometimes a work of great labor some of them being so large that you must break them with a sledge hammer and remove them in pieces after getting them clean you then have to strip the earth off down to the bed rock sometimes it is only two feet and sometimes it may be twelve or fourteen . The dirt laying close to the rock is what is called the pay dirt  you will have to shovel that into your sluice a long box about from fifty to five hundred feet long with a small stream of water running through it and riffles placed near the end charged with quicksilver to catch the gold. The earth is shoveled in from the gulch runs down the whole lenght of the sluice carried along by the force of the water when it gets to the rifles the lighter particles will roll over the riffles but the gold being the heaviest will drop down and amalgamate with the quicksilver which is placed at the bottom of the riffles to receive it. You may keep shoveling all day then you take out your riffles squezze your quicksilver in a rag and the gold will seperate from it you then take your quicksilver and put it into a bottle it only loses twenty per cent by using what remains then is gold having only a small alloy of black sand.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64646,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64646","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:25+00:00","modified":"2020-01-28T22:45:58+00:00","filename":"0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg","authentication":"34ae770a123d47ba18bf1392218e567b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00026_o2

If northern man cannot go there and take a farm because they are averse to holding slaves and if he works his farm himself he is looked upon with scorn by his neighbor who works his farm by slaves he is constantly taunted with being from white trash and it annoys him so that he leaves in disgust and moves to some country where honest labor is not looked upon as a disgrace by the nabobs of the South. This is the only reason why this beautiful and fertile state is only settled along the river shores slavery is not a paying institution there consequently there is no danger of its spreading north as many of our northern people are afraid of, nature has erected barriers against slavery more potent than any that could be enacted by Congress, as soon as slavery is abolished in Missouri then will she take her stand along with her sister states the richest and proudest of all.

We went down to the Missouri river, and took passage on board of a ferry boat for Belmont, a village on the Kansas side about five miles from St Joe. The Missouri river here is about four hundred yards wide, the water is very yellow being a mixture of about one half part of sand and water, it has a very rapid current running at the rate of about ten miles an hour. In some places it is very deep but the sand bars are all movable which makes it very dangerous to navigation.

This night we enjoyed ourselves hugely, had a good meal of stewed rabbits and prairie chickens which we killed during the day, and as the evening was cold we built a rousing fire got out our buffalo skins spread them on the grass all round the fire, and stretched ourselves at full length to rest our weary limbs.

occurrance the inflicting of immediate punishment which is the invariable rule of our society on the plains the offender being caught is instantly tried by a jury picked up on the road the witnesses both for and against are heard and if not proved he is discharged forthwith, if guilty he will be punished according to the enormity of the offense, if for horse or mule stealing or murder, he is hung to the nearest tree, if a less grevious crime he is tied to a tree or wagon wheel and receives from ten to one hundred lashes on the bare back the amount to be fixed by the jury.

This afternoon we also met the Pony Express returning from San Francisco he passed us like the wind and we could not get a single word of news we camped tonight on the Blue River again. The following day at noon we parted from this beautiful little stream having traveled fifty miles along its banks we now struck out on the broad open prairie on  the old military road to California this road has been well worn by travel it is about one hundred feet broad and cut down from the constant rise about one foot its whole width. The whole immigration to and from California in 1848 and 1850 was over this highway it is now a splendid road the peculiar nature of the soil rendering it when exposed to the sun as hard as brick without any assistance from man. It is far ahead of the smoothest Mac Adanized roads in the States a wagon loaded with six to making no impression whatever on its flinty surface tonight we had to camp on the open prairie without wood or water the prospect was not all all encouraging and we could not help contrasting it with our abundance of the night previous of the Little Blue. We pitched our tent and camped on the side of the road picketed our horses and downharted and unhappy we threw ourselves on our blankets to find some rest. This was the first time I began to think of home with many regrets for leaving it all the hardships and difficulties of our undertaking then rose before my mind vividly and I could not help thinking

curious is it that no sooner did we realize a small share of hard life than we commence to complain of what we brought [unclear] ourselves knowingly and expecting even worse than what we then experienced. The next morning we commenced our journey again about noon we came to a pool of dirty water we camped here for dinner refreshed ourselves and started again on our journey that night we camped within ten miles of the Platt River but had to spend another night without wood or water we however felt more cheereful tonight at the near prospect of relief. In the morning we rose very early and were again on the road in about three hours we struck the great Plat River at grand island ten miles below Fort Karney we were so starved out for want of cooked victals that we determined to spend the remainder of the day and night here.

We feasted gloriously today on baked bread stewed rabbit and plenty of tea and coffee we made up for the privations of the three previous days.

The Fort consists of about twenty houses occupied as barracks officers quarters and a Post Office enclosing a square about one acre with twelve six pounder guns mounted three on each side of the square what they were placed there for I could not imagine as they could not fire them off without knocking down the buildings. It is very curious why they selected such a position for a fort it has no natural advantages whatever there isnot any shlter from an enemy no elevation to the ground and it is a mile away from the river and they have not even got a mud enclosure around it and I should think in case of assault the insiders would have no advantage over the besiegers. We were not allowed to stop in the immediate neighborhood of the \"Fort\" the rules being strict that no one should camp within two miles. I staid behind to get letters I found some from home tho first I received since leaving we were as eager to get news from home as if we had been away years instead of only two weeks. I read my letters found all well at home and then went out to the square to see the drill there was two companys United States Regulars find appearing men but sadly deficient of clothing almost every man was out at the knees or elbows even the offices looked shabby I saw them trying to get gloves on which required a great deal of skill they were full of holes and the fingers would not go out in the right place.

After our supper we looked up good quarters for our poor starved horses we found a place where the grass was splendid and tied them there for the night leaving a watch to look out for their safety we then lay down and had a comfortable nights sleep.

It might with justness be called an orchard in the centre was an open space of about ten acres all around it were rows of wild apple tree commonly called \"Crab\" growing as regularly and even distances apart as if planted by the hand of man indeed I never saw straighter rows of trees in the best kept gardens of our city it was a most singular freak of nature.

directions it seemed as if the very hills sprang suddenly to life, on the came rushing at a gallop up to our very wagons we then presented our rifles and they suddenly wheeled and turned away out of

We felt that something must be done and done soon or we should be hemmed in without hope of escape it would be the hight of madness to remain in our present position so we resolved to leave it or provoke the Indians to immediate attack, so ten of our members brought in our horses harnessed them up to the wagons and made all ready for a start the other forty still kept the rifles on the cock and presented at the foe.

Indians appeared to be very friendly and well disposed towards us eager to trade skins and moccasins for anything we might offer them.  We camped this night on a prairie dog city about ten miles square they are a queer looking little animal about the size of a cat fat and plump looking, they are very numerous, all that great extent of ground is full of holes about one yard apart, it is very hard to kill one of those little creatures they are very shy and at first appearance of an enemy in their vicinity their heels twinkle in the air, and they disappear in their holes in an instant, then commences a defeaning chorous of voices all barking furiously.  It is very hard to get a shot at one of them and if you succeed in killing it the others will pull it into the hole before you can lay hold of it we used to count it a great feat to capture one of them it was only for the sport as the flesh is unfit to eat.  The most remarkable thing about these little things is the mixture of races in their family, the dog, the owl and the rattlesnake all living peacefully in the same hole I have seen them all go down together many hundred times I think it is a very strange freak of nature.  In this part of the country were a great many rabbits called here Jackass Rabbits but I am told by people that are well informed on the matter that they are the regular old country hare they are very large we succeeded in killing some and the flesh was excellent, there is a knack in hunting them which if you do not know you could not kill one in a month when one starts up before you you must stand still and then he will stand still also ang sit on his hind legs and face right towards you if he is too far off for a shot advance slowly towards him in a straight line if you go zigzag he will know it at once and start off in this way you can come close enough to shoot him if he does take the alarm and start stop still

Mr. Collyer formed one of the court he was prosecuting Attorney elected by the people.  I must say that the court there with the exception of having the sanction of the government is legitemate the officers being regularly elected by the people they are sworn to do justice to all men.  We strolled some further round the city went down and called upon the editor of the Rocky Mountain News one of the daily papers published here and had him register our names under the head of late arrivals from the States.  We purchased six copies of his paper at ten cents a copy to send home to our friend we chatted pleasantly with him for an hour or so giving him all the latest news from the States.  We then strolled round and visited some of their hotels they looked very fine for such a remote place some of them were well furnished and spread good tables at the Pacific Hotel we had supper, after that we went out again on the street to pass the time till the trial was to come off.

their pockets till it was all gone and then they cheerfully go to work for more. The next day our friend William Clancy? arrived in town he was just from the gold regions of Gregory and gave us a very gloomy picture indeed of gold mining and our prospects he advised us to sell our goods (we could then get an eneromous price for them) realize all the money we could, and start back to the States. We would not consider such a proposition for a moment he then said if we were bound to go to the mountains that the best place for us was to go the Arkansas Diggings, about one hundred and eighty miles from Denver. He said it was a new discovery reported very rich and the immigration towards that place was not very numerous as yet so that day we made up our minds to start on the next morning for the Arkansas. We made all necessary preparations and started at daylight for the mountains about fifteen miles distant. the gigantic mass of earth seemed to be raising out of the earth every step we took towards it by noon we had made only eight miles and when we camped it seemed as far off as it was in the morning its tremendous peaks covered with eternal snow hung threathiningly over our heads and were in sight hundreds of miles north and south. We stopped only a short time for dinner and took another start the country here was slighting undulating but not enough to be called hilly and preserved the same aspect to the very base of the mountains. I think that this is very remarkable for in the neighborhood of most mountains the country for fifty miles from their base is very rough and hilly but here it was nice meadow land to the very mountain

laughing by us. It was a most magnificent sight, the setting sun tinged those gloomy hights with his golden yellow the white snow seemingly about to fall upon our heads, the slopes of the mountains rising ther above thir covered with the green pine and fir tree and on the other hand lay stretched the boundless prairie that we had just traversed. Denver City was plainly in sight although fifteen miles distant, the Plat river could be seen like a silver thread winding its course along the boosom? of the prairie. We pitched our camp staked out our horses got ready some supper, and then had leisure to view the stupendous wonders, around us. It was a glorious moonlight night the air soft and warm as summer, and the mountains looked grand and wierd? looking, the scene would almost inspire one with superstition and dread. We built a large fire sat around it we did not need it as the air was warm enough but we always considered it more sociable? the prairie traveler considers it lonly not to have a fire even the hottest days in summer. We sat and talked till late the night each one related all that he had heard or read unclear that huge frowning pile before us. some told of dangers hardships and privations, of parties starting to cross them and they were never heard of afterwards. stores of wild animals and hostile Indians, till we got our imagination worked up to that pitch that we could almost imagine that those gloomy piles were peopled by evil and malignant spirits. Still if it was so it would not deter people from going there in search of the shining ore which scarcely ever brings happiness to its possessor. At a late hour in the night we lay down by our camp fire to sleep but it did not visit my eyelids for some hours after I could not close my eyes on the beautiful appearance of those mountains.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64637,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64637","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:16+00:00","modified":"2020-04-11T18:57:40+00:00","filename":"334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg","authentication":"aa86594de0feef8c39d6d615c702fc91","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00020_o2.jpg","size":849460,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2832,"compression_ratio":0.055546400920695},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102538+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102538+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102538+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"334a68ad1a0589bf6f3e3f4bc2b9a6ae.jpg","FileDateTime":1521817599,"FileSize":849460,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2832\"","Height":2832,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2832,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:23 09:59:44","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":312},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":966,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3634},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:10:04 10:25:38","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:10:04 10:25:38","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":22,"SubSecTimeDigitized":22,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2832,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":995,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/995","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"39 I had a refreshing nights sleep and awoke in the morning about daybreak the rest of the boys were already up and busy preparing to make a start in to the mountains, but we remarked?

By this time we had all things prepared and commenced to climb the old Rockys?. we entered through a defile or mountain gulley the dried up bed of a stream there was still a small rivulet running in its lowest parts on either hand rose towering precipices that would make the eyes ache to look to their summits. The ascent was very gradual for the first two miles but a steady incline upward, at this point the mountains presented a most sublime view huge rocked piled ther above their? thousands of feet above our heads threathening at the slightest jar or puff of wind to rush resistlessly down to our destruction. Along by our feet rushed a small mountain torrent its water cold and clear as crystal refreshed our lips many times during that weary ascent, we continued on till about noon and made probably six miles on our journey. As soon as we entered the mountains we lost altogether our view of the plains our compass was the only means of knowing in what direction we were going our main course so far was southwest. At the spot where we camped for dinner there was scarcely room for our wagons unclear stand the mountains rose on both sides of us almost perpindicular the road made in the bottom was only just wide enough for one wagon. After a rest of a couple of hours we commenced to climb again the road commenced to get very rough and stony and some places very steep hills to climb so very steep that we would have to get four teams of horses to pull us up.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64638,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64638","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7283590fba7362371ba1ae152f52ecdc.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7283590fba7362371ba1ae152f52ecdc.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7283590fba7362371ba1ae152f52ecdc.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7283590fba7362371ba1ae152f52ecdc.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:17+00:00","modified":"2020-04-11T19:09:19+00:00","filename":"7283590fba7362371ba1ae152f52ecdc.jpg","authentication":"6026a020448cbc57778848aa7ce53c4c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00021_o2

It was very slow going now and shortly before sunset finding a level spot of ground we camped for the night we made only three miles this afternoon making seven crossed out nine in all and the hardest days journey we had yet performed. I was so fitugued? and wearied out that I threw myself full length upon the grass and fell asleep before supper. If this was to be a sample of a mountain road we were led to believe it was a good mountain road if so Lord help us when we got where there was no road, it was enough to make a man despair to think of having to travel one hundred and eighty miles of road worse than that, for we were informed that the first part of the road was the best. We got our supplies and then gathered some dry pine logs which were here in abundance to keep up a good fire for the night although only an hour after dark and nine miles into the mountains the indications were that we would have some frost before morning. So we started a huge fire brought out our buffalo skins and blankets and fixed our sleeping places for the night, we were obliged to sleep in the open air for we could not find level space enough to spread our tent. we pickitted our horses set the watch and things being all right lay down and took our first snooze on the Rocky Mountain. No one who has no experienced it can imagine the delicious feeling that comes over the weary traveller who has unclear up steep mountainsides all day when he throws himself down to repose at night on his harce? bed with nothing but the sky for a covering. I have lain on my back for hours watching those numberless stars ever changing their positions, the moon sailing brightly through milk white clouds, the beautiful \"milky way\" showing like a belt of silver across the sky, in this place it shows clearer and brighter than in any other part of the world, tall spires and peaks raising their snow capped peaks heavenward in all directions and on every side it is here in such a place as this that the heart turns to admiration at the skill of the wonderful creator of all these wonders.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64639,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64639","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/037ee6e7a62b215d542ea783a1be2c1a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/037ee6e7a62b215d542ea783a1be2c1a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/037ee6e7a62b215d542ea783a1be2c1a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/037ee6e7a62b215d542ea783a1be2c1a.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:18+00:00","modified":"2020-04-14T19:43:46+00:00","filename":"037ee6e7a62b215d542ea783a1be2c1a.jpg","authentication":"d9446ba275057404cbd4e16b2a91243f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00021_o2.jpg","size":869607,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

journeying about four days more the country became so mountanious that we were forced to make two parts of our loads, we built a small hut in the woods by the roadside put in about half our provisions and leaving two of our party in charge we started once more on our journey. We were now on the most elevated range of the mountains all around us was clouds and snow the air was very opprefsive after climbing a small hill you would pant like a sheep on a hot day the hight of this dividing range is about eighteen thousand feet. In the afternoon after leaving our companions we commenced to decend very rapidly we continued going down all the afternoon in the evening we reached the Platt River which we found to be the last of our decending. The river here is thirty miles in a straight line from the outside of the mountains and about a mile higher it is a huge mountain torrent at this time roaring and tumbling tearing trees and rocks along in its headlong course yet we camped on its banks having the cheerlefs prospect of having to ford it early in the morning. I never camped yet during the whole trip with more complete lownefs of spirit we had left part of our company behind probably we would never see them again we met parties returning from the mountains who gave unfavorable accounts of the mines they also reported that the Indians were showing signs of hostility and gave it as their opinion that they would mafsacre all the white men on the mountains add to all these the knowledge that dangers and difficulties were increasing every day on the road we began to think that we would have to abandon our tea? wagons and pack our provisions through. On a cold mountain side cold and shivering no covering from the night air it was as cheerlefs a prospect as any one can imagine. At that time if I was at home with the same experience acquired I think nothing could induce me to leave the comforts of home for the dangers and difficulties of gold hunting.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64640,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64640","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:19+00:00","modified":"2020-04-16T21:16:37+00:00","filename":"b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg","authentication":"bfe6635ce7efa0758627dde0ed8d0b13","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00022_o2 copy.jpg","size":853269,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2829,"compression_ratio":0.055854640430462},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102630+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102630+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["102630+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b31b0f5ba5ea023a82bf82039907a3b9.jpg","FileDateTime":1521817599,"FileSize":853269,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2829\"","Height":2829,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2829,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:23 09:59:45","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":312},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":966,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3541},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:10:04 10:26:30","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:10:04 10:26:30","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":65,"SubSecTimeDigitized":65,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2829,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":995,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/995","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"42\nIn the morning we got up very early to prepare for crofsing the river we had breakfast before daylight sometimes the sun would raise over the hills before ten O clock.

We got the first wagon acrofs in glorious style and the steep hill on the other side before the horses could be stopped we had to then go back again with the teams for the other three wagons they were all brought over in the same manner.

We crossed the same river no lefs than five times on that day and twice on the next day making nine times in all the sufferings and hardships we endured on each occasion of crossing cannot be

now commenced to decend for we stood on a mountain unclear about one thousand feet higher than the plane the decent was very abrupt and we had to tie three of our wheels to keep the wagon from pitching over upon the horses in about two hours we reached the park and found that it was even lovlier looking than we had imagined while looking upon it from the mountain top. The grafs was soft and green as a meadow in our own prairie state nice little brooks clear as crystal filled with brook trout sporting gayly before our eyes crofsed and recrofsed each other all over the surface of the plain everything looking so invitingly comfortable we made up our minds to camp there for the night We picketed out our horses and for the first time in four weeks they had good grafs we made a spear and caught some fine brook trout for supper that evening we had such a supper as might make an epicure envious of our enjoyment fish flesh and fowl the kinds being the trout venison and buffalo meat with some bacon to supply the grease for cooking and then we had some ducks for the dessert we made some warm biscuit and tea and it was really the most comfortable meal we had on the journey. This night we did not suffer any from cold we were sheltered from the winds by the mountains in the morning we started once more on a smooth level road in continued very good until noon when we came to a swamp or morafs similar to those in Illinois it was about a fourth of a mile acrofs and dreadful hard pulling sometimes I thought we must sink and go under the mud we held on bravely and at last got acrofs safe we then journeyed on and arrived at Tarryall an hour before sunset this is one hundred miles from Denver and eighty miles from the place we entered them it took us just ten days to come that distance. We were now at the mining ground the goal of all our hopes and expectations and when we came to look at the prospects it seemed as if we were as far as ever from realizing the acquiring of gold which had brought us so long a journey.

Tarryall had some prentensions to be called a town they had the plot all staked out into lots there was about forty houses erected and ten more in course of construction the ranches seemed to have a full stock of groceries and provisions and doing a pretty smart businefs. It was a pretty lively town there was a large tent big enough for to contain Dan Roe? \"Big Show\" with all kinds of gambling apparatus there and a large crowd always present pursuing the delusive phantom Another place you could see a Mexican leading fifteen or twenty jacks and bawling out at the top of his voice for some freight to carry over to the different gulches. Miners were to be met here in crowds rough looking as if they had lived in those mountains for twenty years some were coming to town to spend their pile of dust and others were you could tell it from their looks disapointed and were going in search of new diggings the latter were by far the greater number and their personal appearance was in most cases wretched in the extreme. I think gold seeking is the most uncertain and precarious businefs in the world a man is tempted and risks so much that he would not do in following other pursuits. If he has a claim in a remote place far away from any place where he could purchase provisions he will be tempted to stay working on that claim from day to day until his last mouthfull of provisions is exhausted then without anything to eat he will undertake a journey of twenty or thirty miles over mountains covered with snow and sometimes by paths unknown to him depending on luck only to keep him from starvation. Your real gold hunter is the most carelefs fellow in existance he thinks of gold sleeping and waking and new reported discoveries will excite his imagination and carry him off even at midnight to

was now growing dark so I had to leave farther observation for tomorrow and go back to camp, our camp was on the banks of the Tarryall river the waters of which was very yellow caused by the miners washing their dirt in the stream about two miles above. This night pafsed away pleasantly like the one before it not cold in the least, in the morning I took an early start up Tarryall Gulch to see the mining operations we pafsed through the town climbed some very rugged hills and then found ourselves at the mines the first time any of our party had ever seen gold washed. The procefs is very simple all that is necefsary is to turn the bed of the river which is done by making a tail ditch and running the water in a new channel then you remove the boulder stones from the bed of the stream sometimes a work of great labor some of them being so large that you must break them with a sledge hammer and remove them in pieces after getting them clean you then have to strip the earth off down to the bed rock sometimes it is only two feet and sometimes it may be twelve or fourteen . The dirt laying close to the rock is what is called the pay dirt  you will have to shovel that into your sluice a long box about from fifty to five hundred feet long with a small stream of water running through it and riffles placed near the end charged with quicksilver to catch the gold. The earth is shoveled in from the gulch runs down the whole lenght of the sluice carried along by the force of the water when it gets to the rifles the lighter particles will roll over the riffles but the gold being the heaviest will drop down and amalgamate with the quicksilver which is placed at the bottom of the riffles to receive it. You may keep shoveling all day then you take out your riffles squezze your quicksilver in a rag and the gold will seperate from it you then take your quicksilver and put it into a bottle it only loses twenty per cent by using what remains then is gold having only a small alloy of black sand.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64646,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64646","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:07:25+00:00","modified":"2020-01-28T22:45:58+00:00","filename":"0753c2720921e011f17f0e1aec7b1adb.jpg","authentication":"34ae770a123d47ba18bf1392218e567b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00026_o2

day we met crowds of immigrants bound for the gold regions. they did not feel the least disheartened by the discouraging accounts they received from those returning, there is such a charm about the very name of digging gold. every one thinks he will be the lucky person and where so many failed that he may perhaps make his fortune. Fill them full of stories about wonderful discoveries and they will believe it all because it agrees with their inclinations but tell them about the dangers and difficulties all the privations hunger cold and fatigue they will have to undergo, of working up to their knees in cold ice water, they will only laugh at you and will not give credit to it. After crossing the Platt the last time we struck in to the new road called the Bradford road. it was an improvement on any road that I had yet traveled on in the mountains they had a large gang of men to work grading it. they charged us two dollars toll for travelling it. About noon on the tenth day from leaving Carryall we came to the outside of the mountains and it was a most grand looking sight that was then presented to our eyes. We stood on a level plateau about a mile high the road winding down it steep side looked from one position to be  impossible for a four footed beast to descend. Far below us white clouds were sailing along and mingling with the mountains we could see the plains stretching hundreds of miles below us the great Platt River dotted with dark looking timber on either banks could be traced a great distance. Denver City fifteen miles distance  still?  seemed to be almost directly under us every building stood plain and distinct. in the neighborhood of the mountains the air is so pure that objects

We chained three wheels on the wagon before starting down hill and then the wagon kept pushing hard on the horses the road was made on the top of a sharp hill by taking off a few shovelfulls of of the top and so making it flat for about six feet. If you got over the sides you would fall down a steep precipice hundreds of feet and of course dashed to pieces it was a dangerous business to sit in the wagon and guide the horses we all tried it in turns but grew frightened and gave it up at last we had to take hold and lead the horses by the heads. We could see far down below us a  crowd of teams waiting get past about half way down there was a place for turning out and we having the road first they had to wait till we got past. It was hard work enough to get down but I pity the poor animals that had to drag up there, the hill was about five miles long and a steady raise all the time without any breathing places. I would not take ten dollars and walk up the hill without carrying anything. We passed the teams that were waiting and before sundown arrived at the bottom and camped in a green fertile valley.

It appeared as if the slightest push would send it rolling from its rocky foundation, yet they have stood there and defied the storms for hundreds of years. The chief curiosity about them is I think in their being exactly similar you could not find the slightest difference. they stand about one hundred yards asunder they look like two mighty sentinals guarding the entrance to those gloomy regions. It is said that the Indians regarded them with fear and that before the coming of white men that they never entered the Rocky Mountains by this pass. viewed at the distance of a few miles they very much resemble the forms of men and I think it a matter of course that the poor ignorant Indian should view them with superstition and awe.

the dark course of the Platt River and the city of Denver on its banks The murmer of falling cascades on the ear ad the delight of all that was grand and terrible in nature would powerfully effect any imagination and set you to dreaming. On the following day we arrived at Denver city it had improved wonderfully during the two months since I had last seen it. Many buildings had been put up and others were building which would be called first clap buildings in many of our eastern cities. On Larimer St near the bridge was built a government Post Office and adjoining it they were constructing a U.S. Mint. it had already the appearance of a substantial and permanent city. I noticed that the streets were  tronged?  by Sioux Indians and upon inquiry I ascertained that there was about five thousand within a half mile of the city on the river bank. It caused great uneasiness in the city the inhabitants of which felt the utmost apprehension of an attack but the savage horde. They had already organised a company of militia for its protection on the day after our a arrival they had invited the chiefs to a consultation in the town hall. six chiefs attended and the result of the conference was that the Indians agreed to go five miles down the river and encamp. the citizens agreed that if the Sioux were attacked by the Utes with whom they were then at war to send a company of militia to their assistance.

I have seen more human misery and suffering on that road in one day than I would hear of in a year in the city of Chicago. I have seen poor fellows left a happy and comfortable home, started with some friends and a fair outfit. now their subsistance had vanished sickness had laid its heavy hand upon them and the friends of their prosperous days deserted them in their misfortune. That is the place to try a true friend he that would stick to me crossing those plains through toil hardship and sickness I would call a true friend and I should depend on him ever afterward.

place I saw a legal notice posted on a corner it was to the following effect, that the undersigned had built a bridge some two months since on Lariner st over Cherry Creek connecting the town of Auraria and Denver, that certain parties having failed to make the payments on said bridge as agreed upon, that after three days they forbid any one to cross said bridge at their peril that they should have a sufficient force there and shoot down any who would attempt to disobey this order of the court. Before we left the city I heard that they raised the money and paid for the bridge. This summary way of doing business works to a charm there is no resisting the court no such thing heard of as fining any one for contempt because no one would dare to show it he would be punished on the spot and in a most unpleasant manner. Since we arrived in the city there had been two executions and by making inquiries I found out that there is somebody hung every week. You must not think from this that was a hard place to live in I never saw a more quiet and law observing city I believe the severe and instantanous punishment of crime  ?  preventive, all the murders committed here spring from the gambling table the termination of a dispute was always left to the pistol or Bowie knife if one of the gamblers was killed the surviver was sure to have his neck stretched before two days and thus the community would be well rid of two ruffians. What was considered a crime deserving of death when committed by gamblers was passed off quietly as justifiable when done by other parties, if two men got into a dispute on the street they could settle it in any manner they thought proper and if one killed the other it was all done in fair fight and there was no hint of punishment but if it was a gambler he deserved no mercy and was hung up without any mercy.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64696,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64696","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/ec8dc2c77a7141988f93fb1b35687b58.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/ec8dc2c77a7141988f93fb1b35687b58.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/ec8dc2c77a7141988f93fb1b35687b58.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/ec8dc2c77a7141988f93fb1b35687b58.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:08:11+00:00","modified":"2020-05-15T16:57:40+00:00","filename":"ec8dc2c77a7141988f93fb1b35687b58.jpg","authentication":"73f5d3acc7c4e9e2cfdc176d503f3c90","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00052_o2

our preparations being now completed on Friday the first day of July we determined to make a start for home. About noon we went to the \"Ranche\" to take out our animals our horses were easily found they were very poor and there was no danger of any one stealing them. A friend of ours who came with us did not have such good fortune he put a valuable team of mules into the Ranche now they could not be found the poor fellow grew frantic when he discovered his loss. The Ranche keeper could give no account of them but he supposed they were stolen during the night by the laws of the place he was responsible and could be made liable for the worth of any property left in his possession. But the owner of the mules would rather have them at that time than twice their nominal value at Denver. So he hired horses and scoured the country in all directions but it was a vain pursuit he never seen or heard aught of them. I am firmly convinced that the rascally \"Rancher\" connived at stealing them it was said that many valuable teams were taken from his place. Any how he got a judgement against the Ranche keeper for two hundred and fifty dollars. The Ranche was levied on and was to be sold in thirty days but the poor fellow could not remain there that long under expenses so he intrusted its collection to a lawyer of good standing in the city, and getting some friends to aid him he purchased another team and started for home. His lawyer was to send the price of his mules in a month but he never got a cent of it nor never received a bit of information from his lawyer there is no doubt but what the latter got the money and appropriated it to his own use. An honest man is a a rare thing to be found in any place but I think it is impossible to find one at all in a gold producing country, the very fact of  being where got easy brings around a lot of

We took the old road by the Platt River. we heard of some Indian massacres on the cut off and knew it was very dangerous to travel it. Our party consisted of three wagons and only five persons rather a small party for crossing those dreary plains. We felt dreadful lonesome. I could not help contrasting our present position coming back disapointed from the land of gold our teams almost starved and ourselves worn out by hardships and anxieties of mind. On our journey hither we were full of high hope. we considered our fortunes was ready for us as soon as we should reach the mountains we had plenty of merry company all as sanguine as ourselves and with high health and rugged strength we enjoyed ourselves hugely and had nothing to ask for we traveled about five miles that afternoon and camped at night with the tribe of Sioux Indians that left Denver a few days before.

Before it grew quite dark we saw a great cloud of dust coming from the east soon we could see that it was a long string of wagons it was a train of about twenty wagons loaded with a crusher and machinery steam engine boiler & c, There was about twenty five men with the train and we were very glad to have company for the night we found among them some acquantances from Chicago and got all the news from home in a short time. They were just as anxious to hear accounts of gold mining so we told them our experiences and what we considered their prospects in the country. I think the crusher is the only way that gold can ever be got in paying quantities from the rocky mountains. the quartz is rich in every part and if they can only get machinery that can pulverize it there is no doubt but that they can make money in that way. We chatted with them till very late of home and friends they left Chicago just seven weeks before that time and considering their heavy load they made first rate time. We all camped together that night father than some howling and yelling had no annoyance from the Indians just as soon as it gets dark they will not come near a white mans camp they know that we keep a watch and they are afraid of getting shot. At sunrise the next morning we parted from the train each one going in opposite direction. our road to day was through the finest land I had yet seen in this country the grass was nice and green and about four feet high I think it would be first rate lands to cultivate.

day we passed a beautiful island on the Platt River it was intirely different from any islands that I had yet seen the banks were bold and high and covered to the edge of the water with willow trees. There is a  bridge across the river here many of the immigrants cross it as it is the shortest route to Gregory there is a very fine house on the island but so covered in by thick foliage that you can not get a glimpse of it untill you are standing bedside it. It was built about fifteen years ago by a fur company for the purpose of a trading post with the Indians of the Rocky Mountains. We were now passing through a most delightful country the land rich, the grass luxurious, the blue river running clear and ripling by. it is the most charming place between the Missouri river and the Rocky Mountains. This day we met five crusher trains and great crowds of emmigrants pushing their way westward we would scan the faces eagerly while passing them to see if we could discover among them any one with whom we were acquanted. The Indians were very numerous in this vecinity we had left the Sioux country behind and were now among the Arrapahoes. they are a little superior to the Sioux in habits and appearance. it seems that wherever the white and the Indian live close together that the Indian will become filthy and depraved. It is accounted for by the white man selling him whisky. the Indian is passionately fond of it and would sell himself body and soul family and friends and children for to gratify his fiery appetite. The Indians used us very friendly seemed to be very eager to trade with us they brought out heaps of buck skins moccasins and buffalo roves we got some of the latter from them for about one pound of sugar for each hide. Money they would not take at all but sugar coffee and meat hams or bacon they could not resist exchanging for the most valuable commodity in their possession.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64700,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64700","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/5bf4d5ffcdb79131546339c1b56b4b52.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/5bf4d5ffcdb79131546339c1b56b4b52.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/5bf4d5ffcdb79131546339c1b56b4b52.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5bf4d5ffcdb79131546339c1b56b4b52.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:08:15+00:00","modified":"2020-05-04T16:17:14+00:00","filename":"5bf4d5ffcdb79131546339c1b56b4b52.jpg","authentication":"35126ac5d3ec23790239119ca22e7197","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00054_o2

It took us a week to get through their country and I really thought more of them than any I had yet seen on the plains.

We were very much afraid that the Indians would come and make an attack on us to get the whiskey we kept a strict guard all the night and I think they were hovering around us all the night but were afraid to make an attack as they knew we were prepared for them. However the night passed over without any trouble and we were mighty thankful for it. it is a very foolish thing under any circumstances to let Indians have the taste of whiskey. The moment you do it they lose all confidence in you become treacherous and extremly dangerous. you cannot trade or have any communication whatever with them afterward. In the morning we passed through the village the Indians eyed us savagely looking as if they would like to tare us in pieces. they did not come out as usual with their kind salute or their pile of skins and robes but kept a sullen silence while we were passing. All that enmity was caused by us having the whiskey they expected to find us unprepared and take it during the night but being mistaken in that and finding that we were on the elert they considered that we had done them some grevious injury I did not feel safe untill I got several miles between us and the unfriendly tribe That was the only time on our journey home that the Indians showed any hostile feelings and then it was provoked by ourselves and we were only five passing alone through this vast country of

Every thing was parched and withered from the fierce heat of the sun the grass looked as if fire passed over it large fissures opened in the earth and night and day we suffered dreadfully from the intense heat. To add to our torments just as the sun went down the misquitoes assailled us furiously. they came around in myriads almost driving us mad by their incessent singing and their tantalizing sting. Of all the torments that ever was inflicted on poor humanity I think this is the most dreadful. there is not a moments relief no matter how tired you may be it is impossible to sleep you may lay down cover yourself all over with your blanket but you will not be safe. Some prying adventurous fellow will find a corner unprotected and will quickly intrude his proboseis and almost before you can roll out of your blanket he will have a measure of your blood. There I used to lay for hours fighting desperately with my small enimies with blankets rolled all around me and the prespiration streaming from every pore at last towards morning when the air grew cool we might get relief from our tormenters and snatch a few hours sleep. Oftentimes I thought they would kill some of us the torture was most horrible and not to be compared to anything I ever experienced how I would long for some quiet cool spot where free from any annoyance I could have a few hours undisturbed slumber.

Journeying along slowly for we made only fifteen miles a day on an average it took us three weeks to accomplish the same distance that we had made in one week on our journey out. we arrived at the cotton wood springs and felt as though we had escaped a death from starvation by gaining the friendly shelter of the cotton woods.

Our mode of traveling left plenty of idle time on our hands at mid-day the sun poured down with intense heat so that it was as impossible for animals of any description to travel beneath its sweltering rays. We rose an hour before daybreak hitched up and immediately started. we traveled about four hours untill the sun grew pretty hot, when we looked for a shady place and camped then we had breakfast and then for six or seven long tedious hours we had to lay still in the shade I had Walter Scots works in pamphlet form and that was a first rate of opportunity for reading them I believe I should have died of the blues but for them. About three hours before sunset we started again on the road and traveled somtimes till an hour after dark or untill we found a desirable camping place. we made about fifteen miles a day just as much as our horses were able to accomplish. One night we camped after dark  in fixing the horses I stumbled several times over a little mound of earth. in the morning I was shocked to find out that we had been sleeping on a grave. we slept quiet and undisturbed during the night but if we knew of the lonly sleeper beneath us we would have left that place in a hurry.

As I saw those innumerable resting places of the California immigrants I shudderingly thought what if I should yet be laid down on this long dreary endless road to take my last long sleep to make one of those lowly mounds of earth of which we passed hundreds every day. I confess the thoughts were exceedingly unpleasant and I longed more than ever for to reach the borders of civilization. About seventy miles from Fort Karney we came to a new established trading post and purchased there some nescessaries we paid thirty cents a pound for flour forty cents for sugar and forty cents for bacon. The house was what is called a \"adobe\" house being made intirely of mud the roof having a few timbers on it and then sodded at a distance you would think it a small natural hill. The travelers we met told us that we would find plenty of buffalo in a few days the news raised us to the highest state of excitement we longed to encounter the huge unwieldy native of the prairies. The following night we were aroused by a bellowing noise we supposed it to be a herd of buffalos as the noise gradually died away. In the morning we eagerly scanned the prairie in every direction but could see no signs of buffalo we harnassed up our horses and traveled about eight miles. We heard a low rumbling noise like distant thunder then a great cloud of dust arose increasing every moment in extent and reaching up to the clouds we were in the highest state of excitement the cloud of dust suddenly cleared away and we saw an immense hered of buffalo only about a quarter of mile distant. It was a most grand and imposing sight from the slight elevation on which we were standing this great living mass could be seen stretching miles and miles away as far as the eye could reach was one compact solid body moving in one direction and making the earth shake beneath them.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64709,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64709","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/cfacd7f5e37e111f731218b37ffc0bb7.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/cfacd7f5e37e111f731218b37ffc0bb7.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/cfacd7f5e37e111f731218b37ffc0bb7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cfacd7f5e37e111f731218b37ffc0bb7.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:08:25+00:00","modified":"2020-05-08T20:21:23+00:00","filename":"cfacd7f5e37e111f731218b37ffc0bb7.jpg","authentication":"c9a42dc2e96882e701c14faef8ba325d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00061_o2.jpg","size":1372354,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2308,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.055056245587008},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["105718+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["105718+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["105718+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cfacd7f5e37e111f731218b37ffc0bb7.jpg","FileDateTime":1521817601,"FileSize":1372354,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2308\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2308,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Windows","DateTime":"2013:01:07 06:17:21","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":178},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:10:04 10:57:18","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:10:04 10:57:18","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":78,"SubSecTimeDigitized":78,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2441,"ExifImageLength":3807,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":995,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/995","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"They were traveling parallel with the road and soon we were within one hundred yards of the nearest we got out our rifles fired a volley and dropped two of them. one died instantly the other received five or six shots before he stretched himself out this was a glorious commencement of buffalo hunting and we felt highly elated at our success. We then proceeded to dress our game one was a young bull about four years old the other an old chap about sixteen the young one was about the size of a large ox five of us had all we could do to roll him over. we first cut off the hump considered by hunters as the choicest part then we skinned him the skin is valueless in this season and we trew it away then we cut him up into quarters in the same way they dress beeves at home. We kept some for cooking fresh and jerked the balance this is rather a curious process and worth describing we tear off the meat with the grain in thin slices then throw on some salt if you wish but it is not necessary for saving it then hang it in the sun or suspend it before a hot fire untill thoroughly dry it is then jerked meat and perfectly cured you may throw it in the bottom of your wagon or in any out of the way place and it will keep sweet and  good for a year or more Jerked buffalo meat salt I liked the flavor of very well but could not indure it in any other shape I tried it boiled and fried but could not bear the taste, even the hump what is called sweh a delicious morsel is as tough a sole leather and the liver as tough as ordinary  beef. The buffalo is only vulnerable in one small place under the fore shoulder if you drive a bullet in there he will drop on the instant but if you strike him in any other place it only irritates but cannot seriously hurt him.

They were seemingly intirely regardless of our presence all the afternoon they crossed the road going down to the river to drink sometimes they would crowd on us so that we had to stop the horses to avoid mixing up with them, After we had camped about ten double teams belonging to the Fort and loaded with timber passed us they broke through the buffalo at a gallop scattering them right and left the drivers yelling at them like tame cattle, We were afraid they might stampede over us in the night for they were unpleasantly close to us we built a great fire trusting that that would keep them off for we were so wearied out by suffering from misquitoes and starvation that we were unable to keep watch I was woke several times during the night by a loud bellowing seemingly right by the side of our camp. I always looked out to see that our horses were safe, they were in deadly fear and trembled all the night. Yet if they once got loose with the buffalo when on a stampede it would be impossible to ever get them again, the lowest spirited critter that ever crossed the plain will run off with them and it requires the greatest precaution on the part of the traveler to keep his cattle from getting away from  ?  with the wild herd.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64712,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64712","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/48da03ac5318dcd6f6c1c039e024ee9d.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/48da03ac5318dcd6f6c1c039e024ee9d.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/48da03ac5318dcd6f6c1c039e024ee9d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/48da03ac5318dcd6f6c1c039e024ee9d.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:08:28+00:00","modified":"2020-05-08T20:16:44+00:00","filename":"48da03ac5318dcd6f6c1c039e024ee9d.jpg","authentication":"9229455be846972b02296146006db890","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00064_o2.jpg","size":1613955,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2905,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.051442436412316},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["105752+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["105752+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20121004"],"TimeCreated":["105752+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20121004"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"48da03ac5318dcd6f6c1c039e024ee9d.jpg","FileDateTime":1521817601,"FileSize":1613955,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2905\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2905,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"19mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Windows","DateTime":"2013:01:07 06:16:22","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":178},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:10:04 10:57:52","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:10:04 10:57:52","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":83,"SubSecTimeDigitized":83,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3063,"ExifImageLength":3795,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":995,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/995","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The night passed away without any accident in the morning when the sun rose there was countless herds of buffalo all around us we were hemmed in on every side, the only vacent spot of earth for miles was the small space that surrounded ourselves and horses.

And to add to our troubles we were afraid that our remaining horse would give out, the poor creature was almost broken down from hard work and starvation, at this time we only made ten miles a day. Gladly we hailed our approach to Marysville we hoped at that place to find some sort of a hack to assist our unfortunate horse. We found the town greatly enlarged since we had passed through it. it had now quite the appearance of a business town in the States business had been quite lively there during the summer the store keepers looked stiff and important it looked like as if they were flush of money. We could not find any kind of crittre to buy or borrow so we had to commence our weary journey again on the old style, we passed through the town on Sunday morning and made ten miles that day in the evening a fierce hurricane arose quite a frequent thing in the plains and leveled Marysville with the ground the next day we saw crowds of the sufferers on their way to St Joe they had lost everything the only indications of a storm that we had was seeing some dark heavy clouds rising in the west about that time and a little rain but the wind was not unusually strong.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64716,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64716","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c8f99499caf2bb4909d24bfbf19dfffa.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/c8f99499caf2bb4909d24bfbf19dfffa.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/c8f99499caf2bb4909d24bfbf19dfffa.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c8f99499caf2bb4909d24bfbf19dfffa.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:08:32+00:00","modified":"2020-05-13T20:48:54+00:00","filename":"c8f99499caf2bb4909d24bfbf19dfffa.jpg","authentication":"b6f5f899c69b99875d11106b56f6c912","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00068_o2

coming to a camping ground this evening we met with a friend with whom we had traveled on the early part of our journey, one of his horses also died and he had purchased a yoke of oxen and was well pleased with the exchange he very generoulsly offered us the use of his remaining horse for the balance of the journey. We were now again on the borders of civilization there was a few farms on the banks of the streams, we eagerly purchased some vegatables butter eggs and bread we had none of these things for five months and you cannot imagine how good they tasted. We were a pretty hard looking set, sun burned as brown as Indians our hair and beard of five months growth and our cloths all torn into rags. our boots and shoes gave out more than a month since. Still we lived well we had an abundance of game, prairie chickens and quails they were so numerous that we could kill them with sticks, living so well we now took things quite leisuarly and was in no hurry together to the end of our journey. Plums and grapes grew in profusion in the forests the weather was beautiful and only for the great drouth we might have prolonged our journey a week more It was near seven weeks since we left Denver City and there had not been a drop of rain in that time farmers were greatly alarmed for their crops. their  ?  was dying in great numbers. We suffered great inconvenience from a scarcity of water we always had to carry a supply in a ten gallon keg and when that supply ran out we suffered very severely, only for that we would have probably have prolonged our journey another week. About fifty miles from St Joe we came into the bluffs of the Missouri River which was probably ten miles from us in a straight line, the whole country through which we now traveled was covered with enermos large cottonwood trees.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":64717,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/64717","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/aefa1fb0929c651610046c10d8aeb28a.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/aefa1fb0929c651610046c10d8aeb28a.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/aefa1fb0929c651610046c10d8aeb28a.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/aefa1fb0929c651610046c10d8aeb28a.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-23T15:08:33+00:00","modified":"2020-05-08T15:04:33+00:00","filename":"aefa1fb0929c651610046c10d8aeb28a.jpg","authentication":"f916b2dadb97abd881e5310c9a43d551","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3210_00068_o2.jpg","size":798945,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

arrived at the Missouri River without any other accident or adventure drove onboard the St Joe and Belmont ferry and soon landed on the levee of St Joseph.

Our returning journey from the mountains took just fifty two days including all delays from fatigue or other causes. Crowds of people gathered round us eagerly making inquiris about the land of gold we were some of the first returned pilgrims as they styled us we passed through the town to the lower end and then camped in the usual style some of our party felt big and wanted to go to a hotel they could not endure camp life another hour. There was still a few immegrants in St Joe about setting out for the west and there was ten crushers starting on the same day the whole number of crushers we met on the road was fifty three each one represented about ten thousand dollars. The first thing we done after hitching up was to go down town and into the a first class eating house we felt so very odd at first that we could hardly use a knife or fork it would be more natural to go with the victuals in the old style. We stopped in St Joe four days and then took the cors for Chicago arriving there two days after having made the whole trip to Pikes Peak and back in five months and two days.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}]

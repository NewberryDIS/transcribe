We are fighting for God, I take it, and it is right and proper that we should be Knightly in so high and gracious a cause X I am glad to learn from your Sister that the Sermons of Rev. F. W. Robertson of my land are so highly valued by you both. He was the noblest man whom I ever knew; and it was my good fortune to know him intimately, so far as a boy can enter into relationship with a mature man. And the teachings and showings of that man have had over my nature more influence for good that the teachings of all other men combined. I have two heroes.

And I thank you very much for your likeness, which I have so long wanted to possess. It is a little older and more matronly than I had thought of you as being, but the suggestion of the face is full of that immortal comfort that does not ever grow old, that does not ever decay. I can almost fancy it - or rather almost discern it - as the incarnate expression of Mrs. Browning's solemn triumphal chant: \"Glory to God, to God, she saith; Knowledge by suffering entereth, And life is perfected by death.\" That I shall take good care of it I need not assure you, for that you know already. Certainly, dear friend, I shall be as careful of my health as circumstances, and reference to duty, permit.

My dear friend, I snatch a moment in which to reassure you of my perfect confidence in your friendship and the friendship of your Sister, tho not only one letter, but an hundred fail. I should indeed be unworthy the sympathy of such as you did I suffer these mishaps of circumstance to engender a doubting spirit. - If the fellowships that link us together mean anything at all - if they are not mere pleasant make-beliefs and delightful cheats, - they must certainly have root in the soul, since neither has seen the other, or heard the sound of that other's voice, or watched that other's especial manner and ways. Well, the soul knows: is certain- reliant - assured. You cannot fail me, if I am in your worlds. Why then should I doubt? Say this also to your Sister. You have, I trust, already heard of my return to my Regt. I was not quite i time for the charge of the 27th, in which my noble Colonel lost his life; but should have been except for the destruction of the train at Ringold and again at Kingston, caused by the interference of guerrillas along the road. The weather is exceedingly hot - almost unendurable - ranging from 110 upwards. Men are sun-struck and die, every day. For myself, having suffered from coup de soleil once, in Kentucky, I am obliged to be very careful, the moreso as my general health is by no means re-established. We have crossed the river - are entrenched - and await the crossing of those Corps still on the other side - then forward to Atlanta. I must be brief, for I have much work to do.

We are still in the trenches, still narrowing and tightening around the fated city the lines of circumvallation fighting by piecemeal, here and there, but making, I trust, the final result sure.\n[vertical text begin] omit all but the last two paragraphs. [vertical text end] I know what you mean, dear friend, and it will be enough of joy, and bring enough of blessed recompense, that you give me leave to walk hand in hand with you accomplishing the uses and delights of this spiritual friendship born out of worthy recognition of the worthy soul. How much I thank you for your solicitude respecting my welfare in those days of sickness when I was nigh unto death, and for your anxiety about my safety in these hours when the air is all alive with the blazing wrath of battle. It comforts me, exceedingly, this abiding sense of abiding fellowship, this knowledge of your faith and trust that I shall not stave nor mar the grandeur and justice of the Cause in which I try to do my duty.

All my life long I have loved beauty with a wonderful passion, and I think I can understand how poor Shelly felt when he exclaimed addressing the Spirit of Nature, \"O awful loveliness!\" I know, indeed, that this inborn reverence for purity and symmetry of form and color, has had something to do with keeping my life clean amid the sensualism and savageism of a soldier's existence. Everything beautiful is to me a revelation from God; but I do not think I have ever looked into the face of a woman, and found there the perfect embodiment of my ideal vision. I do not regret this. I think it is all right. There is, to me, and unutterable sanctity about the satisfiedness of young mated souls, all a-tremble with excess of Peace. It is very holy. But I know it will not last; and that, as new powers are born, new tendernesses developed, new wants recognized, their ideals will grow also, and bye and bye they will smile as they look back and see with what weak nectar they were once","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":53623,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/53623","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/abd3e682d935e2469a0092721dfc26c9.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/abd3e682d935e2469a0092721dfc26c9.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/abd3e682d935e2469a0092721dfc26c9.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/abd3e682d935e2469a0092721dfc26c9.jpg"},"added":"2017-12-20T18:20:07+00:00","modified":"2019-11-12T21:22:48+00:00","filename":"abd3e682d935e2469a0092721dfc26c9.jpg","authentication":"d0ff2547f1966a619cf444c196a0e887","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/civilwarletters\/archive\/fullsize\/5f2c4e83597b43ffebc793f809442fb2.jpg","size":276907,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":800,"resolution_y":739,"compression_ratio":0.15612708615246},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"abd3e682d935e2469a0092721dfc26c9.jpg","FileDateTime":1513794007,"FileSize":276907,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"800\" height=\"739\"","Height":739,"Width":800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":2593,"ImageLength":2301,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"Compression":1,"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Orientation":1,"UndefinedTag:0x0001":"\u0003","XResolution":350,"YResolution":350,"PlanarConfiguration":1,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2013:05:31 14:31:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":256},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":394,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":10200},"EXIF":{"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2286,"ExifImageLength":2111}}}},"item":{"id":823,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/823","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Richard Realf to Laura B.

For a week past we have been under a blockade of ice and snow, rendering the roads impracticable for man or beast; but inasmuch as the weather is now moderating I presume the Marching Orders under which we have laid for some days will soon be carried out, and that another battle will soon be fought. It is useless to speculate. That the rebels fight as fiercely as ever their repeated charges at Franklin shows; and that the Union soldiers possess the sturdiness which secures ultimate victory, and the readiness that baffles the most frenzied impetuosity, is demonstrated by the same battle. But I am sorry to see in the North such a spirit of foolish ecstasy over our successes, and foolish depression over our failures and reverses. this is not wise, not well.

She is exceedingly good to me and would like to be very intimate with me but\nPlease give my respect to Mrs John and Miss Charlotte Marsh","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":40980,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/40980","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c2ef174a294ba2193b9e70b2bbd10493.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/c2ef174a294ba2193b9e70b2bbd10493.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/c2ef174a294ba2193b9e70b2bbd10493.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c2ef174a294ba2193b9e70b2bbd10493.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T17:36:21+00:00","modified":"2020-03-29T00:29:35+00:00","filename":"c2ef174a294ba2193b9e70b2bbd10493.jpg","authentication":"da30230d0cac0f6994c6d32025dd49db","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_039_002_03_o2.jpg","size":1489018,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2824,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048821542860141},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024153"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024153"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024153"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c2ef174a294ba2193b9e70b2bbd10493.jpg","FileDateTime":1509384746,"FileSize":1489018,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2824\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2824,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:24 14:51:00","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:24 02:41:53","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:24 02:41:53","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":2,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3313,"ExifImageLength":4222,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":176,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/176","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I do not board with her and take no notice of her except to treat her civilly and politely. when I meet her neither shall I make her a friend untill she gives me as good reasons for changing my present opinions concerning her as she did for forming them.

I have not time to give you any advice as to your future course. I was in hopes that you would have wisdom so sufficient about you to come out here before I left that I might give you the wealth of my experience, but as you have done differently I do not see but that you must grope your way in dark as I have done. In reference to a Music Teacher, all that I can tell you is that Miss Franks will not do. The People will not send their Scholars to her. Miss Cicel might give the Lessons - but you then loose the tuition, & also would loose the Music Club from the School - I must confess that I don't admire your arrangement for Teachers. The Primary department I could cut loose from The School - it now amts to nothing since Helen left it , it has cost me more than $100 out of Pocket- in fact it has done nothing since Josephine Stedman had it - She broke it up - and I believe she will break up any school. However much you may think of her as a woman, don't be fooled as to think, that hence, she is a good Teacher. And again I hope she will treat you differently from what she has me - her bills for her school amounted to about $70 dolls. I took them and gave her sixty-six dolls for them - twenty-five dolls of them I shall never get a cent of  & for collecting most of the rest it has cost me 10 per cent. While she was teaching she was in school and for this I charged her only half price. When she left here I gave her $20, I know I overpaid her, but could not stop to go down to the house and get the Books, and see- it has run along till now  as she had not been","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":41003,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/41003","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/4041a96f83ba04ae3075dac4c7423f8b.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/4041a96f83ba04ae3075dac4c7423f8b.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/4041a96f83ba04ae3075dac4c7423f8b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4041a96f83ba04ae3075dac4c7423f8b.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T17:37:36+00:00","modified":"2020-04-08T16:29:48+00:00","filename":"4041a96f83ba04ae3075dac4c7423f8b.jpg","authentication":"60832760560cbd0c63f317f26b5b903e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_02_fl_039_009_02_o2.jpg","size":1659509,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2849,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.053934096434096},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024641"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024641"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170724"],"TimeCreated":["024641"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["134252"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4041a96f83ba04ae3075dac4c7423f8b.jpg","FileDateTime":1509384747,"FileSize":1659509,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2849\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2849,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"20mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:24 14:52:07","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:24 02:46:41","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:24 02:46:41","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":2,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3273,"ExifImageLength":4135,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"TAMRON SP 28-75mm F\/2.8 Di A09E","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":176,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/176","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"here since when I made my bills out I made out hers and there was\n$10 or between 9 and 10 due me from her -

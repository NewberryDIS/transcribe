Printing, education, pioneer life, and religion are all discussed within the letters. Included are the papers of Robert Everett, the pastor of Welsh Congregationalist churches in Oneida County, New York, and publisher of Y Cenhadwr Americanaidd (The American Missionary), a Welsh religious reform magazine that was pro-abolition. Also included are letters and materials of Mary Everett, a graduate of New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, who was also involved in the suffrage movement, John Roberts and Sarah Colgrove Everett, pioneers who moved to Kansas Territory in 1854 and were active in abolitionist activities, and Cynthia Everett, a member of the American Missionary Association who taught freedmen in Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina, following the Civil War.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/mms.newberry.org\/xml\/xml_files\/Everett.xml#series2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<br \/><br \/><\/a> Edward Williams Everett (1843-1920) was the youngest of the 11 Everett children. He lived in Turin, NY, where he married Mary Allen in 1869. The couple had four sons, Jay Carroll, Charles, Robert, and Edward. In 1885 the family moved to Olpe, KS, south of Emporia, where Edward opened a general store near the home of his brother John Roberts Everett. He also served as postmaster at Olpe, from 1893 until 1897. Two more sons, Ray and Harry, were born in Kansas.

Chandler. I suppose will Start for the West in a few weeks if he comes this spring and it will be necessary for us to make our arrangements for where you & the children & I shall spend the summer. I wish I knew what was for the best in this matter. I suppose I shall have to see that the farm is carried on this season & I do not think we can rent it or sell it this spring. You want to do some more visiting in New England.Where do you want to go and how long do you want to remain in Each place & how long will it take you to get through all your visit. After you get through visiting do you want to remain in New England or do you want to come back to me. I, dear wife, would be very glad indeed to see you & have you with me & if you decide to return this spring I will try & get passes & go out after you & I promise you such a hugging & kissing as you have not had this many a day. But if you prefer remaining in New England, tell me whether you prefer boarding or keeping house. Get you a good comfortable situation & I will do all I can for you. I will if possible visit you in the spring and will send you all the means I can & will write you often & contribute all I can to your happiness there, but dear wife I say from my inmost heart that there is nothing on Earth I so long for as to have you with me contented & happy provided you prefer being with me to anywhere else. Now dear Wife tell me frankly what your wishes are as regards your home, your living East or West, & ll other subjects which have a bearing upon what I have written & I will do all I can to gratify your wishes. I wrote you & sent a letter Monday the 15th. How do you like lines copied in it as my valentine to you. Have you had your \"Menses\" since you left. Now dear good wife, just place your arms about me as in days \"lang syne\" & Exchange with me warm loving Kisses of affection.. With much love I remain your affectionate husband N. Kendall\n[left-hand side] Tell Eddie, Winnie & \"Ba\" that I love them very much & think of them often. Tell Eddie his \"two or three loves\" came safely for which I thank him. Has Winnie words of affection for me. Remember me kindly to all. Do Mary & Winnie think as much of Each other as they used to. I hope so.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":39875,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/39875","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d75ef346a3cf292e24a48fa33517a4d4.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d75ef346a3cf292e24a48fa33517a4d4.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d75ef346a3cf292e24a48fa33517a4d4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d75ef346a3cf292e24a48fa33517a4d4.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-30T15:40:23+00:00","modified":"2020-04-19T05:08:18+00:00","filename":"d75ef346a3cf292e24a48fa33517a4d4.jpg","authentication":"312a6f03b156592fe22a6ab266af7e06","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_kendall_reed_box_01_fl_15_018_01_o2.jpg","size":1232498,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2310,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049402677569344},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170713"],"TimeCreated":["233020"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170713"],"TimeCreated":["233020"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170713"],"TimeCreated":["233020"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d75ef346a3cf292e24a48fa33517a4d4.jpg","FileDateTime":1509377453,"FileSize":1232498,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2310\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2310,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"17mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:07:14 15:09:12","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:07:13 23:30:20","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:07:13 23:30:20","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":38,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2848,"ExifImageLength":4438,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":170,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/170","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"La Porte Ind Feb17\/64\nMy own dear, good Wife\n\n     Your letter written the 7, 8 & 9- reached me this morning bringing the sad intelligence of the death of little Clara.

it necessary to cut away from his horse to get out, Notice having been given last Evening of a meeting today, a considerable Number of People collected, and we were favour'd with a solid satisfactory Opportunity amoung them, which I desire may be thankfully remembered, after Dinner we had a comfortable Opportunity with the few who professed with us, & the Love of the Brethren was felt to the tendering of our Hearts together, and in the Evening we had a solid Opportunity at John Hill's, a friend who moved from Bucks County.\nBefore we took Leave, it appear'd almost inexpressibly rejoicing to Friends here, remote, & scattered in a Wilderness Country, for to see their Brethren, in the Evening a Messenger came to invite us to dine next day with Governor Simco.\n20 2\nWe rode to Navy-Hall

Brother, Now we are conversing together in order to make the Chain bright, when we told you what would give satisfaction, you proposed reserving of this piece between Buffalo Creek & John's Landing, for building houses, &, but we apprehend you would not only build houses but towns, you told us these houses would be to accommodate travellers in Winter, as they cannot go by water in that season, and that the travellers would want a staff in travelling that road, we have taken these matters into Consideration, we conclude we do not understand this as the white People do, if we consent, we know it will injure us, if these houses should be built, they would lend to scatter us, & make us fall in the Streets, alluding to rum instead of benefiting us, you want places to raise provisions, hay &, but as soon as they settle, then they would think the land theirs, for this is the way of the white People, you mention when you get Possession of that Country, you would want landing Places, Hores fields to plant in, &, but we wish to be the sole owners of this land ourselves, you requested a road, but when you settle with the Brittish, you can pass & repass by water, as the great Spirit has made that road, we have made up our minds, we wish to be the sole owners of the Land, what you want to reserve is entirely in your own favour, you told us when you left Phila, it was not expected by the United States, you would release a foot of land, we thank them in having left you at liberty, to give up what you please, you have waited with patience at this Council fire kindled by general Washington, it is but a very small thing that keeps the chain from being brightned, if you will consent to give up this small piece, & have no houses on it, the Chain will be made bright, as to harbours, the water is between you & the Brittish, you must talk to them, of the same Colour, I see there are many of yor people now here, waiting with their

you are tell us so, that those of our nation who have become your children and have determined to die so, may know what to do. In this case, one chief has said, he would ask you to put him out of his pain. Another who would not think of dying by the hand of his father, or his brother, has said he will retire to the Chata[??]]ghque, eat of the fatal root and sleep with his fathers in peace. Before you determine a measure so unjust look up to God who made us as well as you; we hope he unknown not permit you to destroy the whole of our nation.\nFather. Hear our case: many nations inhabited this country but they had no wisdom, therefore they warred together; The six nations were powerful, and compelled them to peace. The land for a great ex__?? was given up tp them but the nations which were not destroyed, all continued on their lands and claimed the protection of the six nations as brothers of their fathers. They were men. and when at peace had a right to live upon the earth. The French came among us and built Niagara: they became our fathers, and took care of us. Sir William Johnson came, and took that fort from the French he became our father and promised to take care of us, and he did so, untill you were too strong for his king. To him we gave four miles round Niagara, as a place of trade. We have already said how we came to join against you, we said that we were wrong, we wished for peace, you demanded a great country to be given up to you, it was surrendered to you, as the price of peace, and we ought to have peace and possession of the little land which you then left us.\nFather, when the great country was given up to you, there were but few chiefs present-and they were compelled to give it up. And it is not the six nations only that reproach those chiefs which  having given up that country: the Chipaways, and all the six nations who lived on the lands westward, called to us and ask us-Brothers of our Fathers, where is the place which you have reserved for us to lie down upon?\nFather, you have compelled to do that which makes us ashamed we have nothing to answer to the children of the brothers of our fathers.  When last spring they called upon us to go to war to secure them a bed to lay down upon, the Senecas  unknown them to be quiet until we had spoken to you, but on our way down, we  heard that your army had gone towards the country which those nations inhabited and if they meet together the best blood on both sides  will stain the ground","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":68490,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/68490","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/33557539597cbab1885792445c08447d.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/33557539597cbab1885792445c08447d.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/33557539597cbab1885792445c08447d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/33557539597cbab1885792445c08447d.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-28T15:09:13+00:00","modified":"2020-03-26T01:26:04+00:00","filename":"33557539597cbab1885792445c08447d.jpg","authentication":"fb3bea29593184beb9727792952cc763","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":140,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3146_00072_o2.jpg","size":1168708,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":3029,"compression_ratio":0.071451768704988},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["125155+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["125155+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G","\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0002"],"DateCreated":["20120627"],"TimeCreated":["125155+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"33557539597cbab1885792445c08447d.jpg","FileDateTime":1522249617,"FileSize":1168708,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"3029\"","Height":3029,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":3029,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:27 16:41:22","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":814,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6041},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:27 12:51:55","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:27 12:51:55","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":10,"SubSecTimeDigitized":10,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":3029,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0}}}},"item":{"id":1026,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1026","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Father, We will not conceal from you, that the Great Gods and not men has preserved the Corn Plant from the hands of his own nation.

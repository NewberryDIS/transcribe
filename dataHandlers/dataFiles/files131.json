N. Gordon St.\nGouverneur, N.Y.\nMar. 30, 1913.\nDear Aunt Mary,\nWe left Adams yesterday morning and came safely Gouverneur, We had heard of the terrible ice and wind storm in Gouverneur so came right through without stopping in Watertown as we had planned. Our house and trees had escaped serious damage though there was one large limb down in our front lawn and two on our back-yard.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":31329,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/31329","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7b594193420d141c4ee78e4a71f280b3.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7b594193420d141c4ee78e4a71f280b3.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7b594193420d141c4ee78e4a71f280b3.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7b594193420d141c4ee78e4a71f280b3.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-09T17:13:41+00:00","modified":"2019-10-29T20:51:58+00:00","filename":"7b594193420d141c4ee78e4a71f280b3.jpg","authentication":"88c036dd9d05ab4a1834686039712659","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_07_fl_220_014_02_o2.jpg","size":1386894,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2426,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.052933269213154},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160219"],"TimeCreated":["035902"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160219"],"TimeCreated":["035902"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160219"],"TimeCreated":["035902"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7b594193420d141c4ee78e4a71f280b3.jpg","FileDateTime":1507569192,"FileSize":1386894,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2426\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2426,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"16mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:02:23 09:52:44","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:19 03:59:02","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:19 03:59:02","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":12,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2622,"ExifImageLength":3890,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":131,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/131","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The electric light wires are down all over the village so we have no lights yet.

Goss, who once had a tuberculosis hospital there. He told me that my cough was nothing to be alarmed about but that I still had the grippe. He said that if I were coughing and raising like that with tubercular trouble I woudln't be worth shipping to Gouverneur He gave me some cough medicine and ordered a mustard paste on my chest which Mrs. Pitcher put on for me.

Y.\nMay 21\" 1893\nMy dear cousins\nI am so sorry to have to write you that Josie had to lose her beautiful babe. Labor began Friday the 19\" at two P. M. and she came right on, so I sent for the doctor and nurse (whom she had engaged for a week or two) as she thought I was not strong enough to have all the care of her & babe at first. The pains were hard & frequent almost constant, but not expulsive. About half past nine the doctor applied forceps without effect. At half past ten we telephoned for Dr. Kilborn and at two o'clock after the hardest struggle I ever saw with all my experience, the child was brought into the world. A large head, well formed body with a growth of four or six weeks. That with a narrow pelvis was the cause of all the trouble.

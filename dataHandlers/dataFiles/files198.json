is an institution of God, deriving authority from Him, and from any imagined compact of individuals in the origin of states. Without a man could not fulfil his destiny as a social being. Communities of men may mould their governments into such forms as they prefer; but be the form what it may, authority is exercised by a divine right: Power is the ordinance of God; and the depositary in whom it is vested is \"the minister of God\"\nIn the first form of government instituted among men, God was the Constituent, & the Patriarch was his representative. A purely paternal Authority was exercised in the spirit of love and beneficence, in virtue of the divine warrant_ \"He shall rule over thee.\" Obedience was filial, and grew out of necessity, habit, and affection. The domestic nucleus, augmented by the adhesion of servants and dependants swilled into a Principality.

                     Wednesday Morning. 22\n\nMy Dear Matilda.\nI have been as cross as I could be this morning because I was disappointed in going out to Flatbrush last evening. But the raids and mud and a dislike to ask mr Hall for permission to leave before light restrained me.\nThen in addition to my disappointment last evening, you have forbidden me to come out before next Sunday; however my consolation is that a week from Tomorrow I can come out as often I please; except that I shall be obliged to come whenever you say- that is, you can bid me come but not forbid my coming.\nOn Monday I spoke to Mr. John hall about leaving for a truck, and as I expected he readily consented, and I have now got consent to leave at that time.

Sunday Evening 19th Jauy? [1851]\nMy dear Matilda [Tilly]\nMy regular day for writing to you is Wednesday, and therefore on Wednesday next I shall send you a longer letter. Mr Smith the mate of the Southport (which leaves tomorrow) kindly offers to take this letter to the house. I gladly accepted his offer thinking you would be pleased to see any one who had seen me here.\nYesterday and to day have been cold and stormy and consequently I have not stirred from the house I am now sitting close to a comfortable, cheerful fire of wood in my own room. Every thing is quiet, my room mate, young Dr Bronsow having gone out to Church, and I am as cosy and comfortable as I can expect to be away from you.\nI have not been here long enough to form any just estimate of the effect the climate is going to have upon me. Yet I must say that I feel encouraged. The excrutiating pains in my chest, side, shoulders &c which I had before leaving home and which I had so severely on board ship have entirely. My expectoration and coughing are much less- and I can lay a good deal on the right side, which you may recollect I could scarcely do before leaving home. Tomorrow if the weather will permit I will weigh myself and see whether I have gained or lost since I landed.

Sometimes, however, error is the judicial consequence of sin, as in the case of the idolatrous Jews.  \"Ye have chosen your own ways,\" said the Almighty, \"and I will chuse your delusions!\"  Such also is the case of those who are \"given up to strong delusions, to believe a lie, that they may be damned; because they obeyed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\"  On the other hand,","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":45013,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/45013","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/5c2d2ba96ad042276162c54da21f0ed7.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/5c2d2ba96ad042276162c54da21f0ed7.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/5c2d2ba96ad042276162c54da21f0ed7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5c2d2ba96ad042276162c54da21f0ed7.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-01T20:02:11+00:00","modified":"2020-04-06T22:23:30+00:00","filename":"5c2d2ba96ad042276162c54da21f0ed7.jpg","authentication":"13092762901698fac5ecf52ef998aa4d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_41_fl_03_01_030_o2.jpg","size":1442101,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2821,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.047333523704491},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170926"],"TimeCreated":["222444"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["847210"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170926"],"TimeCreated":["222444"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["847210"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170926"],"TimeCreated":["222444"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["847210"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5c2d2ba96ad042276162c54da21f0ed7.jpg","FileDateTime":1509566419,"FileSize":1442101,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2821\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2821,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:09:27 10:20:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:09:26 22:24:44","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:09:26 22:24:44","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":35,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2376,"ExifImageLength":3032,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":198,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/198","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"determined integrity of principle, & purity of life, are as favorable to the increase of light in the understanding, as of grace in the heart.

Mr Smith the mate of the Southport (which leaves tomorrow) kindly offers to take this letter to the house. I gladly accepted his offer thinking you would be pleased to see any one who had seen me here.\nYesterday and to day have been cold and stormy and consequently I have not stirred from the house.  I am now sitting close to a comfortable, cheerful fire of wood in my own room. Every thing is quiet, my room mate, young Dr Bronson having gone out to Church, and I am as cosy and comfortable as I can expect to be away from you.\nI have not been here long enough to form any just estimate of the effect the climate is going to have upon me. Yet I must say that I feel encouraged. The excrutiating pains in my chest, side, shoulders to which I had before leaving home, and which I had so severely on board ship have entirely. My expectoration and coughing are much less- and I can lay a good deal on the right side, which you may recollect I could scarcely do before leaving home. Tomorrow if the weather will permit I will weigh myself and see whether I have gained or lost since I landed. My appetite is quite good.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":45082,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/45082","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/844f604a2742250439a297b6b5743315.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/844f604a2742250439a297b6b5743315.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/844f604a2742250439a297b6b5743315.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/844f604a2742250439a297b6b5743315.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-01T20:06:11+00:00","modified":"2020-03-26T03:18:04+00:00","filename":"844f604a2742250439a297b6b5743315.jpg","authentication":"2a2a54a9e7ac8254289eb356b19ffe2a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_41_fl_05_02_002_o2.jpg","size":1458384,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2850,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.04738089668616},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170926"],"TimeCreated":["223706"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["847210"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170926"],"TimeCreated":["223706"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["847210"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170926"],"TimeCreated":["223706"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["847210"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"844f604a2742250439a297b6b5743315.jpg","FileDateTime":1509566423,"FileSize":1458384,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2850\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2850,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:09:27 10:21:31","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:09:26 22:37:06","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:09:26 22:37:06","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3401,"ExifImageLength":4296,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":198,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/198","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I have had to day a slight attack of the blues because of not having rec'd a letter which I fully expected to have rec'd yesterday.

However I hope to derive benefit even during the winter - and if I had you here to look round for ? very soon, so that if it should please God that I should be spared for a time, I may be able to stay here next winter and have you with me.

Last week I was behind hand two days for reasons which I explained.  With your last I also received? a letter from Bery?.  I have answered it to day endeavoring to dissuade him from attempting to go to Chicago, but rather to put the ? into the hands of Mr Sherwood, who can do it as well as either of us, and Send? Bery a heavy bill of expense.\nThursday 6th  On the evening before yesterday I began this letter ~ it was then cloudy and raining~ during the night it cleared off and yesterday morning was a beautiful Summers morning and so it continued all day.  The first thing I determined to do, was to return the Calls of the Rev. ? White andMacauley.  So about two o'clock I walked out to Mr Whites and found Mr Macauley with him.

March 1851 My dearest Tilly I have just received your letter dated Mch 4th. It has cut me to the heart, for I perceive that I have written to you as I ought not to have done. Forgive me my dear, dear one, if I in the selfish consideration of my own troubles have been unmindful of yours. Believe me my dear wife. I know the depth, the purity of your affection for me far better than I have deserved. When I think of you and my dear little ones my heart is full. If it is the will of God that I must leave you all, O may I be prepared for the change, and your heart be strengthened by this Grace, to bear up under the trial--But still let us hope for the best, perhaps I may be allowed to see any happy days with you yet. In my letter of the 26.th ? I spoke of our having a few few days, and of my feeling quite well from that time up to last Friday. the weather was most delightful, and had a wonderful effect upon me. I felt well almost. I coughed but little, raised but little, had but fear of those short spells of fever & did not for several days lye down during the day. Since last Friday we had a cold rain, which slightly added to my cough, but the weather is now clear again - crossed out and I shall feel well again. The principal bad feature in my care? is my inability to endure much fatigue. For my cough & spitting has never been as bad here, as it was before I left home, and indeed most of the time I feel quite strong.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":45101,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/45101","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/e5ea3e67f61c54dd805063bab3a75602.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/e5ea3e67f61c54dd805063bab3a75602.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/e5ea3e67f61c54dd805063bab3a75602.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e5ea3e67f61c54dd805063bab3a75602.jpg"},"added":"2017-11-01T20:07:18+00:00","modified":"2020-03-28T19:09:15+00:00","filename":"e5ea3e67f61c54dd805063bab3a75602.jpg","authentication":"d110e0302c13df0709b2c00b8d70ff88","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_41_fl_05_08_002_o2.jpg","size":1265352,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2861,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.040951493261874},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170926"],"TimeCreated":["223936"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["847210"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170926"],"TimeCreated":["223936"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["847210"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20170926"],"TimeCreated":["223936"],"OriginalTransmissionReference":["Midwest Collections"],"Credit":["847210"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e5ea3e67f61c54dd805063bab3a75602.jpg","FileDateTime":1509566424,"FileSize":1265352,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2861\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2861,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"21mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/8.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2017:09:27 10:21:43","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":8,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2017:09:26 22:39:36","DateTimeDigitized":"2017:09:26 22:39:36","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":6,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":3469,"ExifImageLength":4364,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":198,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/198","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"until I happened to overexert myself a little, when I completely prostrated until I have obtained rest.\nIf you could have been with me my dear one, I believe that I should had improved much more than I have.

I shall do it up nicely and send it to you by the Steamer \"Florida\" which sails on Saturday next, and will reach New York sometime on Tuesday the 8th of April. I shall direct it to \"Mrs MK Barlow 27 Butter St. Brooklyn\". and put in charge of the clerk of the Boat, telling him that you're Father will call for it.

He would allow you the use of the room, and have you obtain all you could from your pupils.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":22032,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/22032","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/6b2472d40bf73f0d8062f29651fa6483.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/6b2472d40bf73f0d8062f29651fa6483.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/6b2472d40bf73f0d8062f29651fa6483.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6b2472d40bf73f0d8062f29651fa6483.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-04T17:40:24+00:00","modified":"2020-01-25T06:47:45+00:00","filename":"6b2472d40bf73f0d8062f29651fa6483.jpg","authentication":"206b857e7d840eeef0f9ab862c5d5a0b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_10_fl_375_010_03_o2.jpg","size":979152,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2137,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042424998700151},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160225"],"TimeCreated":["031421"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160225"],"DigitalCreationTime":["031421"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160225"],"TimeCreated":["031421"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160225"],"DigitalCreationTime":["031421"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160225"],"TimeCreated":["031421"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160225"],"DigitalCreationTime":["031421"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6b2472d40bf73f0d8062f29651fa6483.jpg","FileDateTime":1507138699,"FileSize":979152,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2137\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2137,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:06:24 13:44:21","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:25 03:14:21","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:25 03:14:21","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":85,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/85","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"He said he would aid you all he could to obtain scholars, and thought you might get a class of 18 or 20.

I was very much pleased with it. The teacher says the improvement in the language of the inmates since its opening is wonderful so that cursing is the exception instead of the rule. She heard them recite the 10 commandments while I was there, and I assure I never heard a more pretty little sermon than those she gave after the recitation of each commandment. About 35 of the present inmates are under 18 yrs of age. Quite an effort is being made to organize a reorm school which will be so much better a place to take the many little vagrants that now are taken to the jail.\n\n Last Sat. afternoon Miss Martin and I attended service in a small colored chapel standing ever so far back from the street in a most lovely grove.

We received a letter from you and Jennie this week, which did us lots of good.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":22179,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/22179","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d2eb5a370ddd21e411549c5bef5907ba.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d2eb5a370ddd21e411549c5bef5907ba.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d2eb5a370ddd21e411549c5bef5907ba.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d2eb5a370ddd21e411549c5bef5907ba.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-04T17:47:10+00:00","modified":"2020-04-18T20:03:11+00:00","filename":"d2eb5a370ddd21e411549c5bef5907ba.jpg","authentication":"d77cc5e2f3b6bdf8115b1847984e4b1c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_10_fl_380_006_03_o2.jpg","size":1071776,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2224,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044621636024514},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160225"],"TimeCreated":["033148"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160225"],"DigitalCreationTime":["033148"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160225"],"TimeCreated":["033148"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160225"],"DigitalCreationTime":["033148"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160225"],"TimeCreated":["033148"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160225"],"DigitalCreationTime":["033148"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d2eb5a370ddd21e411549c5bef5907ba.jpg","FileDateTime":1507138704,"FileSize":1071776,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2224\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2224,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:06:24 14:30:19","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:02:25 03:31:48","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:02:25 03:31:48","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":63,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":85,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/85","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I should like first rate to have some buttermilk.

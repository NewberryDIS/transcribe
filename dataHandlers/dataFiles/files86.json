June 11.'58.\nDear Mother,\nI received your letter yesterday, and am very sorry that you have been so needlessly concerned about my health. My back does not trouble me at all now, and it does not see at all probably that it will, for Elisabeth will not let me do anything that can harm it. If I were with your mother, you could not be more careful of me, and I dare say you would not be so careful as Elisabeth is. Indeed the work that I do is so trifling as scarcely to deserve the name. I am speaking honestly, too - With regard to the house-cleaning, it was a little affair anyway. One could not well hurt herself with that, much less three. You know sister does not let her house get very dirty, nor did we clean it very thoroughly. What made me feel poorly, was chiefly this, I think.

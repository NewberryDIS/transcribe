A dispatch arrived here yesterday from MacKenzie to Augur, stating that the Indians attacked him on the night of the 26th Sept. and again on the night of the 27th, and that on the 28th he struck them in a long Canon at the head of the Red river, where they could see him a long way off.  He claims to have killed 3 Indians whose bodies he got and captured 1400 ponies, mules & colts, about 1000 of which he had shot & kept the balance.\n\n    Sheridan is between here and Caddo and expected in tomorrow.\n    Davidson has made a strong recommendation to Augur for the establishment of a catonment on McClellan Creek, to consist of about 12 companies, Cavalry & infantry.  He made this recommendation in a letter to Augur while we were out, and which has not yet reached him as he left here before it arrived.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":66321,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/66321","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/bc73c34841f57e365b1ab2812f3ee1c6.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/bc73c34841f57e365b1ab2812f3ee1c6.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/bc73c34841f57e365b1ab2812f3ee1c6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/bc73c34841f57e365b1ab2812f3ee1c6.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-24T18:12:19+00:00","modified":"2020-01-29T21:26:10+00:00","filename":"bc73c34841f57e365b1ab2812f3ee1c6.jpg","authentication":"a65a0057f97b7a209f2eca3f867ff379","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3039_BX03_FL140_00021_o2.jpg","size":560025,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2268,"compression_ratio":0.045726778365667},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120611"],"TimeCreated":["102333+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120611"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120611"],"TimeCreated":["102333+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120611"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120611"],"TimeCreated":["102333+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120611"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"bc73c34841f57e365b1ab2812f3ee1c6.jpg","FileDateTime":1521915096,"FileSize":560025,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2268\"","Height":2268,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2268,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:24 08:51:44","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6884},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:11 10:23:33","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:11 10:23:33","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":30,"SubSecTimeDigitized":30,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2268,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1007,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1007","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"He undoubtedly intends to make the same recommendation to Sheridan and urge it in such a way that he Davidson will perhaps be ordered to establish it, as he has nine companies now here available, though badly broken down.

All the companies in the field are rationed to the end of August, which is 35 days away.  Crevensten's train left here with Nolan's command and above 45000 pounds of forage.  As you sent more over with Baldwin, the troops of Eagle Springs and Quntran have forage, at the note of nine pounds per ration, to cash until August 20th at least Shannon left here with 35000 pounds of forage and Lebo's company.  As all the forage on Shannon's train went with Lebo he is foraged for at least 45 days from the time he left or until the 5th of September.  (Confet) has written me that he has forage for his and Bladwin's companies to include August 4th.  Jones has probably joined him by this time as he left his camp in the Chivatis ont he 25th, to go there.

N. Indian territory [Jan'y?] 18, 1868\nMy dear Mrs. Grierson \nI received your very interesting letter last Tuesday night only a week after it was mailed at Riley. It is so nice to get your long newsey letters, and Henry is always as glad to get them as I am.  I thought of you at Christmas and wondered what night your entertainment would come off.  I knew it would be pleasant and nice.  Now I must tell you of our doings since I wrote you last - the first thing worth recording is the way we spent thanksgiving.  By special invitation Henry and I dined at Major Kimball's - we were living in a tent there and that morning had a call from Col. Floyd. Jones and Lieut. Munson - the adjutant of the Post - They staid a long time and went home in the rain for it was raining fast.  We started soon after and got to Major Kimballs one way  while his carriage came another way for us to ride over.  I wore  Lt. Harmons rubber coat and my short black dress - and did not suffer at all.  The Major and Mrs. Kimball, Doctor and Mrs. Crary and their little girl and Henry and I made up the party at dinner.  About seven o'clock all (but two)of the garrison officers - and Lt. Harmon - came by invitation to spend the evening.  Mrs. Kimball had cake, apples -\nMarginal note: This is another long letter and miserably written but gives you views of us and that is what you want.

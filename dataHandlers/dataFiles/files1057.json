The Resolution respecting School Committee was there again reformed.\nFriday 31st.\nThe following objections were recd from the Principal Chief to the Resolution passed by the Two House the present session, regulating the issuing of permits.\nunclear Lewis Ross Presdt Comm                 Head of Coosa CN Oct 1828\nSo I returned you in yesterday the resolution regulating the issuing of permits to and not being prepared, from the sudden manner in which I was called home, to state the objections, which influenced me in disapproving it, I will now give you a brief statement. In the first place I am inclined to believe that the that the tax required to be paid, the length of time that one should be compelled to take on permit for, & the condition of giving bond & security, would all go to operate with the felling of some of our people, so as to employ whitemen without permits, and hazard the risk of being returned to count & fined according to law. - You will see that their late resolution imposes no penalty for hiring without permit, & you will further see that the law imposing a penalty for such offence leaves not, then obvious, that a great many of our citizens would live without permits, & rather pay the Ten Dollars than to be forced in the sum prescribed in this resolution? In the second place, I am of opinion that the expense of removing the white people who may be introduced into this nation under permits should not altogether fall upon the nation or the sheriff; but the employer, or the obstinate white man should pay the necessary expence of removal. I consider this subject one of great importance, and that it is highly necessary we should guard against being overburdened with temporary citizens of this character. And at the same time, we should not suffer the improvement of the mechanical art, to languish through a contracted policy of legislation. There for I respectfully submit the subject for your reconsideration. \nYour servant, John Ross.\nThe resolution was then taken up & read with the objections. On motion of Jos Daniel, the resolution was laid on the table to be read again on Monday next.\nMonday 3rd Nov:\nThe house met agreeably to adjournment. - The resolution regulating the issuing of permits was takin up and read the Second time, with the objections thereto made by the principal Chief. David Vann moved that the resolution be so amended that the tax of five dollars for each permit be reduced to one dollar & in proportion for unclear a greater length of time. Jos Vann (Coosawattie) moved that the tax remain at what it is, for one year; and for 6 months, be $3, & for 3 months, $2, & that no permits be issued for a less term than 3 months.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71176,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/71176","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/4fd17ddcd113b128369307d11969826f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/4fd17ddcd113b128369307d11969826f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/4fd17ddcd113b128369307d11969826f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/4fd17ddcd113b128369307d11969826f.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T16:04:19+00:00","modified":"2020-03-21T16:52:55+00:00","filename":"4fd17ddcd113b128369307d11969826f.jpg","authentication":"f3dda823b8bd4587288d20f0c4690654","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL07_FL006_00007_o2.jpg","size":897981,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2936,"compression_ratio":0.056639229488344},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["124701+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["124701+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["124701+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"4fd17ddcd113b128369307d11969826f.jpg","FileDateTime":1522425844,"FileSize":897981,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2936\"","Height":2936,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2936,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:15:18","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4876},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 12:47:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 12:47:01","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":32,"SubSecTimeDigitized":32,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2936,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1057,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1057","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"The ayes and nays being taken were as follows: for David Vann's amendment II: for Jos Vann's 4.

honours on a subject in which we believe the intent of this nation is deeply involved. The subject to which we respectfully solicit your attention, is the resolution passed by the General Council of the Nation on the 24th of October 1827, requiring the Treasurer to call in all the money loaned under the provision of a previous act, on or before the first Monday of Oct 1828.\nWe hope this will not be viewed as casting reflections on the Honorable Members of the General Council, by whom the above recited resolution was formed, for we are well assured that the Loan Bank was highly commendable: _ the object was for a general good, to augment the national fund, and to circulate money amongst the citizens of this nation. But we do most sincerely believe that if immediate collections of the loaned money are made, which will have to be done by co-ercion, it will be highly impolitic & injurious to many of our most respectable & efficient citizens & create great dissatisfaction generally. The dispensation given for payments was too short, & at a time when money cannot be fairly realized. The fact is, we do not believe that there is money enough in the nation, to pay the money due to the Bank; consequently the property of the debtors of securities will have to be sacrificed, and the nation probably will lose a great part of the loaned money. Now we leave this subject to your good sense to judge whether all this would not prejudice & embitter the minds of our people against our government.\nIn view of these serious evils and the severe trials which now await us on every hand, _ and, also, considering that it is not indispensably necessary that all","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71182,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/71182","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b406b8bd3f24cc245cf775831a418ca8.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b406b8bd3f24cc245cf775831a418ca8.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b406b8bd3f24cc245cf775831a418ca8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b406b8bd3f24cc245cf775831a418ca8.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T16:04:25+00:00","modified":"2020-03-24T21:51:53+00:00","filename":"b406b8bd3f24cc245cf775831a418ca8.jpg","authentication":"91b0d39f0c6cfb03dfc3f72c36202154","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL07_FL006_00011_o2 copy.jpg","size":754955,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2910,"compression_ratio":0.048043464426626},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["124811+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["124811+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["124811+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b406b8bd3f24cc245cf775831a418ca8.jpg","FileDateTime":1522425844,"FileSize":754955,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2910\"","Height":2910,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2910,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:15:21","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4592},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 12:48:11","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 12:48:11","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":34,"SubSecTimeDigitized":34,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2910,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1057,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1057","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"that all the money loaned out of the National Treasury should be immediately collected.

This policy on the part of the President, to evade a direct reply, is no less astonishing than unjust, because the communication embraced several subjects of new occurrences,which had never been laid before the government.  The Delegation, under these circumstances, were then induced to draw up & lay before the Congress a Memorial, praying that measures may be taken for relief of our sufferings,- but, owing to the multiplicity of businesses before Congress and the shortness of its session, our friends did not succeed in bringing our affairs to a final issue, -

friends\nIt affords me great pleasure to see you here, previous to  the time for the meeting of the next General Council. You have been invited hither not for the object of legislation, but merely for the purpose of a consultation: the Executive does not possess the power of convening the General Council at any other place than at the seat of government established by our constitution; but understanding that a difference in opinion prevails among you, on the subject of holding the next general council at that place it was deemed proper to invite you together previous to the time fixed by the constitution for convening the General Council, that you may have a friendly interchange of sentiment with each other on the subject, and to act with a unison & harmony of feeling on so important an occasion. The constitution under which we have been elected, and which we have sworn to support, prescribes our respective duties & plainly exhibits the path blazed out for us to travel; a wanton departure from the principles therein contained may lead to confusion and the disorganization of our system, and perhaps to our national ruin. In reviewing the present condition of our national affairs and determining the course to be pursued, we should not do it superficially, but the survey should be thoroughly made, that all the bearing may be clearly seen, and evil avoid. _I am happy in the opinion that our country's cause is still gradually advancing by gaining friends and supports abroad and notwithstanding the oppressive acts which our opponents are adopting against us. The continuance of a peaceable, firm and prudent course on our part, cannot fail to crown our efforts in the maintenance of our rights, with sucess. Therefore, let harmony and union be our motto, and I earnestly beseech you to beware of innovations & disorganization.\nYour friend\nJohn Ross.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":71206,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/71206","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/d17c50aa8e751d88f7454dfab55550d8.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/d17c50aa8e751d88f7454dfab55550d8.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/d17c50aa8e751d88f7454dfab55550d8.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/d17c50aa8e751d88f7454dfab55550d8.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T16:04:47+00:00","modified":"2020-03-27T16:58:07+00:00","filename":"d17c50aa8e751d88f7454dfab55550d8.jpg","authentication":"0b54836ff750421d2afdb97e32225fbf","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL07_FL008_00006_o2.jpg","size":710491,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2900,"compression_ratio":0.045369795657727},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["125522+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["125522+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["125522+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"d17c50aa8e751d88f7454dfab55550d8.jpg","FileDateTime":1522425845,"FileSize":710491,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2900\"","Height":2900,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2900,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:15:32","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4080},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 12:55:22","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 12:55:22","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":16,"SubSecTimeDigitized":16,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2900,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1057,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1057","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Messrs John Martin\nJohn Ridge\n&                                                       Head of Coosa C.N.\nWm S.

He said the letter was handed him by Mr Trolt; - likewise informed me that all the prisoners except yourself & Mr Worcester had accepted reprieves.  I let him pass without farther inquiries, not doubting but your letter would give me information of your situation; but, on reading it, found nothing written respecting what took place after your arrivaling Milledsville?.  I tried to wait patiently till yesterday, when I sent John Wane to the Port office, but again found myself disappointed; for there was no letter from my husband.  A multitude of anxious thoughts rushed into my mind.  I concluded you were not able, or not permitted to write.  After some reflection, thought best to come to the conclusion that an indirect route from Milledsville? to this place occasioned the delay.  With this conclusion, I shall write a letter as I get time, & try to wait patiently till I hear from you.  \nOct 5.  Our neighbors have called and given me messages for you.

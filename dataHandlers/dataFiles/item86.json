Printing, education, pioneer life, and religion are all discussed within the letters. Included are the papers of Robert Everett, the pastor of Welsh Congregationalist churches in Oneida County, New York, and publisher of Y Cenhadwr Americanaidd (The American Missionary), a Welsh religious reform magazine that was pro-abolition. Also included are letters and materials of Mary Everett, a graduate of New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, who was also involved in the suffrage movement, John Roberts and Sarah Colgrove Everett, pioneers who moved to Kansas Territory in 1854 and were active in abolitionist activities, and Cynthia Everett, a member of the American Missionary Association who taught freedmen in Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina, following the Civil War. <a href=\"https:\/\/mms.newberry.org\/xml\/xml_files\/Everett.xml#series2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<\/a><br \/><br \/>Cynthia Everett (1839-1876) initially taught school in and around Remsen. In 1870 she went to Norfolk, VA and then Charleston, SC, with the American Missionary Association to teach freedmen. She remained there only a short time before becoming ill and returning to Remsen, but her letters home are filled with descriptions and anecdotes about her students, coworkers, and other details about the experience. Her strong anti-slavery stance is apparent. Many of Cynthia's students and colleagues wrote to her after she left the south; these letters are included in the incoming correspondence.","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":41,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/41","name":"Description","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Cynthia Everett letters, 1853-1876","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":50,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/50","name":"Title","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"A schoolteacher and American missionary who taught freedmen.","element_set":{"id":1,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/1","name":"Dublin Core","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":46,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/46","name":"Relation","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"100","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":55,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/55","name":"Percent Completed","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"100100","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":56,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/56","name":"Weight","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]}

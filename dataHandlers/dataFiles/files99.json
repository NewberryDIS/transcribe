You perhaps remember how many times I made my plans to come but without success. We came the first pleasant day after Tuesday. It was indeed pleasant when - there I have got a pen at last - we started but it began to rain soon after we had passed the big-hill, I think, and continued raining the rest of the way. The road was not very good or very bad. We reached here between two and three o'clock without turning over once, for we had a good driver. Mary? did not take any more cold, but rather left part of what she had on the way. Mother makes her take some bark? before every meal. She seemed quite lonely last evening, but is more cheerful this morning. Sarah is much better than when I saw her before. She had a blister? on her back Saturday night. It raised very well and is coming on nicely, she says she will have another tomorrow night. She is in hopes that they will help her back. Sarah says she wants that letter that you promised her when you were home. Why does it delay? Is uncle Sam unfaithful? Or does the fault rest on someone else? Mother is going to H. unclear today. She is going to try, with Mr. Morris Roberts, to collect something towards paying for unclear church. He will be at the Welsh church in York Mills next Wednesday evening. I write now so that you can go there to see him if you wish.

Hadley tuesday night and hasten to inform you that we have been accepted. I am very glad on your account as well as any own that the answer was favorable or I could not have forgiven myself for neglecting to write so long. I wish very much you could spend next term at home with me, I think we could make home quite comfortable and be well prepared ourselves befor we go next year. South Hadley is no place to do any thing more than keep our clothes in order besides our other duties. I know that you will lose some time by being home, and that you would have to let your french and drawing drop for the present, but I think you and I could find some time every day to read latin. I do not wish to urge you to do any thing that would not be well for you and therefore only mention this and hope you will act your own pleasure. I should like to read Virgil again and think I shall set apart a particular hour each day for that purpose (even if you do not come home), so that I shall be prepared for examination as soon as I go there. I shall try to analyze some flowers during the summer so as not to have quite so much to do next year, if you analyze any be sure to keep the names for it will help you.\nI hope to see you soon and then we can talk over things much better than write them. Sarah is not quite so well as she has been, she has a fever every day. We are expecting Mother home tonight, It seems a long time since she left. We have got along very well but are lonely without her. It is quite unpleasant today and we some fear ma may not be able to come. We are haveing a fine time today as we have very little do. We had fried pork and boiled potatoes to dinner dont you wish you had been here. When I was cooking the pork the fat spattered up on my face and burned it a little in several spots. I tell you this in hopes of having some sympathy from you for Mary says that I make so much fuss when only burned a little that she never knows when to pity me. Did you ever hear such a thing? just as though my face did not hurt any, well I should like to see her feelings just to know if she had any.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":24845,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/24845","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/f8cbdf2cf57bb1d758dabf61dd432707.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/f8cbdf2cf57bb1d758dabf61dd432707.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/f8cbdf2cf57bb1d758dabf61dd432707.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f8cbdf2cf57bb1d758dabf61dd432707.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-05T14:49:28+00:00","modified":"2020-01-16T22:16:46+00:00","filename":"f8cbdf2cf57bb1d758dabf61dd432707.jpg","authentication":"30a5f09ff91df89bf49f58171492f13b","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_04_fl_159_003_02_o2.jpg","size":1132499,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2335,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044908359108573},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["023159"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["023159"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["023159"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f8cbdf2cf57bb1d758dabf61dd432707.jpg","FileDateTime":1507214876,"FileSize":1132499,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2335\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2335,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"14mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:05 11:48:52","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 02:31:59","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 02:31:59","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2288,"ExifImageLength":3527,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":99,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/99","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Sarah says that she is not worse only she has a little cold just now which causes her side to ache.

You probably remember that I promised to send a letter today if I did not go myself, I therfore write for the sake of my word though I have almost nothing to say. I hope you get along nicely and are very good children while I am gone. Remember that in order to be happy you must do right, and if each one tries to be good all will go on well. I trust you are endeavoring to learn a good many vverses for next sabbath, you must not calculate on my saying many as I find no time here to get any.

I suppose you think I mean to send you enough good advice to last till I go home, but do not fear that, I will stop now as I doubt not you will do as well as you can, just as much as though I gave you a hundred directions.__ I had a very pleasant ride in the stage monday, arrived here about 3 1\/2 o'clock. Robert was very much surprised to see me as you may well think, but he seemed glad. I told him he must thank Mary for my visit, and I suppose he is willing to do it. I found he was not nearly ady to have the carpet sewed, we probably shall do it tomorrow evening. I went up to Whitestown monday evening to see sister Elizabeth, but met cousin Thomas by the seminary gate and he thought I ought to go over to see Mary. He had just been seding cousin Elizabeth to the sea.

Love to all in haste from Jennie.\nDear Parents: I have been quite a spend-thrift this vacation and have used my part of your new year's gift. If convenient I should like to have a little more sent by Mary. It will be time at the first of the term for us to pay the rest of our tuition and she will need to bring 60$ (30$ for each). I forgot to write about this sooner as we were requested to have it ready the first of the term. You had better send it with Mary as it will be soon enough then. I am sorry to hear that you have all been sick. Wish I could have been with you. I must not write but a few very lines as it is most too late for the mail. I am quite well. Sarah thinks she will be happy to go to our home. She is an excellent sewer and I think if you could have Mary Jones to help about the house you had better have her do your sewing. You know there is a great deal of that to do and I do not know as she would wish to stay long. She is well prepared to teach and has been more accustomed to doing that.

But adieu, much love to you both and to Mr. E's family -\nSister Jennie Everett.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":24914,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/24914","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/933bee22ac1fd7d2d5914806d43eeab5.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/933bee22ac1fd7d2d5914806d43eeab5.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/933bee22ac1fd7d2d5914806d43eeab5.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/933bee22ac1fd7d2d5914806d43eeab5.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-05T14:52:28+00:00","modified":"2020-01-16T22:16:46+00:00","filename":"933bee22ac1fd7d2d5914806d43eeab5.jpg","authentication":"5221a82a582673165398d24f6249f277","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_04_fl_159_025_01_o2.jpg","size":1237345,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2892,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.039615830387788},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["023813+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["023813+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["023813+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"933bee22ac1fd7d2d5914806d43eeab5.jpg","FileDateTime":1507214879,"FileSize":1237345,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2892\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2892,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"13mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:05 11:50:42","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 02:38:13","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 02:38:13","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTime":0,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"SubSecTimeDigitized":0,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2239,"ExifImageLength":2787,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":99,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/99","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1860's\nRemsen, August 3rd?\nDear Sister:\nNot a word have we heard from you since last Thursday: What can be the matter?

Mother told you that Aunt Sarah was here very sick and quite deranged. She still continues very long.

That was Friday, Saturday she walked backward and forwards in the shade of the house, all morning and staid a great part of the afternoon in the office. Sunday she walked all day, and by night was hardly able to put one foot before the other. Monday she could not leave her bed and seemed in great trouble. she was much the same Tuesday.

You saw, did you not, in the last Cenhadwr, the account of the Quarterly Meeting in unclear and also R. Gwesyn Jones' he was afraid that he might frighten father, or trouble him I ought to say, - but Sunday night after meeting, talking it over with the friends it was decided best for him not to go, as Wm. Thomas was going as the friend of H. R. J. and he said he would tell the lawyer about father - how long he had been settled here, his high standing and integrity, &c, and that it would injure H. R.

This we followed the whole day seeing occasionally a deer bound across until about an hour before sundown when we came upon numerous tracks which Peshwego said were the tracks of the remainder of our party which had bone on before and that we were close to the camp.\nPresently the sound of an axe was heard, and soon, turning a ben of the creek we came upon the little shanty and our Indian friends engaged in making it habitable.  The stages which Peshwego had ... the winter before were still standing and the skulls he kept of deer & bears showed that he had been busy with his rifle.  The shanty itself was a unique affair, 10 ft long by 6 made with a sloping roof and about 5 ft high, much resembling (with the difference that it was built of rough logs & thatched with bark) the pigsties met with in the country.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":57728,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/57728","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c4decf04f414f528262e32b0c77dab58.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/c4decf04f414f528262e32b0c77dab58.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/c4decf04f414f528262e32b0c77dab58.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c4decf04f414f528262e32b0c77dab58.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-13T20:44:00+00:00","modified":"2019-11-25T17:12:48+00:00","filename":"c4decf04f414f528262e32b0c77dab58.jpg","authentication":"7e5afd045ea12d088607171a6d8e3e2a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"GR_3615_0033_o2 copy.jpg","size":470714,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2278,"compression_ratio":0.038265697655513},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"c4decf04f414f528262e32b0c77dab58.jpg","FileDateTime":1520973792,"FileSize":470714,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2278\"","Height":2278,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2278,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:13 13:02:10","Exif_IFD_Pointer":236},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":386,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6162},"EXIF":{"ExifVersion":221,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2278}}}},"item":{"id":922,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/922","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"It was entered by a square hole of about 3 ft ... -- in one of the gable ends and inside, the floor was laid with bark on each side the fire, which ran the entire length of the hut -- the whole top of the roof was left open to allow the escape of the smoke, as were also the interstices of the logs, the lower ones alone being filled up with moss.

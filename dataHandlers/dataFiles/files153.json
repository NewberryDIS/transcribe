Sarah\nDear [[Father?], - I have but few minutes to write. I am very anxious to give this place a fair trial before I can think of leaving it. I feel a great deal discouraged just now about means. It will cost me $35 at least to fix this house so we can live in it - twice as much as I expected when we began. We have raised the house as to have a story and a half and put on a new roof. The old shingles we use for a floor upstairs. These shingles are oak 3 feet long, 1\/2 inch thick. Our lower floor is made of puncheons. These puncheons are made out of a tree, sawed about 5 feet long, and then split into thick slabs, and hewed down with a unclear. First summer we had no door or window. Now we will have a door made out of the oak? shingles. Put? that two split sticks, clapboard fashion, hung perhaps on wood? hinges. Like your garden gate. That's the way they do here. Today I have almost made a bargain buying unclear nails. 1200 at $1.50 a hundred. This will take a good share of the money you have let me have, and I shall then be in debt for a good share of the improvement on my house. I think I shall get the nails. unclear from half a dollar to a dollar cheaper than they are selling nails here, and I must have them, and do not see how - I can split the. We are expecting some assistance from Father Lesleyrove? this spring. I hope we can get help enough to get through the summer. I am afraid of burdening you too much, but if you can borrow a little for me, I think I could return it without doubt in a few years and pay the interest as it comes due. I am afraid you will think I am asking a great deal, particularly as you are so anxious we shall return. It would be a very grievous and heavy discouragement to have to go back now. We can get along here now with a great deal less that we can start with any where else. We are not alarmed on account of the Missourians. The cruel outrages you read of in the papers take place generally (excepting the Lawrence difficulties) near slaveholding or proslavery settlement. These are mainly north of the Kansas river. The community here are overwhelmingly freestate. The Congress? commission it is hoped will do us good, and lead to good for us. O that the free unclear would for once write, and raise the banner of liberty for Kansas!

It did me a great deal of good to get a letter from Robert.

Hope you will not be worried about us, I feel no apprehension here, sleep as soundly at night as if no one wished or intended to cut my throat. \nS.M.C.E","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":35602,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/35602","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/e044aeb9d256d8ef7b6a61144256be08.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/e044aeb9d256d8ef7b6a61144256be08.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/e044aeb9d256d8ef7b6a61144256be08.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/e044aeb9d256d8ef7b6a61144256be08.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T19:32:40+00:00","modified":"2020-04-08T13:58:19+00:00","filename":"e044aeb9d256d8ef7b6a61144256be08.jpg","authentication":"dcd82f0741d09ea3b5970d4848f41ee7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_02_fl_111_006_01_o2.jpg","size":1051897,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2302,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.042310108762107},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["040801"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["040801"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["040801"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"e044aeb9d256d8ef7b6a61144256be08.jpg","FileDateTime":1507750278,"FileSize":1051897,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2302\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2302,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"9mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:03:03 15:24:18","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:02 04:08:01","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:02 04:08:01","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1488,"ExifImageLength":2327,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":153,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/153","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Osawatomie April 8, 1866\nDear Cynthia,\nI received your very welcome letter last Thursday a week and a day after it was dated.

I was truly glad to get a few lines from you again.  I send you a specimen in this of the red-legged locust of which I have written before.  This is the female.  The two points which project behind it uses to bore holes in the ground to deposit eggs.  They seem to choose the hardest spots to lay their eggs, like places where cattle have tramped near farm houses.  Their eggs are still alive.  I have heard this morning of a neighbor who has found some of the eggs and brought them into the house and laid them in a warm place, and he says in a very short time they hatch out and go to jumping.  The weather in the spring here is quite changeable.  Our hope is that there may come some warm weather in the spring to  hatch\n\nHow will the Cen. turn out this year. They are having hard times in the iron works which must affect it some Does Glycine help your keaniny?

That she was always so cheerful and hopeful, so ready to help and devoted as a daughter and sister.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":35695,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/35695","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/709703a513d1cda469ae690882ee6327.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/709703a513d1cda469ae690882ee6327.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/709703a513d1cda469ae690882ee6327.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/709703a513d1cda469ae690882ee6327.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-11T19:37:07+00:00","modified":"2020-05-01T21:22:35+00:00","filename":"709703a513d1cda469ae690882ee6327.jpg","authentication":"1cc20a452628016dcb4216091d48ebc3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_02_fl_112_030_02_o2.jpg","size":820212,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2336,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.032510939878234},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["041911"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["041911"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160302"],"TimeCreated":["041911"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"709703a513d1cda469ae690882ee6327.jpg","FileDateTime":1507750281,"FileSize":820212,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2336\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2336,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"9mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:03:03 15:27:34","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:02 04:19:11","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:02 04:19:11","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":5,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1541,"ExifImageLength":2374,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":153,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/153","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"her example so beneficent and unclear.

I don't want any more milk after the cow has had it!\" That Evening their milk was not touched. Freddie said he did not want any milk after the cow had had it.

The mother then Explained that the milk did not come to them second hand - that the cow ate the grass, and that by the wonderful process of life such as the good God ordered the grass was changed into milk. This satisfied Willie, but Freddie still turned up his nose at milk. After supper Willie took his brother aside into the corner. \"It's all right. Freddie,\" said he. \"The cow eats grass, and that's what makes the milk. Now if the cow didn't -Eat the grass you would have to, you see. That's what the cow is for.\" This satisfied the young philosopher, and he had no hesitation after that about drinking his milk. You are learning to make your letters better.

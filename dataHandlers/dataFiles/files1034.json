Adjt. Gen'l Dept. of Texas\nSir:\n\n        I have the honor to make the following statement in reply to the questions asked by the Asst. Adjt. General, Dept. of Texas.\n\n1st.   I visited McClellan Creek twice in the year 1871. Water was found standing in large pools, but quite deep and sweet, the water near the mouth of this stream runs in the sand. In 1874 the stream was very much swollen on account of heavy rains. I think water can be found in the stream all the year round, but I don't think it will be running unless an unusually wet season. The water near the mouth of McClellan Creek is salty and brackish and in the year 1871 we were compelled to dig for water  for both men and animals of the Command a few miles below the mouth of McClellan Creek in the North Fork. The Sweetwater has good water about four miles from the mouth. I cannot say as to the permanency of the water in this stream as I was never on this stream about the longitude of the mouth of McClellan Creek except in a wet season but I am of the opinion that water can be had about 15 miles below the longitude referred to at all times. The North Fork never has running water except in wet seasons and as a general thing it is salty and brackish.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69240,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69240","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7b600f24be295e0f8f6b360f7920effc.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7b600f24be295e0f8f6b360f7920effc.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7b600f24be295e0f8f6b360f7920effc.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7b600f24be295e0f8f6b360f7920effc.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:22:03+00:00","modified":"2020-01-29T21:53:32+00:00","filename":"7b600f24be295e0f8f6b360f7920effc.jpg","authentication":"7100d6352f493696b1dd4dbef086a8ef","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":16,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00080_o2 copy.jpg","size":693385,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2854,"compression_ratio":0.044991110592022},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["010251+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["010251+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["010251+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7b600f24be295e0f8f6b360f7920effc.jpg","FileDateTime":1522340515,"FileSize":693385,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2854\"","Height":2854,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2854,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 10:04:16","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4621},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:22 01:02:51","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:22 01:02:51","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":44,"SubSecTimeDigitized":44,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2854,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1034,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1034","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"2nd.   The timber on the above mentioned streams is Cottonwood, some little Elm and Hackberry on McClellan Creek , the most timber is to be found on McClellan Creek and the North Fork above McClellan Creek.\n3rd.    McClellan Creek cannot be depended on for grass, as for instance in 1871 we found several large bottoms of grass , in 1874 none was to be found whatever except on the hillsides or divides. The North Fork has grasses only in patches of a few acres and generally of a very poor quality. The Sweetwater has some very fine bottoms and more abundance of grass than either of the other two streams.\n4th.    I do not think that building stone can be had in the vicinity of either stream, although there is appearances of stone but in my opinion it is too soft to be quarried I think that soil can be had on either McClellan Creek or Sweetwater for making adobes. \n5th.    As a general thing the country is very much broken, the soil sandy and covered with shin oak, some parts of it good divides can be found with very short grass. In my opinion the country along the Sweetwater is considered as the best with the exception of timber.\n6th.    Not being versed in the science of Geology I cannot answer this question. \n7th.    I think fuel may be obtained in the vicinity of either for several years but it may necessitate it being hauled several miles. I do not think that  timber for building purposes can be had in the vicinity of either.\n8th.    Hay may be obtained on the Sweetwater but on the other two streams it cannot be had.\n9th.    Yes there is large bottoms on all these streams the largest are on the Sweetwater but few of them have timber they have standing water in them in wet seasons I do not think that they overflow, but in my opinion they are unhealthy and productive of  chills and fever.\nVery Respectfully\nYour obdt. servant\nRobert G.

about Satanta and other Indians who have committed murder and stolen animals during the last ten years.\nDept. of Justice,\nWashington, June 1873.\nTo the President,\n\n       Sir,\n               I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt from you of several papers relative to the Modoc Indians now in the custody of the U.S. Army with a request for my opinion as to the authority to try certain of the prisoners by a Military Tribunal. The main facts out of which the question arises are these:\n\n  In 1864 the United States made a treaty with these Indians by the terms of which they were to go and remain upon a reservation in the State of Oregon. Late last fall, the Indians being away from their reservation, a military detachment was sent to procure their return. Finding them unwilling to go peacefully, the Officer indicated his determination to use compulsion in consequence of which a conflict ensued between the U.S. troops and the Indians.\n Soon after several peacable citizens and their families in the vicinity were murdered by Indians of this band. They then entrenched themselves in the lava beds in the neighborhood, fighting ensued and one or more severe battles in which persons on both sides were wounded or killed , and the U.S. troops repulsed.\n  Pending hostilities, negotiations were opened for peace and on the 15th of April last General Canby, Rev. Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Meacham at a point between the opposing forces, and in pursuance of a mutual agreement to that end, met Captain Jack the leader of the Indians, with some of the Chief Warriors, to discuss the term of a treaty, and while so engaged, General Canby and Mr. Thomas were treacherously assassinated and Mr. Meacham severely wounded by the Indians present upon that occasion. Battles followed and Captain Jack and all or most of his tribe have been captured and are now in the hands of the military authorities.\n  General Sherman, in a communication to the Secretary of War dated the 3rd, instant recommends that such of the Indians as have violated military law, be tried by a military tribunal.\n  This recommendation is approved by the Secretary of War. Instructions were prepared in 1868 by Frances Lieber, L.L.D., revised by a Board of Officers, of which General E. A. Hitchcock was president, and after approval by the President of the United States,","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69244,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69244","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/78b93153a3c50f31b17b069503e125e1.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/78b93153a3c50f31b17b069503e125e1.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/78b93153a3c50f31b17b069503e125e1.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/78b93153a3c50f31b17b069503e125e1.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:22:06+00:00","modified":"2020-01-29T21:53:33+00:00","filename":"78b93153a3c50f31b17b069503e125e1.jpg","authentication":"d6e4d75c8493cd3e0e5d2fdd83f9d1ab","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":20,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00082_o2 copy.jpg","size":779428,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2871,"compression_ratio":0.050274649431738},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["010322+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["010322+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["010322+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"78b93153a3c50f31b17b069503e125e1.jpg","FileDateTime":1522340515,"FileSize":779428,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2871\"","Height":2871,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2871,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 10:04:18","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5128},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:22 01:03:22","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:22 01:03:22","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":66,"SubSecTimeDigitized":66,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2871,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1034,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1034","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"were published for the Government of the Armies of the U.S. in the field. Section 13 of the \"instructions\" is as follows:\n\n    \"Military jurisdiction is of two kinds - \n\nfirst, that which is conferred and defined by the statute,\nsecond, that which is derived from the common law of war.\n\n     Military offences under the statute law must be tried in the manner therein directed but military offences which do not come within the statute must be tried and punished under the common law of war.\"\n     The character of the Courts which exercise these jurisdictions depends upon the local laws of each particular country. In the Armies of the United States the first is exercised by Court Martial while cases which do not come within the rules and articles of war or the jurisdiction conferred by statute on Courts Martial are tried by Military Commissions.\n     All the authorities which I have been able to examine upon this subject, harmonize with these instructions. According to the laws of war, there is nothing more sacred than a flag of truce dispatched in good faith, and there can be no greater act of perfidy and treachery than the assassination of its bearers, after they have been acknowledged and received by those, to whom they are sent. No statute of the United States makes this act a crime, and therefore it is not punishable under the \"rules and articles of war\" and if punishable at all, must be through a power derived from the usages of war. Kindred to the act in question in bad faith, is the breaking of his parole by a paroled prisoner.\n     While the United States were at war with Mexico, several officers of the Mexican Army were tried by a Military Commission composed of officers of the United States army and convicted and sentenced to be shot and executed for breaking their paroles. Numerous trials of a similar nature took place during the war of the Rebellion but there are no statutory provisions whatever upon the subject and the whole power of the military authorities in such cases is derived from the usages of\n\nwar. \n\n     On the 23rd of August 1865 a Military Commission duly appointed, assembled in the city of Washington for the trial of Henry Wirtz, who pleaded among other things that the Military Commission had no jurisdiction over either his person or over the subject matter of the charges and specifications, being a tribunal unauthorized by either statute, military law, or well established usage.\n     But this plea was overruled and he was convicted upon several charges, one of which was murder in violation of the laws and customs of war and after sentence he was hung for his crimes.\n     All the proceedings in this case derived their authority and validity from the common law of

Congress may define and punish offences against the laws, but in default of Congress defining those laws and prescribing a punishment for their infraction, and the mode of proceeding to ascertain whether an offence has been committed, and what punishment is to be inflicted - the Army must be governed by the laws and usages of war as understood and practiced by the civilized Nations of the world.\"\n   Again - \"If the prisoner be a regular unoffending soldier of the opposite party to the war, he should be treated with all the courtesy and kindness consistent with his safe custody. If he has offended against the laws of war, he should have trial and punishment as the laws of war require.\n   A spy, though a prisoner of war, may be tried, condemned and executed by a military tribunal without a breach of the constitution.\n   A Bushwacker, a Jayhawker, a bandit, a war rebel, an assassin - being public enemies - may be tried, condemned and executed as offenders against the laws of war.\" \n   The laws of Nations, which is the result of the experience and wisdom of ages has decided that Jayhawkers, bandits etc. are offenders against the laws of Nature & War, and as such amenable to the military.\n   Our Constitution has made these laws a part of the laws of the land ( see also Vattel 359, Wheaton's International Law 416, Woolsey's Int.

[stamp]\nin the field.\n\n         Manifestly these rules are, to a great extent, if not altogether correct, for it cannot be pretended that an United States soldier is guilty of murder if he kills a public enemy in battle, which would be the care if the municipal laws was in force, and application to an act committed under such circumstances.  All the laws and customs of civilized warfare may not be applicable to an armed conflict with Indian tribes upon our Western frontier, but the circumstances attending the assassination of General [strike] Canby and Thomas, are such as to make their murder as much a violation of the laws of savage as of civilized warfare, and the Indians concerned in it fully understood the baseness and treachery of their act.\n         It is difficult to define exactly the relations of the Indian tribes to the United States, but as they have been recognized as independent communities for treaty making purposes, and as they frequently carry on organized and protracted wars, they may properly, as it seems to me, be held subject to those rules of warfare which make a negociation for peace after hostilities possible, and which make perfidy like that in question, punishable by military authority.\n         Doubtless the war with the Modocs is practically ended, unless some of them should escape and renew hostilities; but it is the right of the United States, as there is no agreement for peace, to determine for themselves, whether or not anything ought to be done for the protection of the country, or the punishment of crimes, growing out of the war.\n         Section 59. of said Instructions is as follows: -\n\n\"A prisoner of war remains answerable for his crimes committed against the captor's army or people, committed before he was captured and for which he has not been punished by his own authorities.\"\n\n         The conclusion therefore is, that a Military Commission may be appointed to try such of the Modoc Indians now in custody as are charged with offences against the recognized laws of war, and that if, upon such trial, any are found guilty, they may be subjected to such punishment as those laws require or justify.\n                                                                            (Sgd) George H.

We coincide with you that the opinion of the Department of Justice of June Eighteen seventy three seems to give full jurisdiction to such Commission over the case named in your telegram.

Nov, 14, 1874. \nMy dear Mr. Delano, \nI am in receipt of your letter of Nov. 10th?. Latanta? has been turned over to the Governor of Texas, but only as I suppose - to serve out his unexpired term in the Penitentiary of Texas. His sentence was commuted, I believe to imprisonment for life and I have no idea that he will be Executed, and if any further information can be elicited favorable to him, his punishment may be still further mitigated. \nI think it would be a good thing to ease down on the parties hostile at present and during the summer, and make the scope of the Military Commission embrace but a few cases; and if you and the Secretary of War will only consent to let me send such as I would like to select for imprisonment or surveillance, to some of the Forts on the seacoast, I am sure we can break the war spirit of the tribes Effectually in the way and without shocking any philanthropy sentiment in the country. There would be no objection to let the immediate family of such as were selected, go along. \nIt is very necessary, in fact absolute necessary, and Even demanded by the Indians who remained at peace, that those who went out this summer shall be punished.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69249,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69249","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/1d19cf22aeb6add7be256675f27a1b6c.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/1d19cf22aeb6add7be256675f27a1b6c.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/1d19cf22aeb6add7be256675f27a1b6c.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1d19cf22aeb6add7be256675f27a1b6c.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:22:11+00:00","modified":"2020-03-03T18:18:42+00:00","filename":"1d19cf22aeb6add7be256675f27a1b6c.jpg","authentication":"bacac13a613305361bbf9b705010e44e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":25,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00084_o2.jpg","size":673085,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG

It has never been urged by anyone, I believe, that Satanta had any claim to mitigation of the punishment awarded him, or was justly entitled to mercy of any kins, and his temporary release from the Penitentiary, was granted not from consideration to him [3 word underline], but as a kind of bribe to his tribe to cease depredating in Texas, and upon the pledge of the tribe that it would do so.\nHowever that [strike 2 words] In case it did not however Satanta was to be returned to the Penitentiary or \"others equal to him\".  The latter clause of this condition is of course worthless, as even Indians - unfortunately sometimes -  cannot be picked up and sent to the Penitentiary without a trial, and Indians convicted of raiding into Texas would hardly escape with the Penitentiary.   The question as to whether Satanta himself became hostile again or not, was not considered, and did not enter at all into the condition of his release.  There is no question as to Kiowas having raided in Texas since his release - and there is no question as to the course of Satanta, if the Indians had had a show of success.

Dec.3. 1874\n\nDear General Augur, \n\n           I enclose you the orders in reference to Indian prisoners and Indian ponies. I have held them back thinking that some more Indians would come in, but think it best to not wait any longer, unless you have some good reason to still delay.\n                                                            You will see that there is full authority for the Military Commission and if some of the Indians can be hung it will have a salutary Effect.  I will be ready to designate the place of confinement on the seaboard by the time you have selected the prisoners to be confined.  I presume the ponies are very poor, but as the main object is to deprive the Indians of them, the matter of what they will bring is of small consequence.  \n                                                            The same instructions as these will be sent to Gen'l. Pope for the Cheyennes. They must be dealt with alike.                \n                                                                                                                                                  Yours truly,\n                 Official                                                                                                                          (Sgd) J.H.

Buell to put the remainder of his Column in march for Sill tomorrow.  I send with him his train, so that if there is no need for him about Sill, there will be no harm done.  He can get his command together and make a start from Sill in plenty of time to leave Beaver Creek on the 18th.\n            It is simply that he might be needed and that his command has the time to spare.  Please give the subject of Forage, Rations and other Supplies for Griffin attention, as it appears to be that there is now much danger of trouble about Forage at this place.  I have sent Lieut. Irvin to Richardson, and if he thought necessary to Weatherford and Dallas to hurry the Contractors, who from what I can learn are moving very leisurely when there is the utmost importance that they should hurry.

If this ve so, the supplies for such a Camp can be loaded at unknown and taken directly to it, and there will be no necessity for purchasing additional mules.

Nothing further from Miles or Price:\n(Sgt) C.C. Augur\nBrigr Gen'l.\nHdqrs. D. T. Fort Still, Sept. 10. 1874.\nMil. Div.\nDear General Sheridan,\n\n    I received this morning your letter of the 2nd. and your dispatch of the 5th inst. I have not deemed it advisable to take any action in the case of Col. Davidson. He appears to be doing well and to be animated with a strong desire to do whatever is possible. The incompleteness of the affair at the Washita Agency is due probably to the unexpected attacks of what were considered friendly Indians and an uncertainty as to how far the defections had Extended. The attitude of the Washitas, Caddos and in fact all the quasi friendly bands at that Agency, was very wavering at that time. They were all mingled together with those who fired upon the troops, and the troops could not in many instances return the fire upon them unless they fired into the families, who were Endeavoring to get out of the way. Davidson also appears to have been uncertain how far he would be sustained in his action and anticipated, he tells me, that the Indian Dept. would complain of him, one object of his telegram, to Commissioner, he says, was to get the first hearing.\n    Although incomplete, the affair has had a good Effect, and it had better be regarded, I think, as a success.\n    It is understood by the Indians, by the Agent and by the Special Commissioner, whom I met here, Mr. Smith, that all Indians coming in are to be disarmed and to be subjected to such other conditions as the Government may impose. I think there a troops enough available here and at the Washita, to carry this out. If not, I can send for either Davidson's or Buell's Column.\n    I had intended to start for home on Tuesday next after the departure of Buell's column and after fitting myself out to return immediately to this point, to remain. But I think now I had better not leave at all. I shall send also down on Monday to San Antonio for such things as I need -- I have nothing with me -- just my travelling rig -- and take up my residence here for the present and until this matter is settled. After leaving what I can about the country, I have determined to locate Buell's Camp from which he shall operate, in Wanderer's Creek. This Creek is a small southern tributary of the Red and about 70 miles South of West from Fort Sill. You will readily find it on Davidson's map. I have been able to Effect an arrangement with the Trader here, by which he will deliver freight at that point for a Dollar a hundred. I can keep that place supplied","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69267,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69267","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/5f7fc4adccf3b056249f5dc8dc3001ea.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/5f7fc4adccf3b056249f5dc8dc3001ea.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/5f7fc4adccf3b056249f5dc8dc3001ea.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/5f7fc4adccf3b056249f5dc8dc3001ea.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:22:28+00:00","modified":"2020-04-08T17:51:36+00:00","filename":"5f7fc4adccf3b056249f5dc8dc3001ea.jpg","authentication":"86525503e03662c50b1d785828342ade","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":43,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00093_o2.jpg","size":749386,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2895,"compression_ratio":0.047936160685729},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["010907+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["010907+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["010907+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"5f7fc4adccf3b056249f5dc8dc3001ea.jpg","FileDateTime":1522340516,"FileSize":749386,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2895\"","Height":2895,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2895,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 10:04:28","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4490},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:22 01:09:07","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:22 01:09:07","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":61,"SubSecTimeDigitized":61,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2895,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1034,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1034","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"I think for both columns, Buell can then use his wagons for operating in the field.

I infer from what you say, that Miles and Price are not to come here at all unless by accident. Everyone is anxious to make this campaign a success and Every Officer and Everyone I think will strive to make it so. I enclose copy of a letter this day received from Col. Neill. It is, you will observe, but an amplification of the one sent you by last mail. No forage trains have yet reached here. Davidson's command was only provided with sufficient forage by making details there from the gather cordn and run the shelling machine. Unfortunately this machine was broken this afternoon and it is believe to be irreparable here by any man.

Qrs.D.T. Fort. Sill. i.T.Sept, 17 1874\nMo.Mil.Div. Dear General Sheridan,\nI enclose copies of a number of letters received from Mackenzie. Although of different dates, they were all received here the same day. You will see from them, that he has had the same trouble as ourselves in getting forage to load his train. I have sent for Holabird to go to Dallas and other points and to see exactly what we can depend upon from our contractors. Meanwhile I will ask you to send five thousand bushels more corn to Denison or Dallas for Fort. Griffin. Since the secretary broke up the Dallas arrangement, I am entirely in the dark about matters there. The Dr.Mr who ships it, should notify Hoabird, that he may notify the contractor.. Buelle's train, I am sorry to say, is still detained south of Red river. There seems to have been a very great and a very unexpected rise in that stream. I sent the train there, in order to hasten matters, as it did in the case of Davidson's command, but owing to the high water, it will cause delay instead; it cannot be helped. Buelle is very impatient as well as myself, I really do not think, however, that this delay will be in the least detrimental, as the Indians are effected by the other other columns, they will fall back probably upon the Main road and Buell will be in good time to meet them. Meanwhile the presence of his command here has been beneficial .\nYours very truly,\n(Sgd) C.C.Augur, Brig. Genl, Commdg\nChief Dr.Mr.D.T.  \"Telegram\"\nColonel Holabird, Dept. Hdqrs, San Antonio, TX               Fort Sill, Sept. 20,1874\nI shall not probably go to Chicago, Arla has lettres for you telling both Colie and yourself what I wish done. You may do your work possibly without coming here and in time to let you meet Mrs.Holabird in Chicago. The only transportation at Dallas is what waits to bring up Colie and yourself if you come. The mules to be purchased for Griffin should be sent here as soon as possible in teams with wagons. Is not Dallas a good place to purchase mules the wagons and harness could be sent there. You may meet Arlo on the road and get your letter. Colie must wait until he arrives here.\n(sgd) .C.C. Augur, Brig.

You will remember what importance was attached to the point of having this corn at Griffin on the fifth of Septbr. Was Mr.Graham informed of this? Was Capt. Strang informed? If so, there has been great indifference manifested apparently by one or both of them. Please ascertain and report all the facts in the case. I will again call your attention to the point of changing our working points on the Railraod from Denison to Dallas. I wish to have your report on this subject; so soon as you can make it, with all the facts before you. Bear in mind that for all stores coming from New Orleans and San Antonio that Dassas must be our stopping point and if Denison is kept up we must have agents or Dr.Mrs., one for each point. Has Strong given any statement or opinion to the M.K.& T road on the subject?If so what was it? I do not think it will be necessary for you to come here, if you can see Mcthaim? and other contractors, and arrange for the speedy transportation of all supplies. We must have no more such delays as we had met here and at Griffin. If you meet Mrs. Holabird in Chicago on the 8th , you will be in time to come down with General Sheridan. I shall meet him at [Cadda?} and you had better remain there until I see you. What does Strong pay for Govt. freight from St.Louis to Denison?

He released him from arrest on a promise of reform, to enable him to go on the Expedition with him, and he (B) took the column over from Clark to McKavett, where it arrived the same day with us.

This is the history of his leave. Bankhead's influence on the young officers is bad. He must soon reform or he must leave the service - this is certain.

upon our frontiers from that country as a base.\n\n    From information contained in the papers, I have the honor to enclose you, it will be seen they have already carried this purpose into execution and, after killing our citizens and carrying away their children, have taken refuge in Mexico.\n    You are aware, General, of the causes of anxiety heretofore existing between our Countries growing out of the depredations upon our frontiers by our Indian refugees in Mexico, and of the efforts made by my Government, to end them by inducing the Indians to return and settle upon their reservations.\n    A number of Pottawatomies did return last year and Commissioners are now at work to induce the Kickapoos to return.  It is to be hoped they will be successful.  A now comes this new complication of a portion of the Commanches driven from this country for their crimes, attempting to avail themselves of a  Mexico as a refuge from further pursuit and as a safe retreat from which to commit further depredations.\n    I cannot believe, General, that the Mexican Government will permit this source of irritation to continue, or that it will delay taking efficient measures to either immediately and definitely stop these depredations, or to compel these Indians to return to their own Country.\n    I address you, General, as the officer Commanding on the Rio Grande frontier, and as, I presume, the person to take action in such matters.  I especially request, that the young children whose capture is referred to and who have been seen at Remolino, may be taken charge of and returned to the Commanding Officer at Fort Duncan, at Eagle Pass.\n     I regret exceedingly my necessary absence from San Antonio at the time of your visit to Piedras Negras.

I do not know iif you are aware of the arrangements already made for changing the 4th and 10th cavalry.\n                   The 4th is to go to Till the new post on or near  Mclelellan Creek and to Richardson.  The tenth to Concho, Mcthavett, Griffin, Davis and Stochton, and the Companies of the ninth, more coming in from the Indian country to take the place of the fourth at Clark and Duncan.   Giving to the unprecedented rains of this winter, the troops out cannot get in as soon as anticipated, and in consequence, the movements for exchange of Posts and for the establishment of the new Post may not commence as soon as contemplated--the first of March.  But they will commence so soon as the condition of the wades will warrant unless I receive orders to the contrary.  The movements referred to were determined upon under the direction of Lieut. General Sheridan.  A number of Comanches have recently gone to Mexico and will Endevor, I believe, to arrange for a residence there--finding it no longer safe on this side.  If they do we shay have a recurrence of raids from that side.  In a recent letter to General {F]uero the Mexican Commandandante at that frontier, I requested his interference to prevent this.  I am unable to course to say how far he may be willing or able to do anything.\n                   What few Comanches and Kiowas are now absent from Lill, are on the Pecos, at points from its mouth to the Guadelupe Mountains and I propose in the spring to start a column from Fort Clark","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69279,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69279","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/13af15cda51dcb7f57c37048476a52a0.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/13af15cda51dcb7f57c37048476a52a0.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/13af15cda51dcb7f57c37048476a52a0.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/13af15cda51dcb7f57c37048476a52a0.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:22:39+00:00","modified":"2020-04-15T00:18:00+00:00","filename":"13af15cda51dcb7f57c37048476a52a0.jpg","authentication":"a54030f1184069fbef12eec63957800a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":55,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX02_00099_o2.jpg","size":691785,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2902,"compression_ratio":0.044144842637262},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["011045+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["011045+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["011045+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"13af15cda51dcb7f57c37048476a52a0.jpg","FileDateTime":1522340516,"FileSize":691785,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2902\"","Height":2902,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2902,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 10:04:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3979},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:22 01:10:45","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:22 01:10:45","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":79,"SubSecTimeDigitized":79,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2902,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1034,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1034","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"to clean that entire country. A summer camp will also be kept up at or near Mackinzie's supply camp. These operations together with the new Post at McClellan's creek it is believed will force all absent Indians to return to their agencies or flee into Mexico, and also effectively control those now in.\nI hope to meet General Feuro? in February and if he will operate on his side in concert with the column up the Pecos, we can soon clear that frontier. If such concert cannot be arranged the dissatisfied Indians will all eventually find refuge in Mexico, and another pursuit of them into that country will, I fear be necessary to awaken the Mexican government to the necessity of taking action in the case. What I hear of General Fuero is highly favorable and induces a belief that a satisfactory concert of action can be arranged with him.\nThe one great difficulty, I fear, is that the people of Mexico on the frontier are reported as favorable to the residence of the Indians among them, as they find arising therefrom a profitable traffic in the blunder brought in by these Indians from their raids into our country.

I believe myself to have been the first to suggest last fall a change of the 10th Cavalry from Fort Sill and the sending the 4th Cavalry there in its place and I have that in my mind there was no question of Colonel Grierson in the case. His Regiment has occupied that Post since it was Established - six years - longer I believe thanof any other Cavalry Regiment in service has occupied a Post continuously. \nThe mere change of stations of the Regiment is not a righful  cause of complaint therefor, neither is it a hurtful change, as the Posts it will occupy are not unpleasant ones, and afford good opportunities for legitimate work. \nIn conversation about this change, I suggested to Gen\u2019l Sheridan that I thought it bad policy to Keep all the Colored troops in the Army in one Department and mentioned that New Mexico would be a good place for a colored Regiment and if the 10th went there, Grierson would have Command of a District for which I thought him well qualified. \nMy reasons for thinking a change of troops at Fort Sill desirable were, as I have stated already, Entirely independent of any question concerning Col Grierson. I only regret that his Regiment did not go to New Mexico - not that I am not and have not been perfectly satisfied both with Col. Grierson and with his Refiment, but for the reason stated to the Lieut, General Sheridan that I think it a mistake to have all the Colored troops in one Department, and the 10th was in a position to make a change to New Mexico both convenient and useful and would give Col. Grierson Command of a District. \nI know Col. Grierson very well and have the Kindest feelings for him, and he need have no apprehensions of any injustice from me. I have no favorites. \nPersonally I should prefer to 10th to the 8th as I do not know well a single Officer in the latter Regiment, while I know well and have a great regard for nearly all in the 10th, which during the past summer has done most Excellent service.\n\nThe troops coming in from their summer Camps have had very severe weather and have suffered a great deal. We have lost too, a great many horses, owing to the impossibility of getting to them a proper supply of forage. But they are all in now. \n\nThe baggage of the 4th Cavalry has started probably before this time.

Senor, Your letter to me of September 23, 1874 was received here during my absence, and failed to receive at the time the attention it deserved.I take advantage of the return of Col. Williams to your city, to send by him this letter in reply. I regret to learn from your Communication that the Apache Indians have caused trouble to the people of your State, and that they constantly Evade their merited punishment by Escaping into this Country. I can sympathize with you in this matter, for a similar thing occurs whenever our troops pursue and attempt to punish these and other Indians guilty of murders and robberies on this side of the Rio Grande -- they flee into Mexico. I fear this state of affairs is unavoidable until our respective Governments arrive at some understanding as to the treatment of these Indians and are prepared to faithfully execute the terms of such understanding. While it is impossible for me to authorize or permit Mexican troops to enter our territory, I am prepared at any time to cooperate with such forces in any manner that may be thought most effective in preventing these Indians from entering Mexico at all, either for purpose of trade or for depredation, or for their punishment, in case they do as there. Those Indians belong to Reservations in New Mexico and whenever found by our people absent from such Reservation without authority, they are always regarded and treated as hostile. If your countrymen would do the same thing, and treat them as hostiles whenever they are found in your country, I doubt if they would go there so frequently. It is charged, I will not say with truth, that these Indians find in Mexico a market for all the horses and other property stolen from this side the river. I trust that Col. Williams will be ably assisted, as I am informed he is, by your powerful aid and countenance, to remove these Indians not only from your Country, but quite away from the Rio Grande frontier. I am informed Your Excellency desires a map of the U.S., particularly of that part contiguous to your own State. I take great pleasure in forwarding you this map by Col.

No.  13 cs from these Headquarders (copy enclosed) was based upon the decision of the Judge Advocate General U.S Army  that, \"when the official promulgation is not of itself notice to the accused, the suspension takes effect from the date of the actual notice.\"  ( See Digest of opinions of the Judge Advocate General\npage 368, par 11, Ed 1868)  \n\nRespectfully returned to the Commanding Officer Fort Griffin.\nThe special Order of Colonel Wood fixing date of commencement of suspension of 1st Lieutenant Davidson 9th U.S. Cavalry, to be the time of actual notice to him is in accordance with legal decisions, and is legally correct.  The Adjutant General of the Army, however in a letter, of Sept. 9th, 1871 to the Commanding General Department of Texas, concurs with the view, that suspension should commence on date of order, as this is in mitigation of the strict legal view, it will be adopted in this case.  The Commanding General notices the use of the word protest in the communication of Lieut. Davidson and observes that a protest of a subordinate against the action of his superior and Commanding Officer is not permissable in the Army.  Any complaint of action of superiors should be by way of appeal.\nDept Texas]\nFeby 9 of 2]                   By Command of General General Augur\n\n                                                             (Sgd.)

Sergeant Bush states that he was retained in service beyond the term of his enlistment by his post Commander Lt. Col. W. [R?] Shafter to force him to pay for a private horse the property of Lieut. Custer which it is alleged was lost through his, Sergeant Bush's negligence.   This complaint is substantially true.   It is sustained by the records of the Post (certified copies of which are herewith enclosed) and by the free admission of Lieut. Col. Shafter himself.\nI find the following to be the facts in the case.  On the 4th of December 1871, Sergeant Bush arrived at Fort McKavett, Texas, on his return from escorting the remains of the late Capt. Porter, [?A.Q.M.?] to San Antonio, Texas, on the10 of December Major Merriam 24th Infantry placed a private horse the property of Lieut Custer 24th Infantry in charge of Serg't Bush with instructions to take good care of the animal and turn him over to Lt. C. on the arrival of the escort at Fort Davis.  Serg't Bush was also instructed not to ride the horse or permit others to do so.   The Sergeant signed a receipt in due form for the horse and left McKavett the next day Dec 11th.\n\n  It appears that the Sergeant rode the animal part of the way after leaving Fort Concho.  He states in extenuation that the horse being tied to a wagon inhaled all the dust of the train, and was manifestly impaired and distressed thereby.   In consequence of this the Serg't concluded to ride him.       Upon leaving Central Station on the Staked Plains some Antelopes were seen and Sergeant Bush was induced to loan Corporal Spriggs of Company C 9th Cavalry the horse for the purpose of getting a shot at them.  Corporal Spriggs was gone an entire day and did not rejoin the Command until it had reached the crossing of the Pecos River.  He then reported that the animal had become frightened and had thrown him and escaped with saddle and bridle on, as the horse had since been caught and taken to Fort Concho, the Corporal's story is fully corroborated.  When Sergt Bush and his detachment reached Fort Stockton, he reported the facts to Lieut. Col. Merritt of the 9th Cavalry who advised to sustain his statement by the","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69290,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69290","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b285244133db584340465f51bf9634b7.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b285244133db584340465f51bf9634b7.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b285244133db584340465f51bf9634b7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b285244133db584340465f51bf9634b7.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:22:50+00:00","modified":"2020-04-20T03:43:00+00:00","filename":"b285244133db584340465f51bf9634b7.jpg","authentication":"62a88a886a196d39b930aa09bbc0823a","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":66,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX03_00004_o2.jpg","size":595267,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2579,"compression_ratio":0.042743167750923},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000121"],"TimeCreated":["235915+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000121"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000121"],"TimeCreated":["235915+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000121"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000121"],"TimeCreated":["235915+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000121"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b285244133db584340465f51bf9634b7.jpg","FileDateTime":1522340517,"FileSize":595267,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2579\"","Height":2579,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2579,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 10:04:40","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3874},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:21 23:59:15","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:21 23:59:15","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":22,"SubSecTimeDigitized":22,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2579,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1034,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1034","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1872\naffidavits of his men.

It was also signed by Corporal Spriggs.\nWith this paper as his justification he proceded to Fort Davis, reaching that post on the 21st of December one day after the term of the enlistment had expired.\nOn the next day, December 22nd the discharge of Sergeant Bush was made out in due form by the Company Commander Capt. [?Schriver] of the 9th Cavalry and presented to Lieut. Col. Shafter Post Commander for his signature. Lt.Col. Shafter declined to sign the discharge until he would investigate the loss of Lieut.

This engaged the attention of Lt.Col.Shafter for two or three days, but on the 25th December he again called up Sergt. Bush and being dissatisfied with his statement as to the loss of the animal, he ordered the Sergeant to the guard house as a prisoner, as the 1st Sergt supposed that Sergt Bush was a discharged man he had it seems issued no rations since the 22nd and none were given him in the guard house, at least none from the Company Mess. The Sergeant was released on the morning of the 26th after one day's confinement.\nOn the 25th Lieut. Col. Shafter wrote a letter which is herewith enclosed to Dept. Hqrs. to enquire if he could hold Sergt. Bush responsible before a Military Court for the loss of a Private Horse, the answer was in the negative, when the answer was received, Lt.

I do not consider that Co. A had any claim to the books and property it brought to the Post, even any other Co. as it was Post Property and never belonged to the Company.  As to the 11th and 12th endorsement I have only to say that there is no question about Capt. French being at the Post on the 11th day of July and that he was in command of his Company. By an order issued on the 10th of July, he with his company was relieved from duty at the post, to take effect on the 11th, for that reason I did not consider him liable for any detail or duty on that day, unless in case of an emergency.  He was not therefore detailed as a member of the Council of Administration.

French and in no way concerned the Commanding Officer of Fort Clark as there is no complaint as to the valuation of the property, whether Capt. French had been a member of the member of the council or not it would have made no difference about the library, as I should not have permitted it to be distributed and broken into. In my opinion Company A had awarded it a much larger share of the post property than properly belonged to it if the division of property made by prior Council of which Capt French was senior member were just. By referring to the proceedings convened April 27 1871 page 89 it will be observed that these companies that were about leaving the post and that had equal claims on the Post Library that Co A had (unless the fact that Co A brought part of the books to the post while these companies brought none, gave to Co A claims superior to to theirs) got no share of the Post Library, or its value. The same in the case of Co C 9 Cavy. which left the post a short time before Co A left, see page 97 Post Council Book   All of these companies were at the post when Co's A & G of the 25th. came here and had an equal right in the library with Co A 25 Inf.

Assistant Adjutant General Department of Texas. \nSir, In obedience to instructions contained in endorsement, dated Hqrs Dept. of Texas August 8, 1871, I have the honor to report that the property belonging to the post consisting of library, clocks and garden implements were divided for the following reason  \n\n The library was not divided as such division would entirely ruin it, and if the practice of dividing out the books of a post library is followed all systematic efforts towards getting together a respectable library will be completely frustrated. The agricultural implements were not divided as they were required here for the use of the garden, I thought it much the best to estimate the value of the property and pay Company A its share as soon as it could be done. The post fund was bankrupt from the fact that nearly a thousand dollars of the post fund improperly obtained by assessments on Post Traders and Merchants doing business in the vicinity of the post, had by order of the Adjt. General of the Army, a short time prior to Co. A.'s leaving the Post to be refunded. The post fund is rapidly increasing and the amount appropriated as the money value of the shares of Co. A 25th Infantry will soon be forwarded.

Shafter, and that he justly considers himself entitled to an explanation from Col. Andrews which it is not doubted Col. Andrews will be glad to make.    Lt. Col. Shafter observes in regard to the absence of Capt. French from the Council, that his presence there \"would have made no difference about the library, as he (Lt. Col.

The Stores shipped for Fort McKavett on the Invoice referred to were generally those which had been received from the Depot within the present year.\nRespectfully forwarded to the Commissary General of Subsistence for his information.  I have no doubt but Capt.

I fear the difficulty arises from employes [sic] of officers making shipments of Stores - they will retain the best and send the poorest.\nThe rule should be the reverse of this.

Of these articles there has been shipped since Jany. 1, 615 lbs of Hams and 1128 Cans of Tomatoes.  When the Special Requisition was received there were none of these articles on hand which could be shipped without reducing the amounts ordered shipped to other posts as the amount on hand had been divided among the various posts in proportion to the number of officers to be supplied.  A shipment will soon be [?] to Fort McKavett of such articles remaining due as are on hand for shipment.  An extra shipment to Ft. Stockton to replace articles destroyed on the train at Howard's Well had the effect of reducing the am't on hand at Depot and consequently limited the amount that could be shipped.  It has not been the custom to fill such special requisitions until sufficient Stores are collected together to make up a train load.\nRespectfully returned to the Chief Commisary of Subsistence","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69302,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69302","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/34ee4f401b6ee7860e9db0370c639fd4.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/34ee4f401b6ee7860e9db0370c639fd4.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/34ee4f401b6ee7860e9db0370c639fd4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/34ee4f401b6ee7860e9db0370c639fd4.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:23:00+00:00","modified":"2020-04-22T03:08:43+00:00","filename":"34ee4f401b6ee7860e9db0370c639fd4.jpg","authentication":"e8281bee042e89cab565768548cf2a0e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":78,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX03_00010_o2.jpg","size":663678,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2843,"compression_ratio":0.043230155938563},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["000050+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["000050+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["000050+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"34ee4f401b6ee7860e9db0370c639fd4.jpg","FileDateTime":1522340517,"FileSize":663678,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2843\"","Height":2843,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2843,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 10:04:45","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3593},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:22 00:00:50","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:22 00:00:50","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":7,"SubSecTimeDigitized":7,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2843,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1034,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1034","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"[red ink] 1872\nof the Department.  The Commissary Genl regrets to see the frequency of these complaints of the Commissary Dept. from the posts above, and he is unable to see any reason why occasion need be afforded for them.  The government is liberal in providing for the wants of troops at frontier posts and expects that what it provides should be properly and carefully distributed and no reason is known why these expectations should not be fully carried out in this Dept.  In case of a few articles allowance must be made for climate, but generally, and particularly articles of such necessity as Hams, Sugar, Tomatoes &c, there can be no good reason why, that posts in this Dept. should be without them, and the reason assigned by the Chief Commissary why McKavett is without them is not regarded as sufficient.  Neither is the statement that a shipment will soon be made there of such articles as he may have on hand.  If the articles required are not on hand, immediate steps should be taken to procure them and to keep constantly on hand a sufficient supply of every article on the supply table to meet the demand of troops in the Department.  When commissary Stores are ready for any post the Chief Quartermaster should be notified, and he will determine when they can be sent.   Empty wagons have recently gone to McKavett which could have carried all the Stores necessary for the post.

Fort Richardson is conceded to be out of position to complete  it to the capacity of the present garrison, larger expenditures must yet be made there.  In view of these facts is it advisable to incur the trouble and expense of having these lands condemned?   Would it not be better to have the proper point, that must be in the country between Fort Sill and the Texas Pacific Rail Road selected and secured to the Government now, and to transfer it to all the troops from Richardson that cannot be properly quartered there without further expenditure.  Have plan of a new Post approved and all the building there done in conformity therewith.  As quarters at the new post are completed, other troops from Richardson can be transferred until the latter is no longer required.  If this is done it is believed that the land at Ft. Richardson owned by Mr. [?Foscue?] will be sufficient for the diminished garrison and as it is understood he is willing to rent his land there at a fair price I recommend that it be rented for such time as government requires, and that all the lands belonging to other owners be given up and the post be limited to Mr. [?Foscue's] land.

Norvell 10th Cav. the attention of the Dept. Comdr. is respectfully invited to the accompanying papers marked 1, 2 & 3, and the endorsements thereon.  They are enclosed as an evidence that Capt Norvell has before exhibited the same spirit as that manifested in the case he now lays before the Dept. Comdr.  I do not deem it necessary to say anything in explanation of my course towards this officer except that the leniency with which he has been treated would not have been exercised towards him, were he not in the main, a very good officer.  The duty required of Capt. Norvell was but trifling, and Lieut. [?Harmon's] services were very important on other urgent duty and it was impracticable on that day to detail another Officer in his place on the Board.   The Board took no action during Lt. Harmon's  temporary action and therefore Capt. Norvell did no writing in connection therewith except in making protests and complaints to his Commanding Officer.\nRespectfully returned to the C.O. Ft. Sill, I.T.   The Comdg. General thinks it was hardly necessary to have had these papers referred to him.  It is much better to have these misunderstandings arranged and quieted at the post when they occur.   The junior members of a Board of Survey is always ex-officio recorder of the same, and it is for the Commanding Officer to say, who or how many shall constitute the Board, though it is always better when practicable to observe the usual rule   Capt. Norvell's letters and endorsements are not courteous or respectful, and an officer of his rank and service should have known it.   The service can never be harmonious or efficient when officers stand and make complaints on small and immaterial points, officers have their rights which must be respected and at the same time they have their duties, one of the most important of which is to labor for harmony and efficiency in the Regiment or Post.

Genl whose attention is invited to the endorsement of the Chf Qur. of the Dept.   This discussion as to the relative merits of Pack Saddles has been in progress since I have been in service, and seems as far from a satisfactory conclusion as ever.  I agree entirely with the QM General that no pack saddle can be procured that will not in the hands of careless and ignorant packers, injure the mules.  At the same time it is to be observed that what is known as the Regulation pack saddle requires much greater care and watchfulness on the part of the packers than the aparajo and those two qualities being generally wanting in the class of packer usually employed, accounts for greater frequency of injury to animals from that saddle.   Colonel Holabird's suggestion of having two good skilled packers at each post from which most scouting is done is regarded favorably and I propose to adopt it for those posts.  In my opinion the Aparajo is much superior to any other form of pack saddle, for among others the following reasons.  It admits of greater variety in size and shape of pack.  In Oregon I have packed on them, half barrels of pork, brine being drawn off, and boxes of hard bread with impunity to animals.  It could not have been done with regulation pack saddles, with it, the weight of pack is better distributed over the animal and the bearing surface greater.  The centre of gravity of the pack coincides more nearly with that of the animal, doing away with the great [?leverage?] unavoidable when packs are suspended from Xtrees [crosstrees?].  There is much less danger, none in fact, of injury to the animal from the pack itself.  In going through brush or narrow defiles or if the animal falls, the aparajo is a protection to it.

The Commanding General doubts the legality of this Muster, and regrets that officers should permit their private differences to embarrass and  injure the public service.   These rolls as prepared and signed by the Adjt. 4th Cav should have been sent to Comdg Officer Ft. Richardson who should have mustered the Field, Staff & Band thereon.  If Lt. Parker is still at the post, new rolls should be made out and signed by him of the Regimental Field and Staff and Lt. Col Buell should sign them as Mustering Officer, as it is understood the Muster was actually made by him on other rolls.   It is thought he can with propriety Muster the Adjutant and Srgt Major as at the post, but this is not absolutely necessary.  He can muster them as absent at Regimental Hq Ft. Richardson.  There was no necessity whatever for this complication.  If Lt. Parker is not at the post the rolls already made out by him of which the enclosed are a part, should be sent to Lieut. Col.

Oct 12, 1872\nRespectfully returned to the C.O. Ft. Richardson, Texas,  This is a second time an officer has been arrested and charges preferred against him at Ft. Richardson, within the last two months for violation of a \"Circular\" or \"letter\" which it is claimed they never saw.  In his letter enclosed Capt. Jackson states that, \"It is not customary to furnish companies with copies of Circulars relating exclusively to officers.\"  This is wrong, all instructions and directions concerning duty at a post affecting either officers or men, should be promulgated as orders and placed upon each company order book as prescribed by regulations.  If officers do not  see orders then it is their own fault and they can be held responsible for faults committed in consequence.   It is not believed these charges can be sustained under the circumstances, and even if they could, it is doubtful, if frequent recourse to Courts Martial - either for officers or enlisted men is conducive to the best interests of the service, which requires a conscientious performance of duty - not one constrained by fear of punishment.\nThere are of course officers and soldiers who are to be restrained only by fear, but the number is believed to be small.  Certainly Capt. Jackson is not one of these, and it is not doubted if he had known the Circular in question, he would have strictly conformed to it.\nThe Circular is a very proper one, but it should be made an \"order\" and published to the Command.\nIt is advised that the charges be withdrawn and Capt. Jackson restored to duty.\nD.T. Oct 14 72\nBy Command of Genl Augur\n(Sgd) G. B. Russell\nA.A.A.

Colonel MacKenzie's  operations and those of the escorts to Rail Road surveying parties have driven them from their haunts in and about Staked Plains, and they have gone to Mexico as a safe place from which to continue their depredations on the Texas frontier.

I also enclose copy of letter from an American Merchant in Presidio del Norte giving reliable information concerning those Indians and their location in Mexico.

Div of the Mo.   I entirely concur in opinion with the petitioners as to the good results likely to grow out of the construction of a railroad from Austin to the Rio Grande, not only in settling and developing the country through which it passes, but in the increased facilities afford the Government in protecting & quieting the Rio Grande frontier now and for the last twenty five years harassed and despoiled by the depredating Indians and Mexicans.  Ft. Clark near the Rio Grande is two hundred and six miles from Austin, the nearest railroad point through this post, from the necessity of the case must pass its own supplies and those for Forts Duncan, Stockton, Davis, Quitman and Bliss, averaging  probably over four million pounds yearly.  Besides in the event of such a railroad being completed San Antonio, with Ft. McIntosh and probably Ruggles Barracks would be supplied by it at a great saving of time and expense.

This claim was instigated by General Reynolds when comdg. the Dept. and finally returned to me as Commander of he Post of Ft. Concho, endorsed.   \"The claim will not be paid\" the word cancelled was also written across its face.  A full explanation of the circumstances will be found in the endorsement of Capt. Hooker and myself which will probably be found on file in the office of the Adjt Genl of the Dept.  My own opinion is, that the account was entirely a private one.  Mr. Cloud was at the time living at the post and there is reason for supposing he knew, that Capt. Hooker had applied for a guide and had been refused by his commanding officer.  I am not myself aware of any gross misrepresentation having been made by Col. Shafter which influenced me in making my endorsements. (Sgd.) J. P. Hatch, Lt. Col. 4 Cav.\nRespectfully forwarded to the Adjt Genl.of the Army (thro Hq Mil Div. of the Mo.) for action of the War Dept.  The facts in this case appear from further inquiry to be as follows:  Capt. Hooker was ordered out with his Company on duty in a country entirely unknown to him, and refused a guide - I think imprudently - After leaving the post and about a mile from it he met Mr. Cloud who had been the post guide and engaged him to accompany his command as guide and for his services gave the enclosed voucher.  I am satisfied from enquiry that Mr. Cloud went in good faith and I think he should be paid.  If Captain Hooker exceeded his authority in hiring him, he should be the one to suffer and not Mr. Cloud.   It would appear that there was a bitter feud between Capt. Hooker and his C.O. Lt. Col. Shafter, 24 Inf. and this is the reason probably of all the trouble.   (Sgd) C. C. Augur   Brig. Gen USA  Comdg\nD.T.

These tickets called for 21 ounce loaves hence 6699 \u00bd  lbs of flour.  33 1\/6 Brls have been saved and the money collected.  This saving of 33 \u00bd Brls from 118 1\/2 Brls is about as great a saving as can be expected from a small bakery using not much more than 1\/2 Brl per day.  I do not think there is any loss in the Flour.  I would however call attention to one point which seems to have escaped the attention of the Post Comdr and the Post Council.  33 1\/6 Brls of Flour brought but $229.59 hence the flour savings have been sold at  $6 88\/100 pr. barrel.  The average price of flour has been for those months $9 95\/100 per barrel, a loss of $101 82\/100 has been sustained in the value of the savings.  This loss added to the amount collected $229.59 would have made the proper savings about $330.41 approximating to the amount ($400\/) the Post Commander estimated should have been realized.  It is probable that the leakage exists in the low price at which the Council has fixed the price of Bread Viz. 5[cents sign] per ration loaf of 21 ounces. (Sgd) S T Cushing Capt CCS\nRespectfully returned to Comdg Officer San Antonio, Tx   The Dept Comdr. sees no reason for any misunderstanding about such a matter as this. The Proceedings of the Council as recorded are certainly not very clear and afford no data for deciding whether proper savings have been made or not.  The endorsement of the Chf. Com. of Subs may throw some light on the subject.  Two things are very certain, 1st. Savings of Bakehouse never exceed in practice thirty percent - hardly can come up to it.  2d 21 ounces of bread cannot be sold for five cents with proper gain for Post Fund.  If Capt. Prince? desires the Council to make actual experiment at the bake house which I think would be well let, him order them specially.\nDT  May 10\/73\nBy Command of Gen'l Augur  \n(Sgd) C M Keever\nA A General\nGriffin Ft C.O.\n[red ink] 156\n\nEndorsement on Charges and Specifications preferred against Lt.

While I do not sustain any junior officer in using such language to a senior, I think the Adjutant was provoked by the communication of Capt. Catlin.  Up to this time these officers have been intimate friends.   In any event I do not think the charges properly made.  Under the circumstances nothing more than \"conduct to the prejudice of good order and mil. discipline\" can be sustained in my judgement.  I have tried to effect a reconciliation Lieut. Whitney has expressed a willingness to apologize in presence of other officers provided Capt. Catlin retreats what he has stated over his official signature, which up to the present time he had declined to do hence I can only forward the charges for your action.  Lt.

In attempting to do so he was the aggressor and should be first to offer reparation.  The trial of officers is to be avoided when possible and it is hoped Lt. Col.

Col. Frey's telegram was the first intimation received here, that it had been sent to Ft. Griffin. Orders were sent to Col. Buell, Comdg. that Post to have it returned at once to Camp Supply. Before this order reached him he sent it on with two companies of the 4th Cav to Ft. Concho, where Lt. Col. Merritt ordered it on with these Co's to Ft. McKevett. As soon as this was known, Lt. Col. M. Cook  was directed to have it returned at once to Camp Supply.  But before this order reached him he had sent it with the same Cos. to Ft. Clark. I cannot conceive the possibility of its being sent further and orders have been sent to him to have it returned immediately.  I cannot help thinking the officer in charge of this transportation has failed to represent fully and earnestly to the Officers sending it on, the great inconvenience that would result to Camp Supply.  Capt. Sanderson Comdg. Ft. Silll at the time is a careful and attentive officer and was honestly led I believe by the terms of the order he refers to, but I cannot understand the action of the other Comdg. officers, if they were aware of the great need of this transportation at Camp Supply.  They have all been called on for explanation.  I have been hurrying them up as much as possible to get the balance of MacKenzie's Regt. to him much needed at this time - and they were probably short of transportation for the emergency which they may have regarded sufficiently imminent to justify the use they made of the transportation.  This case fully exemplifies the great inconvenience we are subjected to here by reason of the entire absence of telegraphic communication with interior posts, and our insufficient mail with Forts Concho and McKevett, we have a triweekly communication with Ft. Clark, Duncan, Stockton and posts above, a semi-weekly & with Griffin a mail communication but once a week.

Serg't Kroos was not responsible for the property, Lt. Neely was, and it was the duty of the latter to exercise every precaution to guard against losses or damage to the property, failing to do this and not presenting any evidence to show that he had taken proper care of it, he should not be relieved of any part of the responsibility for the losses sustained.

CO\n312\nEndorsement on Communication from the A.J Advocate of the Dept. relative to a communication of Lt. Col. Buell forwarding charges against Capt. Keyes, 10 Cav together with other enclosures, a copy of request for a Court of Inquiry by Capt. Keyes &c (3111 DT 74)\n2658 DT 74 (3006 DT 74 & 5 Encl filed with 3111 DT 74\nRespectfully to CO Ft. Griffin.  The Commanding Genl does not regard this case as one requiring a Court of Inquiry.  All the issues that facts of the case seem to be admitted by both sides.   While Capt. Keyes should be tried on some of the charges preferred against him to do so at this time when the services of the officers necessary for a Court are essential in the field, would, it is feared, cause greater injury to the service than that likely to be corrected by it.  Under these circumstances it is directed that he be released from arrest and ordered to his company.\n\n   While Capt Keyes escaped a trial, he must understand that his conduct in this whole transaction from first to last is not approved.\n   Lieut. Col. Buell's arrangement for making his scouts effective by contracting baggage and limiting transportation was soldierly and eminently proper, and it was the duty of Capt. Keyes, being in command of a company to have been one of the first to set the example of ready and cheerful obedience.\n   In the field after Indians is no place for officers to make or stand upon small points, or to permit their personal or professional preferences to interfere with the dispositions or desires by the Cmdg Officer, and no thorough soldiers will do so.  It is believed that Capt Keyes has cause of complaint that Lt. Col. Buell took action against him on the report of another officer without ascertaining such to be the fact, the Genl. Comd'g believes Lt. Col. Buell to have been misled by the report of Lt. Cratt and thinks he erred in not sending for the officers referred to and learn from them direct their real intent and purposes.   While a Comdg Officer may not properly order that two officers shall Mess together, he can so limit transportation and baggage the the messing together will follow as a necessity.   \n  This is what should have been done in this case, as it is presumed to have been a matter of indifference too Lt. Col. Buell what officers Messed together his idea being merely to limit baggage & transportation to his idea of what was necessary.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":69330,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/69330","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7ba6cf25e20e913095401b918c0760c7.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7ba6cf25e20e913095401b918c0760c7.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7ba6cf25e20e913095401b918c0760c7.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7ba6cf25e20e913095401b918c0760c7.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-29T16:23:26+00:00","modified":"2020-04-28T00:08:59+00:00","filename":"7ba6cf25e20e913095401b918c0760c7.jpg","authentication":"a383afe48157cd23b1e914b877c5e3f8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":106,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_3008_BX03_00024_o2.jpg","size":629337,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2857,"compression_ratio":0.040792400731148},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["000714+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["000714+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000122"],"TimeCreated":["000714+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000122"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7ba6cf25e20e913095401b918c0760c7.jpg","FileDateTime":1522340518,"FileSize":629337,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2857\"","Height":2857,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2857,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 10:04:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3475},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:22 00:07:14","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:22 00:07:14","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":41,"SubSecTimeDigitized":41,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2857,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1034,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1034","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"It was entirely competent and proper for him to have done so, to a still greater extent, and if any of his officers grumbled and expressed discontent with the arrangement, he was justified in leaving them behind. \n\n  The Comdg Genl observed with regret that the name of Lt.

Davidson and the Indian Agent as to what Indians are to be permitted to come in.  This difference of opinion is likely to increase and to to [sic] extend to other points and may lead to unfortunate results.   There should be but one authority to communicate with the Indians and should be settled at once which authority that is - Military or the civil agents.

So far as Agent Richards knows, half of those Penne-teth-Kas Comanches may have been out with the hostile bands.   Second.  It furnishes additional evidence of the propriety of my request that this band of Comanches should be returned to the Agency, where it properly belongs, and where it will receive its needed supervision.

Satanta was unquestionably guilty of the offense for which he was originally tried according to his statement made publicly at the time of his arrest in May 1871, and also his statement in the Court which tried him, when he was asked \"why sentence of death should not be imposed upon him.\"    Sentence of death was commuted to imprisonment for life.

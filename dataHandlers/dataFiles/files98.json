One short week after tomorrow and our charming cousin, who has already commenced to nibble at the enticing bait will be fairly caught in the trap. So sad day shall that be to our sweet cuz, I hope, for many a delicious morsel does that trap contain and may many a bright day of future bliss dawn on its inmates. Mary sends a note in this to her brother in regard to getting cake. If Henry says anything to you about it you will of course assist him to select it. Give your advice in favor of good sized loaves so that she may be sure to have enough. You know we don't want a very leetle piece we don't have some wedding cake every day. I hope you will come up for your share, but you know best how it will be about your business. I will not advise you to leave if it will be an injury to you, we will save some cake for you and tell you just how they act. I suppose they will do it up right as Sarah has been very faithful in giving Mary lessons in the part she must take, and his sisters, no doubt, are as good to him. If you come up that day mother says I can return with you, if not I will be down in a day or so after. Should you think I cannot be of much use to you just let me know, and I shall content myself to remain at home. Mary tells Henry if he does not feel able to get her any to speak to you to get some.

Thank you, dear brother, for your promptness and also for leaving ours in the bank till the interest become due. We hope you did not incommode yourself out of kindness to us. Your letter, Robert, has done us much good we could but feel and say, \"what a good letter this is.\" It is indeed sweet to trust all things in the hands of God.

I am ashamed to own that I should thus yield to disappointment. A strange infatuation hung over me, I shrunk from the pen as men do from the leprosy, but I hope the spell is at length broken.\nThank you, my sister, for writing to me, and especially for making your letter short.

I have repented more than once that I ever took them up. I hope you will ask mother to send them soon. If there is no earlier opportunity perhaps they can be sent with Mary Thomas next Saturday. I hope they will not be forgotten as indeed this is the most important business of my letter. It is snowing a little just now. We have not had much sleighing as yet. Ask Sarah if she succeeds in cultivating her self-esteem as Mr. Fowler advised. I find it quite a task. Tell mother that I found three more of her plates down here. I will send them up at the first opportunity. I have not baked any thing yet but I will try to soon. We have no cooking stove up now. How is Mary's head now? Does she succeed in taking any treatment? I am glad to hear that you have a girl. I hope she will prove just the one mother wants. I am glad that you are again taking packs?. I hope the next time I hear you will have tried the sitz-bath.

Was your satchel a great inconvenience to you? or did you find someone of the genus homo to carry it from one car to the other? We feared you would regret that it was not checked. Hope you are getting over your weariness and that your journey did not hurt you any. What did mother say of my leaving you to go home alone \nMrs. Thomas, you know, does not take treatment now. She is not so well. I fear she will lose what she has gained. Saturday, I think it was, she came in my room shaking violently. I never before saw any one so bad. It did not last a great while but she has not been so well since. She seems more unhappy than she used to, you know how she is situated and now her husband is at the farm. She said yesterday she wished she had a home. She is not contented here and she could not be satisfied there. Be sure and remember her when you write for a little word of remembrance does her a great deal of good. Mrs. Smith has just been in to ask me if I will remain in the sitting room a little while as the girls work to wash my windows.

The afternoon discourse was preached by Rev.

The gay music of birds came stealing in before we had time to throw back the shutters. They were chanting right merrily their welcome to Spring. I sought in vain for a view of these little musicians, but they were not to be seen and I was forced to be content with listening to their songs; an easy task truly, for who could complain while enjoying such a treat? Joyfully did we unite with these unseen singers in saluting Spring, the bright Harbinger of freshness. We could distinctly see her footsteps on the mountain side and on the plain.

Love to aunt, Jonny is a pretty good boy. He wants to see you very much. I fear you are expecting me every day and of course are as often disappointed. The blossoms of hope when blighted make a sad looking bouquet of which I doubt not you are already quite tired. But cheer up my sister, \"all is well that ends well,\" your long disappointment will I think end the first of next week in seeing mother or me enter your room. We did intend going the last of this week, but we were so busy with the hay that it was difficult to leave. Yesterday it was too wet to work in the lot and ma and Elizabeth thought of going then or you should have had a letter, it commenced raining however just as they we preparing to start and they were obliged to give it up. We are or rather they are very busy with the Cen. just now. They are printing the last side of the first form to day. I have not set any so far this month but I think I shall have to. I have but very little time to write as the flats are waiting for me to iron and it is friday.

Next monday is to be observed as a fast day. We shall have no school and it is earnestly desired that all should observe the day. Tuesday our new series commences and friday morning the term closes. I do not know why they begin the series before the next term unless it is to be all ready to go to work then. I have paid out about $400 for books and do not know how much more I must spend. We are all required to wear flannel which cost me 45 cents. I have used all the letter paper that I brought from home and bought 1\/2 a quire to day. We use a great deal of paper here.

I wish it were practicable for you to get me some unclear glasses. I use those of mother's to set but they are not clear and I often find it hard to see. 20 I suppose is the right number.

It was such a treat to receive one from my father. Dear father, I thank you very much for your sacrifice of those precious moments spent in writing that well commenced family letter. Oh! that the others had been so faithful, then indeed it would almost seem as though I had seen all our pleasant family circle at my own loved home. That \"ancient scrap\" as you call it has however furnished me with a very pleasant chat with my father and mother and a short one with Sarah my sister. The regulations of our school I have already learned to love, not not only as being necessary but as the best that could be formed for a school of this size and character. There have been instances of girls here becoming sick in consequence of receiving food from their friends or purchasing, and therefor they made a rule in relation to it, so it has been with the other requirments of this nature; they have formed them as the case required, for example, our dining hall has been rather noisy before sitting down to the table and after rising while we were going out, Miss Whitman requested the young ladies several times to be more quiet, but this had on effect; so a new regulation was added to the others, that we should not speak at all after entering the dining hall until we sit down nor at all after rising from table. I suppose I should say in connection with this that when we go to table we all stand back of our own chairs until the tardy bell strikes, which is a sign for us all to be in our places, and then Miss Whitman makes","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":24743,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/24743","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/f7dcba5bb869174d4745682b877b068f.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/f7dcba5bb869174d4745682b877b068f.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/f7dcba5bb869174d4745682b877b068f.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/f7dcba5bb869174d4745682b877b068f.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-05T14:39:12+00:00","modified":"2020-01-16T22:16:22+00:00","filename":"f7dcba5bb869174d4745682b877b068f.jpg","authentication":"568fe64b219db37b75eb3c9e1da205cd","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_04_fl_156_001_02_o2.jpg","size":1437686,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2736,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.048654632337015},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["010323"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["010323"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["010323"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["010323"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20160316"],"TimeCreated":["010323"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20160316"],"DigitalCreationTime":["010323"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"f7dcba5bb869174d4745682b877b068f.jpg","FileDateTime":1507214290,"FileSize":1437686,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2736\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2736,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"ApertureFNumber":"f\/5.6"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Camera Raw 9.1.1 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:07:08 13:34:02","Exif_IFD_Pointer":166},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.008,"FNumber":5.6,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:03:16 01:03:23","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:03:16 01:03:23","ShutterSpeedValue":6.965784,"ApertureValue":4.970854,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":28,"SubSecTimeOriginal":0,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":98,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/98","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"the first move, so you see we may not speak before the benediction is pronounced.

I do hope that Dr. Fitch will be able to help her. How long since Dr. Gittean has ceased to attend her? Did he consider her case as hopeless or did he think all the time that he could help her? I wish I could pass this next vacation with her, but this may not be and I am content to do that which is for the best. I do not think I should be homesick at all if Sarah was only getting well. It often seems strange to me, how I could ever summon courage to come so far to school and leave her so sick at home. I would write to her to night but my time is so far spent that I fear I cannot. I shall surely write next tuesday evening, if God permits. Tell her to keep up courage as well as she can. I wish Mary could be at home with her, I fear she is very lonely. Tell Gwen that I am very thankful to her for coming to keep my sister company and I shall ever love her for it. I hope Sarah's head will soon be better. Does it affect her eyes any?

I have taken down all the curtains and valance to wash, which makes the room more dreary than usual this evening. I received a letter from Elizabeth and Mary last sat. eve. I was glad to hear by it that Sarah is still improving, hope she will be quite smart when I return.

I felt quite disappointed in not being able to go, but if I return next year I hope to go then.

Expect to take a walk out this afternoon. I have not been much sick and think it very strange how I lost any strength so?; perhaps it was because I did not exercise it. Last thurs. eve, the night I received your letter, Rev. Dr. Pour, who has been a missionary to Ceylon? 30 years and expects own to return, lectured in the sem. hall to the young ladies, I was very sorry not to be able to attend. They say he was very interesting. \"His text was, come thou with us, and we will do thee good.\" I have not heard a great deal about what he said, but one thing Hattie told me I thought I must relate to father. He said that there was only one class of females in Ceylon? who ever learned to read, they were called the dancing girls and they read in order to learn the songs. They never married and were regarded as the wives of the gods. They frequently steal children and educate them for dancing girls. He mentioned, this as one instance, a young girl who had charge of a white babe carried it out one day and the babe went to sleep, she laid it down in the shade and steped the other side of the bushes to pick some berries, while she was gone the dancing girls found the child and stole it.

There has been quite an excitement here the past week, I told you in my last that three young ladies had been sent home. This was but the beginning of the troubles four more have gone and it is feared that others must leave before order and quietness can be restored. The teachers all have a very hard time and some of them are almost sick. As Miss Whitman and Miss Hazen are both absent the trustees have examined the cases of the unclear ladies and they decide their fate. I cannot tell you what their offence is as it is a long story I will leave that till I come home. They seem to have no regard for the teachers, themselves or any one else.

May 3, 1858\nDear Mother:\nWe received your kind letter this morning, could you have seen us read it, you would not have thought it was \"not worth receiving.\" Your letters are always welcome, dear mothr, and this doubly so, being such good news. Why Anna found her cup of joy so full that it ran over in pearly tears. You say that it seems a long time since you have heard from us, forgive us if we ever cause you anxiety by our neglect, we try to write every week but sometimes one leaves it for the other till perhaps the week is gone. We shall try not to have it so again the next seven weeks. It seems too good to be true, to think of Father coming to Chicago. Oh, how I wish he could come here and see how and what his daughters are doing. It would only take seven and a half hours to come from C. here and then it would always seem so much pleasanter, if we should remain, to think that father had seen our place of labor. Besides, it seems that a little of pa's advice would do me so much good. You know a little of the troubles here. Last Friday the trustees met and elected Mr. Curtiss, president, 11 voting for and 10 against him. I know but little about him but I have heard nothing favorable. I do not know what is my duty, sometimes I almost think I ought to resign. I wish I could see for a little time that we might talk over matters.

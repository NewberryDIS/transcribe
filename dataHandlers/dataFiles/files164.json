Have been quite weak much of the time and think, if I had called in a physician and allowed him to treat me as he thought best, that I might have had a feaver with all the attachments but I just got along with all that and now am feeling nearly well except the cough. I need to be very careful about my diet yet. Expect I shall feel much better after a little more care than I did before.\nWe are all longing for another letter from you. We want to know how you are physically, and how you get along farming.

The tornado was at Hartford at 4.30 just about half an hour after we reached Emporia.  It was plaily seen from Olpe, and also from the tops of the buildings at Emporia but we did not see it.  The storm area was about 300 feet in width.  It formed a few miles south west of Hartford and rained about 2 or 3 miles north east of that place.  It commenced raining about 7.30 P.M.  We did not return from Emporia until next morning.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":38072,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/38072","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/c06af478fb440ccfa609cf81ef62183b.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/c06af478fb440ccfa609cf81ef62183b.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/c06af478fb440ccfa609cf81ef62183b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/c06af478fb440ccfa609cf81ef62183b.jpg"},"added":"2017-10-18T15:18:12+00:00","modified":"2020-01-21T17:40:19+00:00","filename":"c06af478fb440ccfa609cf81ef62183b.jpg","authentication":"90ae23dc5243ed2c174c366d7ccf32a8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"mms_everett_ser_01_box_12_fl_455_066_04_o2.jpg","size":1208050,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":0,"item":{"id":164,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/164","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Needs Review","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"There has been a business change in Olpe during the last month.

Then came Afternoon sports which were Egg and Feather race, Blind mans potato ring squabble, Wheel-barrow race, Sack race, foot race, Climbing the treased pole and the firing of the Japanese day fireworks of Ragmuffin.  And in the evening we had music by the bands and fireworks which were very nice.  We had a very nice time.  Uncle Jimmie, Aunt Amelia & the children were there.  It rained in the evening some.

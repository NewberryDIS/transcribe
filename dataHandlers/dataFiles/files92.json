It is more than a week since I have heard from home.  I want very much to know what you think of the proposition -- made in my last letter.  I wish I could see some of you, so as to talk it over about the piano.  Perhaps you would think best for me to visit awhile to see how I get along teaching music before I get one.  What do you all think about it?  I should think you have had time enough to have some thoughts about it.  If you would only secret them to one in some shape, I should feel relieved.

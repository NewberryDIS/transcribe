I have just received your letter and believe me when I assure you that I said confound the pencil at least ten times before I finished reading the letter. After holding my head as near the candle that I scorched my hair most outrageously and after guessing at two thirds of the words I made out to finish reading that letter written with a pencil- an article I always detest unless one is writing some love letter which he or she desires to have go into oblivion as soon as it is once read by the cherished idol. Luckily I'm not so situated as to make it at all necessary for me to use a pencil for such a purpose. I was just wishing that I could hear from home when the mail came in &amp; brought your letter and I was very glad (though written with a pencil) to get it; but I will take this occasion to express my utter abhorence to pencils. Accept my thanks for your wish that I may have a happy new year; and please take the same wish from me to yourself.

No more cooking utensils than appear absolutely necessary will be allowed, and the company officers will see that the mess is arranged so as to require as little as possible. Articles such as chairs matts stools and luxeries of every kind will be prepared to be turned over at a moments warning. Bands sutlers and extra servants will be left behind and extra horses public or private turned over to the Post Q M the moment an order to this effect is issued. The proper officers will forthwith see to the early execution of this order having inspections of regiments and companies and files from day to day until every extra article is in condition to be readily & safely deposited in a few hours after a final order to move may be given.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":53494,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/53494","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/403b3a05a82dde1249de6d9d17871509.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/403b3a05a82dde1249de6d9d17871509.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/403b3a05a82dde1249de6d9d17871509.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/403b3a05a82dde1249de6d9d17871509.jpg"},"added":"2017-12-20T18:01:08+00:00","modified":"2020-01-23T22:02:07+00:00","filename":"403b3a05a82dde1249de6d9d17871509.jpg","authentication":"39753958a82c52a8fe1cebb54fa97757","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/civilwarletters\/archive\/fullsize\/fd2ac98dd9e03bd6ba092361de0d38b0.jpg","size":160091,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":642,"resolution_y":800,"compression_ratio":0.10390122014538},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"403b3a05a82dde1249de6d9d17871509.jpg","FileDateTime":1513792868,"FileSize":160091,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"642\" height=\"800\"","Height":800,"Width":642,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":5853,"ImageLength":3836,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"Compression":1,"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Orientation":1,"UndefinedTag:0x0001":"\u0003","XResolution":350,"YResolution":350,"PlanarConfiguration":1,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2013:06:13 12:23:33","Exif_IFD_Pointer":256},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":394,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":3780},"EXIF":{"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2818,"ExifImageLength":3512}}}},"item":{"id":821,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/821","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"John J.

There has been considerable trouble with this regiment on account of the clothing which we received from the State of Ills. At the time it was delivered to us it was represented as a gift of the State. It runs along without anything being said about it until we received our pay two months ago when we found ourselves charged with the old Ill. clothing and a portion of the pay for the clothing deducted from the pay which was due us on that day. It was then understood that we were to have small amounts deducted from our pay each payday until the said clothing was paid for in full. This was rather limiting the spending the money of the boys. Our captains thinking we were charged exhortitant prices called for a board of survey. This the Col. was compelled to grant because it is provided for by the army regulations.

Genl. Asboth was out to see our dress parade last night. After our going through with the manual of arms he clapped his hands as an indication that he was pleased with our appearance. We have had only three mails since we left Springfield. Why dont you send some papers. We never see one and dont know whether the army is moving or not. If you have the New York Tribune send it if you please. Reading matter is very scarce with us. Give my love to all inquires. I loaned part of my pay to one of our boys thence shall not send any home this time. Joseph Patterson has been quite sick; but is now well again. Write often. Scold Lucy Sampson for not writing. I send a Cotten pod. My health is good. Your affect. Bro.

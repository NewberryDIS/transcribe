Moseley does not wish his name known in the affair.  By all accounts he is a man of bad character. - The commissioners are happy to state that during their journey they discovered no marks of anything but peace &  quietness.\nMay 4. - John Rofs, Principal Chief, writes from Park Hill to Gen: Arbuckle.

On the first intelligence of this unhappy occurrence, he had immediately requested his brother-in-law, John G.Ross, accompanied by Mr Lenoir  others to repair to the residence of Mr Boudinott  and ascertain the facts, with a view of their being reported to Gen: Arbuckle.  They had just returned with a message from Mr Boudinott, confirming the report, and advising Mr Ross to leave home for safety, as Stand Watie was resolved to raise a company & forthwith to take the life of Mr.Ross.  He is at a loss to conccive why he is there to be murdered without guilt of any crime; therefore, for the sake of justice, he trusts Gen: Arbuckle will at once interpose and prevent the effusion of innocent blood and thus by the interposition of his authority, enable an unbiassed investigation to be had.-\nJune 23.\nGen: Arbuckle answers Mr Ross from Fort Gibson.  The chief's letter had arrived late the evening before. Independent of the express, Gen: Arbuckle had sent the nephew of Mr Ross to him, advising him immediately to retire to the fort, provided he felt himself insecured at his residence. The General  says he greatly regrets the murder of Mr Boudinot: he fears the report f John Ridge having been killed is also true; if so, he apprehends a civil war in the nation.  Hence he with very little delay had sent an express to the western Chiefs, Brown, Looney & Rosen, requesting their attendance as  soon as possible at the fort where he expects them on the following Tuesday.

He adds that if any of the persons charged with the late murders are there, they are not known to him  or have they been reported to him: Though, from the threats which have been made against him personally, he does not know but that he may be looked upon as one himself.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70881,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70881","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/a420e83f6f4b302df139ba6a58ad26ac.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/a420e83f6f4b302df139ba6a58ad26ac.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/a420e83f6f4b302df139ba6a58ad26ac.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/a420e83f6f4b302df139ba6a58ad26ac.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:49:46+00:00","modified":"2020-04-05T18:44:11+00:00","filename":"a420e83f6f4b302df139ba6a58ad26ac.jpg","authentication":"f47ec177fb9baa71e2f8d5914153e756","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL06_00019_o2 copy.jpg","size":558352,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2379,"compression_ratio":0.043463017452088},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["025924+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["025924+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["025924+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"a420e83f6f4b302df139ba6a58ad26ac.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424962,"FileSize":558352,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2379\"","Height":2379,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2379,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:12:53","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":4374},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 02:59:24","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 02:59:24","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":47,"SubSecTimeOriginal":47,"SubSecTimeDigitized":47,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2379,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1055,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1055","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"1839.\nJune 24.\ngov: M: Stokes  US.

from the late Cherokee Council:- He is exceedingly matified & distressed at  the late transactions in the nation; tending to  disturb the peace & tranquillity of the Cherokee people: He most sincerely wishes that there violent measures had not been resorted to, because he fears they are not to end now:- He  adds that, with respect to the monies due for the Cherokee annuities, none had come on; and if any should, the Agent would not feel himself authorised to make a distribution in the present state of affairs, without express instructions from the war department.\nJune 26\nGen: Arbuckle writes to Adjutant General \"not clear\", Washington City, from fort Gibson.  He transmits 7 documents in relation to the late outrages in the Cherokee nation .*   He had attended, by invitation from several of the Chiefs, a Cherokee Council which had assembled early in the month, for the purpose, as he understood, of entering in to such arrangements with the late emigrants as would satisfy all the Cherokees.  The United  States Agent was also present.  They soon perceived a difficulty between the old settlers and late emigrants, which was likely to present the expected re-union.  They exercised what influence they could to bring about a friendly understandings, but to no purpose.  The old settlers contended that their Government being effective, it was in their opinion a fair participation in the government, to permit the new emigrants to vote for officers when vacancies occurred.  The new emigrants wished a convention called to frame a new constitution for the whole nation's government.: to this the old settlers objecting, the council broke up without any arrangements.  Soon after, on the morning of the 22d, news reached Fort Gibson that John Ridge had been killed' the same afternoon it was reported that Mr Boudinot was killed; and on 23rd that Major Ridge , the father of John, was also killed. Subsequent information shows that all three were killed on the same day, the 22d;- and although John Ridge lived seventy five miles from that fort, news of his death reached there within a few hours of the time it was said to have taken place. The general refers to the communication of Mr Ross on the 24th , as showing that a general convention would be held soon,  within a few miles of his residence.  The General had conversed on the subject with some of the chiefs & principal men;- they told him the notification had not been general, as they themselves had not been informed of it; hence he infers that the convention  may be  composed \n\n 1.

The writers feel the greatest desire for unity & harmony a-mong all classes of their Cherokee brethren: to effect this desired object it was, that they had proposed in their communication to them on the 28th of June to meet them at Fort Gib-son on the 25th of July, in order to adjust all difficulties.  They had felt, in so doing, that they  were acting with at least doubtful authority; but they believed the interval would allow them time to consult their people, of whose approval of their proposition they entertained no doubt.  They regretted very much that they were notfavored with any answer to their distinct proposition.  They declare that nothing would give them more pleasure than to meet their brethren, that their differences might be ami-cably settled; but it is their conscien-tious opinion that they cannot do so without consulting their people.

And as to Elbert Harvey, my Grandson, there are not words enough to express what a jewel he is, manly, tender courteous, self sacrificing, always willing to accommodate himself to your wishes and yet a man of force, and ability, and a great student but his sweet disposition, and christian character, with a level head, he is just like his Mother, with many forceful traits like his Father. I think him perfect.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":76658,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/76658","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/7b273d60dd4d4e9fe77a3efe9dce0102.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/7b273d60dd4d4e9fe77a3efe9dce0102.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/7b273d60dd4d4e9fe77a3efe9dce0102.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/7b273d60dd4d4e9fe77a3efe9dce0102.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-13T15:09:00+00:00","modified":"2020-04-09T11:56:52+00:00","filename":"7b273d60dd4d4e9fe77a3efe9dce0102.jpg","authentication":"b8e44e77023b5968563fc70b6771608c","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":213,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03a_224_o2.jpg","size":1285695,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2562,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.046465977101223},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180105"],"TimeCreated":["105919"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180105"],"TimeCreated":["105919"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180105"],"TimeCreated":["105919"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"7b273d60dd4d4e9fe77a3efe9dce0102.jpg","FileDateTime":1531494535,"FileSize":1285695,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2562\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2562,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:09 16:16:46","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:05 10:59:19","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:05 10:59:19","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":18,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1894,"ExifImageLength":2661,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803254,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1096,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1096","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Russell Houstons baby dead July 27\nWednesday, July 31, 1901\nMrs Judge Bland Ballard dies Aug 2nd\nThis is a beautiful day sunny & fresh breeze.

We built a fire and encamped for the night as we could not move until the wounded men were properly cared for.  In the morning we made a litter to carry one of the wounded, the other could ride horseback and then pursued our course and in four days march found Gaunto.

We Killed a good many buffalo and then returned to the fort. The Blackfeet Indians must have seen us while we were hunting for that night they came to the fort and stole every horse we had. We were encamped outside the fort, but our animals were in one of the corrals belonging to it. During the night our sentinel saw two men approach let down the bars and drive out the horses, thinking that they were men of our party turning out the animals to graze he made no outcry. We were now afoot and had to remain so for about a month till McCoy came and we joined him and started for the rendezvous on the Green river. He had plenty of animals and we purchased those we needed from him.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":67403,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/67403","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/3ecf694fb2f93ef5a172fd440ea89269.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/3ecf694fb2f93ef5a172fd440ea89269.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/3ecf694fb2f93ef5a172fd440ea89269.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/3ecf694fb2f93ef5a172fd440ea89269.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-28T13:25:39+00:00","modified":"2020-04-04T20:29:03+00:00","filename":"3ecf694fb2f93ef5a172fd440ea89269.jpg","authentication":"00f1a8afc993a9a3f795543992bccdb2","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_139_00017_o2 copy.jpg","size":747105,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2397,"compression_ratio":0.057719139665322},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000104"],"TimeCreated":["014628+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000104"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000104"],"TimeCreated":["014628+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000104"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20000104"],"TimeCreated":["014628+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20000104"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"3ecf694fb2f93ef5a172fd440ea89269.jpg","FileDateTime":1522243517,"FileSize":747105,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2397\"","Height":2397,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2397,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:27 16:39:14","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6176},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:04 01:46:28","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:04 01:46:28","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":24,"SubSecTimeDigitized":24,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2397,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1018,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1018","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"In six days we reached the rendezvous at the mouth of Horse creek on the Green river, and staid there for some twenty days.

PETERS\nTo the Editor of the Post: (Boston)\n\n  Sir -- The article in the Post regarding Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel and Surgeon De Witt C. Peters' \"Life of Kit Carson\" is of more than passing interest to Bostonians. He had charge of the hospital at Fort Warren, Boston Harbor during the Civil war, and Mason and unclear were under his care there. The son of Colonel Peters referred to and into whose hands the MS. came at Colonel Peters' death was William Theodore Peters, an officer de \"l'Academie Francais,\" This W.T. Peters was a friend of MacMonnies the noted sculptor and stood as model for MacMonnies' noted figure of \"Nathan Hale\" which stands in City Hall Par, New York City.\n   \"The Life of Kit Carson,\" by Colonel Peters is out of print, but the writer, s nephew of Colonel Peters, possesses a copy. When stationed at Fort McHenry, Baltimore, during the Civil war, even the roughest patients were devoted to Colonel Peters, and it was there that his health began to break down, owing to his overwork as a surgeon and it may be truly said--he gave his life for others.\n    Boston.

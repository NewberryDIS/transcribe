JONES, NOTARY PUBLIC\nFOWLER, MEADE CO., KANSAS, Sept 29 1906,\nMy Dear Aunt Mary:--\nI have been rather uncertain, I fear, in my correspondence lately. I have been quite busy for the last two weeks. I guess I have not written to you within that time. Two weeks ago Dr. Thayer, our State H.M. Superintendent visited Ford, and preached on Sunday morning, and went to the country and preached Sunday night. He was to have held a service in Ford again in the evening, but a heavy all night rain prevented it. Peculiar circumstances got me wet to the skin that night on my way from where I ate supper to my boarding place. On my way, I stopped at the church where I had noticed light, though it had been pouring all evening. I found two young ladies--\nsisters--there + their brother. They were waiting for it to stop raining--a hopeless wate--crossed out wait, as it proved. Though wet through, I stayed with them an hour and a half, until eleven oclock. Then I prevailed on them to go home.

Topeka State Journal\nFRANK P. MACLENNAN\nTopeka, Kans., August 26, 1908.\nMy Dear Aunt Mary:\nWe got to Topeka safely at 1:20 P.M. today. Howard had met an earlier train but before we reached the main part on a street car, he somehow saw us on the car and so we came together. We ate dinner with him and then Helen and I looked around in the stores for the few things we wanted to buy. We ate supper with the Wilcox's and are fixed up for the night in a good hotel. I have come down to the journal office to spend a few minutes with Howard who has had some writing to do and now we are both going back to the hotel for a little visit with his mother. Howard is writing this for me at my dictation and is a very rapid writer\nWe had a pleasant journey. Edward and I enjoyed it very much, but the others got rather tired.\nBryan speaks here tomorrow night, but I fear that we will not be able to remain to hear him.\nHoward sends his love with mine, and will write in a few days.\nMost Affectionately Your Nephew,\nJE.

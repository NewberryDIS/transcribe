We will have a wagon made for him. I bought also for my boys two black New Foundland pups, very large for their age. They are only six weeks old. Our old black horse is not well, so we intend to send him in the country. Mrs F.C. Buster and Miss Isaacs live opposite to us.

He is new driving Mrs Durand's carriage. My sisters, and their good children, make our house very gay. Our children are all so good with each other, and love their Aunts and Cousins, they don't quarrel.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":74359,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/74359","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/8418073ed61c9f0cbbcfd96f5d6a6d0b.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/8418073ed61c9f0cbbcfd96f5d6a6d0b.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/8418073ed61c9f0cbbcfd96f5d6a6d0b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8418073ed61c9f0cbbcfd96f5d6a6d0b.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-11T19:01:07+00:00","modified":"2020-03-18T22:12:43+00:00","filename":"8418073ed61c9f0cbbcfd96f5d6a6d0b.jpg","authentication":"446bfbf2072d9dc1396f2ba29032fd9e","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":53,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03_058_o2.jpg","size":1096714,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2213,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.045886847082057},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["134858"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["134858"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["134858"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8418073ed61c9f0cbbcfd96f5d6a6d0b.jpg","FileDateTime":1531335609,"FileSize":1096714,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2213\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2213,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:09 12:47:36","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:04 13:48:58","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:04 13:48:58","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":45,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1910,"ExifImageLength":3106,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803254,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1090,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1090","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Aug 1st 1873 daughters in Europe\nAnother month and still alone, no daughters. We hear from them constantly. They are well and happy as can be but very anxious to see us all. They meet many friends from america. Our weather has not been very warm but beautiful, there is a great deal of driving on the Boulevard, the carriages and phaetons are unclear three and four abreast of afternoon. I drive down there with my boys, they on their pony and large horse, and Hunt and I in the carriage. It is very delightful to meet friends on the road and on Saturday we go over to Lincoln park. They have music, so has our south side park, but Lincoln Park has so many animals and amusements, and we like the Lake Shore drive. I dress my boys so pretty that every one admires them, and they behave so good, and are so friendly with people. They are fat and rosy. \nSept 1st, 1873\nOnly think of it how near the time is for us to meet our lovely daughters. I intend to go with Hunt and Sheridan and wait until they return at Long Branch. My sisters have returned from their trip to the seashore and will stay with Mr Badger, Shreve, and Mattie Sheridan at my house until I return. Mr Badger can't leave as he intended as Sam Walker has drawn and owes the firm of AC and OF Badger so much money that Mr Badger must watch it. He did it in Mr B. absence before so I will go on with Mr Chas Angell, Sheridan, and Hunt and meet them. \nSept 1, 1873\nWe started this afternoon for New York with Mr Chas Angell. Sheridan, Hunt and myself. We had beautiful state rooms or drawing room all the way on, everything passed of delightfully. Mr Angell very very kind, we reached New York on good time in the morning. I could scarce wait for the cars to get in. I wanted to run, and as Hunt I wanted to beat the train.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":74360,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/74360","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/1b176d85b3e876165ed0627eb40ce96b.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/1b176d85b3e876165ed0627eb40ce96b.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/1b176d85b3e876165ed0627eb40ce96b.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1b176d85b3e876165ed0627eb40ce96b.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-11T19:01:08+00:00","modified":"2020-03-18T22:20:41+00:00","filename":"1b176d85b3e876165ed0627eb40ce96b.jpg","authentication":"4bae6fa11a22d353eaf6049f8413661d","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":54,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03_059_o2.jpg","size":1212564,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2219,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.05059686545491},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["014535"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["014535"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["014535"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1b176d85b3e876165ed0627eb40ce96b.jpg","FileDateTime":1531335609,"FileSize":1212564,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2219\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2219,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:09 12:47:38","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:04 01:45:35","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:04 01:45:35","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":69,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1850,"ExifImageLength":3001,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803255,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1090,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1090","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Sept 3, 1873 Long Branch\nAs soon as we arrived Mr Angell took carriage a carriage and we all went to the depot where the Long Branch boat starts from.

Sheridan and Shreve did not think much of their breakfast. We got on the cars and reached the branch at 12 o'clock, took lunch and walked over the grounds. I had two rooms on floor above the parour, it is so late and cool that many have gone. The band of music left the day before we arrived. We went down to the edge of the Ocean and children played in sand. After dark we stayed a little while in the parlour and then went to bed. I occupied the back bed with Hunt, Sheridan had the front.\nSept 4th 1873\nWe arose early this morning took our breakfast and hurried down on the beach to get paddles in sand. Waited until 10 o'clock and saw the people bathe. Did not go in myself. Enjoyed our lunch. Went again down and piled up sand. I bought Hunt a bucket and paddle. Mr Fisher came to see me. So did Mr Angell. I wrote home today. We walked on the piazza of the other Hotels. I like Long Branch, I have been here before. \nSept 8th\nIt is raining, so I will write. We can also walk all about the long parlour and play the piano. Hunt took quite a fancy to little Ferris, he spoke such good English. We took him up in our room and had a good time of it. After lunch it cleared off and we all went out and enjoyed the sand. Saw a full rigged ship it looked superb. Sheridan took a notion to bathe, so I let him, but he only stayed in a little time and declared it was too cold. We walked out to the stores to buy baby some stockings, returned late to dinner, had a fine dinner boys are so happy.

The boats and fishing my little boys enjoyed. The lake is very pretty and clear it is nine miles round. The drives down and up on the hills is beautiful. Everywhere you turn you see the lake, many people have summer homes there. We have visited Waukegan, Lake Superior, Marquette, Green Bay, Escanaba, Riverside which is 12 miles from Chicago we spent some time at.

Eva, Hunt and myself. We had a delightful trip, all well and happy. We had a lunch with us that Mr Harvey and Belle fixed up for us. We enjoyed it. We arrived at seven in the morning, found David waiting for us. We got in his carriage and went to his house. Found my mother, father, and sister Belle and children waiting for us, all delighted to have us with them. We went right in to breakfast, and I had a chat with my mother's parrot. My mother and father look well, but quite feeble. Sister Belle looks well. Her children much grown. We stayed about ten days or nearly two weeks, received many calls from our old friends, Eva quite a Belle, she had many gentlemen to come and see her and we went to the opera often. Attended  German at Miss Dulancy's, also one at the Gault House. Received much attention. Had a call from my old minister Dr Cruik. My sister's house is so very large that it is almost impossible to warm it, so Hunt took croup and Pneumonia and for a week was very sick. Dr Heeler attended him. As soon as he was better we left our old home and took cars for home. Hunt had a cage his Aunt gave him with two white mice to bring home with him. He was a favorite with all in the cars. We were in Louisville about three weeks. The night before we left MattieFaulds gave a large young ladies party for Eva and invited several married ladies for me. We enjoyed it very much. Eva was a great belle. We arrived home on Ash Wednesday. I went to church at 10 o'clock that morning. We attended church almost every day during Lent. Weather cold and part of the time snowing. Mrs Locke ill. Octave gone to Louisville to spend two weeks with Mattie, she has a bad cold. Florence Dulancy has Typhoid fever, but she is now recovering. \nAfter Lent on Easter Sunday every one expected to appear fresh and bright in new clothes, but the day was very cold and a heavy snow storm.

My sisters paid Mrs Leiter much attention, both of them placed their carriages at her command. \nFriday March 27 1874\nFor two days Belle now Mrs Harvey, has been complaining and tonight at seven o'clock she had born a lovely little girl with black hair and perfect form. It is a nice baby, weights nine pound. Belle doing splendidly. I have been with her for several days and will stay all night. She had Br Byford as her doctor, Dr Small was out. Mr Harvey is wild with delight at it being a daughter, he published it all over the country in the papers. I think it will be called Belle, after her mother. The Harvey boys are delighted with their sister. On Easter day the baby received flowers from many friends and jewels from her father, Mr Angell, Ada, Eva, and myself. I gave her a white merino cloak, Eva a lace cap, Ada a ring and bracelet. Her Father gave her rings and Mr Angel gave her a beautiful chain and locked and she had other gifts. That night Belle was quite sick from excitement and did not get up Monday as she expected, but on Wednesday she got up for first time for 13 days. She feels well and strong, her breasts a little sore and tender from her chill and fever, but now she is better. Every day she feels stronger and better, it is hard now for met to keep her back. On Monday, which is two weeks and two days, she rode up to our house, her first ride, I scolded her for going out so soon, but her nurse Mrs Nelson said it would not hurt her, but do her good. So I said no more. Weather cold and windy. Belle is now getting so well that she rides out and receives calls, goes out shopping, and talks of going to Louisville. She received a box of beautiful gold and silver gifts from all her relations in Grandma Sheridan's family. Mrs Harvey is a great favorite with many.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":74368,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/74368","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/205816efd08517eb896b43fb96623ea6.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/205816efd08517eb896b43fb96623ea6.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/205816efd08517eb896b43fb96623ea6.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/205816efd08517eb896b43fb96623ea6.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-11T19:01:18+00:00","modified":"2020-03-23T20:35:40+00:00","filename":"205816efd08517eb896b43fb96623ea6.jpg","authentication":"5c5e64a9d4745bbd08caa9bf1bea1a15","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":62,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03_067_o2.jpg","size":1182774,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2214,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.049465271504567},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["015022"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["015022"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["015022"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"205816efd08517eb896b43fb96623ea6.jpg","FileDateTime":1531335610,"FileSize":1182774,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2214\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2214,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:09 12:47:53","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:04 01:50:22","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:04 01:50:22","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":37,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1846,"ExifImageLength":3001,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803255,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1090,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1090","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Tuesday, April 22, 1874.

At four o'clock we were all dressed and to our regret a sudden thunder shower came up, but it only lasted a moment and was all over. We had a carpet spread on our front steps, and the whole house dressed in flowers. At five all the bridesmaids and groomsmen arrived six in number, and at half past five we all got in our Carriages, two and two. Little Hunt went with me, dressed in white suit with blue boots, blue sash and blue ribbon tied on his hair, blue silk gloves. The bridesmaids were all dressed in Swiss with different coloured flowers and fans made of flowers, they were very pretty. The bride had a lovely bouquet, so did I. The street to the church was lined with carriages, the street also filled with people. An awning was up at the church door, and the church was filled with people, all our friends  came. The ceremony was very impressive, and all were so well drilled that no mistake was made and everything went off splendidly. We returned to our house and has a band of Music, and a few invited friends. Gen Sheridan was present and in a few moments we had Supper announced. Our table was beautiful in flowers and our supper fine. All marched into supper .Eva was well served and very soon left the room to be dressed for her Journey. Her traveling suit was brown silk and cloth, she looked very handsome. Sheridan prepared her a lunch and the happy pair went off with their servant Joe Miller as attendant. Our friends remained until ten, and some danced. My new girl Agnshis came this afternoon (a coloured girl). Eva looked so beautiful and seemed so happy. She is truly one gifted as well as lovely. She has no faults, it is rare to meet one like her, she is such a sunbeam and yet so much power and strength, few are like her.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":74381,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/74381","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/8e15bd0bc6cc91dcb42396c49b46dd36.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/8e15bd0bc6cc91dcb42396c49b46dd36.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/8e15bd0bc6cc91dcb42396c49b46dd36.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/8e15bd0bc6cc91dcb42396c49b46dd36.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-11T19:01:32+00:00","modified":"2020-03-24T17:21:56+00:00","filename":"8e15bd0bc6cc91dcb42396c49b46dd36.jpg","authentication":"7e4090fb01c0c38d1910fc3ebdd941c7","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":75,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03_082_o2.jpg","size":918869,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2211,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.038480535035261},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["135546"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["135546"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["135546"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"8e15bd0bc6cc91dcb42396c49b46dd36.jpg","FileDateTime":1531335611,"FileSize":918869,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2211\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2211,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:09 12:48:21","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:04 13:55:46","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:04 13:55:46","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":44,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1917,"ExifImageLength":3121,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803254,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1090,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1090","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Friday June 5th 1874\nDay after the wedding\nThis has been a beautiful sunny day but we all feel sad and miss our bright laughing Eva.

They are both of them out of health. At eight o'clock we all left the Hotel in two Carriages and reached the Depot in good time. Mr Nordheimer was on the train going to Niagara. \nFriday July 17th 1874\nThis morning we arrived at Boston at seven o'clock. I spent a very pleasant night in the Cars. Hunt slept well. We got out of the Cars and took our breakfast in the Restaurant in the Depot. At eight we started for Yarmouth Cape Cod Bay, Dennis Station. We travelled in the Cars for near five hours and reached the station at 12 o'clock. Three Carriages were waiting and they drove up to the Hotel, it is about an hours ride from the station making six miles. When we arrived they were glad to see us, as our rooms had been waiting for a week for us. Dr Hulse has a room next to mine, the Hotel stands alone near the Ocean, no house near it, but quite a good size village around it. There are only a few borders in our house, everything is very nice, the landlord and lady are very kind and gave us a very nice dinner, I shall write today to Mr Badger in Chicago. \nSaturday July 18 1874\nI wrote home today. I have been twice to the beach. Today with Hunt, all of us well, we retired early tonight, all of us tired. This seaside place is situated on a high elevation of ground it commands a good view of the bay and one or two towns are in view, it is cool and delightful, yet still warm. The Hotel is only one year old, it is kept by Mr Lufkins, his wife and Granddaugther are the principal ones who take charge. Everything is new and nice, we have eight nice rooms all together. There are only a few people in the house, so we have good attention.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":74394,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/74394","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/b0ca7e6f3d70c0de0b9da1644a6940f4.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/b0ca7e6f3d70c0de0b9da1644a6940f4.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/b0ca7e6f3d70c0de0b9da1644a6940f4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/b0ca7e6f3d70c0de0b9da1644a6940f4.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-11T19:01:47+00:00","modified":"2020-03-27T16:48:50+00:00","filename":"b0ca7e6f3d70c0de0b9da1644a6940f4.jpg","authentication":"e3ef95dbd604041978569a1a4510dd48","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":88,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03_095_o2.jpg","size":995629,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2208,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041751752885132},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["015353"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["015353"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["015353"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"b0ca7e6f3d70c0de0b9da1644a6940f4.jpg","FileDateTime":1531335611,"FileSize":995629,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2208\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2208,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:09 12:48:45","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.033333333333333,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:04 01:53:53","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:04 01:53:53","ShutterSpeedValue":4.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1841,"ExifImageLength":3001,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803255,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1090,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1090","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Sunday July 19 1874\nToday is beautiful and sunny - we are all in good health, eat a hearty breakfast and all went down to the Shore and spent sometime, then we returned to the Hotel and took dinner with Ice Cream.

I received a letter from Lake Forest from my daughter, she reports everything beautiful and all well. After tea we went into the parlous and had Dancing until ten or eleven. It still rains, we all well and happy.\nSunday Aug 9th 1874\nIt rained all night and is raining now at ten o'clock, so I suppose we will have to stay in doors, which is very hard when there is so much to attract one out. I think Dr Hulse will lecture this afternoon, all of us well. I will write home today. It is now three o'clock and the rain has ceased. Several gentlemen came from Denniss and so did five or six ladies to hear Dr Hulse, his lecture was fine. After tea we sang Hymns in the parlour then Dr came to my room and lectured to my sister on medicine.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":74401,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/74401","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/cb76fa43987f8ecad23aec6c9f5228a4.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/cb76fa43987f8ecad23aec6c9f5228a4.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/cb76fa43987f8ecad23aec6c9f5228a4.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/cb76fa43987f8ecad23aec6c9f5228a4.jpg"},"added":"2018-07-11T19:01:55+00:00","modified":"2020-03-30T16:25:36+00:00","filename":"cb76fa43987f8ecad23aec6c9f5228a4.jpg","authentication":"1a85ae62e7f6552dbb87fa06d558046f","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":95,"original_filename":"mms_badger_box_01_fl_03_102_o2.jpg","size":993727,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2244,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.041003457780419},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["135803"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["135803"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20180104"],"TimeCreated":["135803"],"Credit":["808002"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"cb76fa43987f8ecad23aec6c9f5228a4.jpg","FileDateTime":1531335612,"FileSize":993727,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2244\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2244,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"12mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:01:09 12:48:58","Exif_IFD_Pointer":156},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":250,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2018:01:04 13:58:03","DateTimeDigitized":"2018:01:04 13:58:03","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":61,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1941,"ExifImageLength":3113,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":4051803254,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1090,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1090","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"Monday Aug 10, 1874\nIt poured rain all night and this morning the sun is shining brightly, and everything is drying up.

Much to my deep regret I received the news of the death of Bishop Whitehouse of Chicago Illinois, he was a great man and a good Christian. His loss will be deeply felt, far and near. News from home say that Octavius has hurt his spine from too much rowing while at Fruitport. Tonight the wind has changed and a light fog has come up and it rains, it has taken off all the Mosquitoes. Today we had quite an excitement, some men came and walked into our Landlady's room and took all her Gin Whiskey and wines, it being against the law to sell liquor and he had done it at his own Bar. Tonight David went down with Mr Lufkin to try and fix it, but it being against the law, I think he will have to pay one hundred dollars. This afternoon Dr Hulse lectured to some people who called on Mr Lufkin. It rains so no one can play croquet, we went in the parlous and danced. At noon Mrs Westcott left for Boston. Mrs R.J. Ward of Louisville died some days ago. I had letter from Eva and Ada as well. \nSaturday Aug 15, 1874\nA little cloudy and cool we are all well. Received a letter from home. After breakfast Siss with David Adele and Mattie Faulds all went to Yarmouth did not return until late in the evening.

Eva Lufkin was excellent as the Housekeeper. \nSunday Aug 16\nA beautiful day, I went out to walk, it was beautiful all of us well. Several people from the Village came to hear Dr Hulse lecture, he talked also in the evening.

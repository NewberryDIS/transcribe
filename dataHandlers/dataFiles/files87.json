Yesterday afternoon Miss Jencks and I took a pleasure walk, my first I think in Norfolk. I have had many pleasant ones before, however I enjoyed this one exceedingly. We went on Free Mason St. one of the pleasantest and widest in the city leading westward to the Elisabeth River. The sun was low and cast a lovely glow on the water. Across the river was Portsmouth where stood the marine hospital, a cool, roomy looking place; and out a little way in the water a light-house, many cornered, heavy looking, apparently able to breast many winds. Between us and Portsmouth anchored the New Hampshire on board which a marshall band was filling the air all about\nNow my dear what think you of my surroundings?

We had been looking for a letter for a long time, every night we thought we surly would get one that night but no, no letter came. You were not very well I fear. Mary will have to be very careful or she will be sick again. Miss Colagrove? finished a dress she was making for Sarah to night.  Cousin Elizabeth tried it on, it looked quite pretty. We have not heard from Sarah for some time,  but hope to soon.  Do please to forgive me for not answering your last note.  I have no excuse to give at all.  But I hope to be more punctual in answering your letters after this.  I can not see how I could let you stay there so long before I wrote one word.  Only think of it, Jane was gone almost a year and I did not even write one little note to her.  Jane appeared to be quite anxious we should study french, we have been trying to study it a little but did not make much headway at it though.  Edward Josiah says he will write as soon as he finds time.  He wants me to tell Jane \"they have to work hard all day from morning till night.  He has to set from a page and a half to ? pages a day.\"  The Cenhadwr  is just coming out and they have quite a busy time of it.  We had two weddings here last night.  A man by the name of Smith came first they came a little before six, we had not quite finished our supper.  They came rather sooner than we expected.  They did not stay but a very short time, just long enough to get tied together.

Thank you much for your letter which I received last Saturday night.  It was dated Oct 27.  I think we can appreciate, in a measure your letters.  They are more than common messages of love, for they are written in sickness, in weakness, when the use of the pen must cause some exertion -- We have reason to thank the Lord, that though he has brought you so low in weak and apparently so near the brink of the \"dark river\" he has yet spared your lives.  And he will, I trust strengthen you and once more, let you bathe in the river of health.  Dear ones all, how often the wish comes to us, that we could be with you and could comfort you and assist you a little -- I hope you have received that box ere this, I suppose Mary will tell you when it was sent.  It will do you no good for me to write surmises of how you are, and what you are doing, for you already know all about that.  But you have, I suppose no Oracle, who tells you how your home friends are occupied so perhaps a little news of them would be as acceptable as any thing I could write.  I say home friends which seems most like home to you, Remsen, or Kansas?  The Mountain Parsonage or your \"Snug House\"?  The \"home is where the heart is.\"  And though perhaps you each have your dearest friend by your side,sharing in  all your troubles, still do not your thoughts sometimes travel here?  Are not your hears or the love of your hearts often with us?  Why what is the matter with me?  I am asking you questions, instead of telling you of us.  Well, we often let our thoughts travel to you and sometimes suffer our imagination to picture your forms and home but we do not like to have it bring your sufferings before our eyes.  But then, when you write tell us just how you are.  I feel that we cannot indeed understand what you suffer.

Last Sat. she and R. came home, and she is staying with us now, and our Sarah, once our sick Sarah has gone down with Robert in his buggy.  She may stay with him two or three weeks or only one.  She has a good many friends around Utica whom she wants to visit. -- Tomorrow, I expect there will be a great slaughter around our way.  We expect Griffith Griffiths Llanllowen to come to our house to butcher.  Do not tremble now, and think he is going to slaughter in the house and your Pa and Ma and brothers and sisters lives will be in danger for he is one of those men who make a great distinction between the lives of the human and brute creation.  We hear frequently from Jennie and occasionly from Elisabeth.  They both seem to be well and happy, and anxiously inquiring for you.  Jennie says she has written to you twice and hopes to get  her reward sometime.  I do not know as she said she had written to you Sarah, but to one or both of you I guess.  I have not got her letter before me now.  I have written her copies of two of your letters  (when I say you I mean either of you) She said she would like to have me send her copies sometimes for now you are sick she did not like to ask you to write to her.  She seems to be particularly pleased with her situation, the people around here and most everything she mentions.  I received a letter last week from cousin Lizzie.  She wrote that she felt so sorry for you, and asked me to give you her love when I wrote to you.  She intends to come this way next Summer.  You have written to us that you gave wrong directions as to sending letters Tuesday but as we have not answered your letter before Monday night, I suppose it will do as well to send it to morrow, as to keep it longer.  Mary seems not.  Ah she is busy now, I was going to not doing much or something, so Lewis has been after a big load of tanbark and is now eating his supper together with Rev. Mr. Samuel who is staying with us to night, on our kitchen table, by which we (Anna and myself) are also writing.  Mary is sitting by, waiting on the eaters.  The table is drawn up to the stove.  The stove is not now in the chimney but in its winter station, among folks.  Now have you some idea how we look -- Lewis looks at my writing and says \"I hope the chills haven't affected his eyes.\"  I hope so too.  Indeed the table folks seem to be so witty in their remarks, that if my sheet were not so near full, I do not know but I would adopt a new mode of making a letter and tell you what they say.  But you must try to content yourself with my original scribbling this time, and I will deliver my sheet over to Mary to receive from her a few finishing touches.

The next morning Lettie went with me to Church and I went with Father to Mr. Howell's to dinner.  There I met Mrs. Evans' sister to David Roberts ( Warner L Ray)  She went with me to Church in the afternoon.  After meeting I started alone for cousin Mary's.  I went on almost at a ventur till I came to where I could go several different ways.  I saw a lady standing on the piazza of a house, whom I thought I had seen in meeting so I crossed over and asked her which was Genesee St.  She said \"there, where those ladies are going up\" (It was raining, so ther were not a great many ladies.)  I asked if I could find Court St. by going that way and she said she was going to Ct. St. as soon as the rain abated a little, so I waited, and pretty soon, Margaret Williams and Elisabeth Charles came up.  The lady of the house (a Mrs. Jones) invited us in and in we went and were soon seated.  The rain meantime came down faster and faster.  I do not think I had seen it rain so hard more than once and I am not sure it did then.  Why the water was soon dashing in torrents down the sides of the streets, almost as furiously as it does at the \"falls\".  We staid there, I should think over half an hour and then proceeded on our way.  With the lady's company (who I found had relatives about Remsen and was intending to come up to the meeting) I had no trouble in finding Mary's.  Father came up after tea to say that he would not try to come home that day on account off the rain.  I was tired, and didn't go to meeting that evening.  Father came for me early the next morning and we went to Floyd.  We We got much chilled riding, but you nicely warmed at Mrs. Thomas'.  Mrs. R. is quite smart now.

I suppose of course you are interested in our National Struggle. I have so little space left that I can only allude to it. It has been fearful and bloody, but we hope soon to see its end - and we confidently expect it will result in the fulfillment of our long, long, long indulged wish, and most fervent prayer that the foul system of slavery shall cease to defile our fair country.

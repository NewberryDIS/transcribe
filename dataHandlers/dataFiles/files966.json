order to take this money from us, they have ordered that we must pay a duty upon this and that thing that we are accustomed to purchase, which is as much as to say, that upon those things which we purchase we must pay to the Great King against our consent a sum of money above the real value of those things.  And in particular they ordered, that if we drink Tea, we must pay so much money to the Great King.___  I must tell you, this Tea is somewhat like your black drink.__ But as we know that this order is contrary to our agreement; and also, as we know the evil consequences of our paying this money so your Brother the White people in america have resolved that they will not pay it; and therefore the Men about the Great King have persuaded him to send Soldiers to Boston, and we are told some are coming here to force the People to give their money without their consent; and thereby to give up their rights and privileges which are mentioned in the agreement.\nSome foolish People say it is better to pay this money for the Tea, than to go to War about it.  But I tell you, it is not about this money alone that we quarrel, for the money itself we do not regard as two corn stalks; but, we are afraid bad consequences will follow if we pay the money, as I will shew to you directly.\nWe find that the Men in England talk among themselves that they intend to make us in america pay to them a great sum of money every year.  The way they intend to raise this money is as I have told you already by making us pay a duty upon this and that thing that we are accustomed to purchase.  Now this duty upon Tea brings in but a very small part of that great sum of money they want to make us pay to them; and therefore, we refuse to pay this money","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":61701,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/61701","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/1fa828a8949c5fb041bd1307220e2779.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/1fa828a8949c5fb041bd1307220e2779.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/1fa828a8949c5fb041bd1307220e2779.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/1fa828a8949c5fb041bd1307220e2779.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-20T14:11:02+00:00","modified":"2019-11-20T22:20:04+00:00","filename":"1fa828a8949c5fb041bd1307220e2779.jpg","authentication":"2b195d6b7657abcbeb357f6ff3e6dbc9","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_255_00005_o2.jpg","size":1229588,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2248,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.0506453473046},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120501"],"TimeCreated":["113525+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120501"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120501"],"TimeCreated":["113525+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120501"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120501"],"TimeCreated":["113525+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120501"],"By-line":["Luna Imaging"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"1fa828a8949c5fb041bd1307220e2779.jpg","FileDateTime":1521555057,"FileSize":1229588,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2248\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2248,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS5 Macintosh","DateTime":"2012:05:09 10:49:37","Artist":"Luna Imaging","Exif_IFD_Pointer":180},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:05:01 11:35:25","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:05:01 11:35:25","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":0,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":6,"SubSecTimeDigitized":6,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2456,"ExifImageLength":3933,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3957.7167019027,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3961.9047619048,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA430":"Luna Imaging","UndefinedTag:0xA431":620549,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":966,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/966","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"for the Tea, least, if we paid it, they would be encouraged to go on time after time, to lay duties upon a great many other things, which we are accustomed to purchase; in order that they may at last get from us, that great Sum of Money which they want, and which perhaps is all we have.

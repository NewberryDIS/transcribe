Myrt Holloway spanked Varnarsdale. Got home before 12. \nOctober 10th. Thursday.\nBessie Tongate came to school with Lillie. Children fairly tried themselves. Sang \"Gathered Now.\" Was much disheartened. After school was out lay down in the seat and rested. Most everyone failed to know the lesson. It is eight o'clock I am going to bed. This evening I sent schedule and a note to Mr. King.","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":8057,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/8057","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/94e823fc357547ee4e81ffdaeb4df31d.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/94e823fc357547ee4e81ffdaeb4df31d.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/94e823fc357547ee4e81ffdaeb4df31d.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/94e823fc357547ee4e81ffdaeb4df31d.jpg"},"added":"2017-08-14T21:59:43+00:00","modified":"2019-10-15T00:09:56+00:00","filename":"94e823fc357547ee4e81ffdaeb4df31d.jpg","authentication":"f7bc9c21834446d9e3512d0a3c7d6fa8","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":22,"original_filename":"mms_221_fl_03_022_o2.jpg","size":1405809,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":2936,"resolution_y":3600,"compression_ratio":0.044334979564033},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20161005"],"TimeCreated":["041132+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20161005"],"TimeCreated":["041132+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20161005"],"TimeCreated":["041132+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"94e823fc357547ee4e81ffdaeb4df31d.jpg","FileDateTime":1502747920,"FileSize":1405809,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"2936\" height=\"3600\"","Height":3600,"Width":2936,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"15mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/10.0"},"IFD0":{"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","Software":"Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Windows)","DateTime":"2016:10:06 15:47:38","Exif_IFD_Pointer":152},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.04,"FNumber":10,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":400,"UndefinedTag:0x8830":2,"UndefinedTag:0x8832":400,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2016:10:05 04:11:32","DateTimeDigitized":"2016:10:05 04:11:32","ShutterSpeedValue":4.643856,"ApertureValue":6.643856,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":3,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":42,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":2514,"ExifImageLength":3082,"FocalPlaneXResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneYResolution":1600,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":3,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":358023000687,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["28\/1","75\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"28-75mm","UndefinedTag:0xA435":0}}}},"item":{"id":36,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/36","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"October 11th Friday.\nPretty in morning.

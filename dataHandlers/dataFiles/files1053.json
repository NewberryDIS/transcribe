He took the end of the deer's tongue between the thumb & finger of one hand, and seven kernels of corn, from the seven ears in the other hand, and held them up as a thank offering to God.  He then repeated a form of thanksgiving and prayer, handed down from generation to generation.  This form was not to be altered or laid aside.  In this, the priest gave thanks for the fruits of the earth which had been brought forward, and which they had been permitted to see.  He prayed also that the lord would bless the corn and meat during the year, and make them healthful and nourishing food; and also bless and take care of them during their future years.\nHaving concluded his thanksgiving and prayer, the priest put the meat and corn on the fire, and then sprinkled on a powder of old tobacco leaves.  The priest, - his right hand man, and seven counsellors payed strict attention to the burning of the meat.  If the smoke ascended directly, and the meat burnt in a still quiet manner, or threw small pieces in a certain direction, all would be well.  But if the smoke settled over the altar, forming a bluish cloud, and the meat popped, throwing pieces toward the west, it was to be a sickly year.\nThe sacrifice being ended, the priests right hand man ordered the victuals, (previously prepared) to be brought forward, and placed in such a manner that all might sit by it, and be ready to eat when directed.  The right hand man then gave orders for eating and all commenced the same instant to partake of the new food.  The priest, however, his right hand man and seven counsellors, ate nothing till after sunset, nor then of new fruit.  That night also must be spent in entire wakefulness, and wholly occupied in a religious dance performed by women.\nAs observed above, the priest, and his right hand man and seven counsellors, did not partake of the green fruit at this time.

That is, they considered themselves so.  Second, they introduce into the ceremonies of this feast, the prayers for cleansing from all the impurities of the year past, which has no necessary connection with this feast.  Third, the washings, introduced here properly belong to the latter feast.  \nThere was another method of celebrating the feast of first fruits, more modern than either of the foregoing and yet more ancient than the present.  This was doubtless, introduced to avoid the evil and inconveniences of assembling the whole nation at one place.  The national council authorised each town to hold the feast separately, and instructed the messenger of each town priest, with the care of regulating it.\nSoon after the national council, each town priest called a town council, at which his messenger made known to the people all the arts of the national council.  That is, he brought forward the tobacco and the stick of beads the great speaker had given him, and while the town chiefs were smoking the tobacco, he related the general doings of the council, and among other things, the authority he had received to hold the green corn feast in their own town.  He then selected a man to order the green corn feast, and make all necessary arrangements, giving the man special notice of his appointment.

Seven nights previous, they called an assembly at the council house.  They then directed all the hunters in the town to devote the six intervening days to hunting.

The signification of this word, is not easily ascertained.  It implies that communion the Indians enter into on certain occasions.  Thus, when two young men conceived a peculiar fondness for each other, they entered into a state of perpetual brotherhood, if I may so call this relation, which cannot be expressed by any word in our language.  They put on their best clothing, and met by mutual agreement, at a time & place appointed.  Without much conversation, one took off a certain garment and gave to his friend.  In this he was immediately imitated by the other.  Another garment was then exchanged, and another, until there was an entire inter change of clothing.  Thus each one gave himself to the other and was clothed by the other, & were of course one.  This relation embraced all that is implied in peace, reconciliation, friendship, and brotherhood, and much more than either or all of those terms.  When two were thus giving themselves to each other, and entering into that closest connexion, it was said of them A na to no ka, and the relation thus formed was termed A to hu no.  So the feast under consideration was termed A to hu no and may we not suppose that this word, whatever its precise meaning may be, is designed to express an idea something similar to expiation, reconciliation or atonement.

In case the priest who sung the yo wa, at this feast had died during the past year, the counsellors selected another to fill his place, who held the office during life.  \nAll appointments being made, they retired, and the next morning the priest, his right hand man, seven counsellors, and seven women, one of each clan, commenced fasting; and during the six days previous to the commencement of the feast, ate only once in twenty four hours, and then nothing but light food.  Their time of eating was a little after dark. \nThe hunters, at the same time commenced their labours; and the first buck they shot down, the chief hunter approached, and taking hold of the tongue, before touching the buck in any other front, cut off a piece from the end of the right side and wrapped it up in leaves, for sacrifice.  The man who shot the buck, then took off the skin, and barbicued the meat, which, together with the skin, and the skins of all the deer killed on the occasion, belonged to the priest, and were delivered to","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70578,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70578","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/2b754afae9f80ab19e0a713b952f2548.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/2b754afae9f80ab19e0a713b952f2548.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/2b754afae9f80ab19e0a713b952f2548.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/2b754afae9f80ab19e0a713b952f2548.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:37:32+00:00","modified":"2020-03-28T19:57:02+00:00","filename":"2b754afae9f80ab19e0a713b952f2548.jpg","authentication":"a37f845ba8f93846f68a9c4de9b9d0d3","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL009_00018_o2 copy.jpg","size":559052,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2325,"compression_ratio":0.044528235762644},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["001703+0000"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":[""],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["001703+0000"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0000"],"DateCreated":["20000117"],"TimeCreated":["001703+0000"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"2b754afae9f80ab19e0a713b952f2548.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424231,"FileSize":559052,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2325\"","Height":2325,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":1,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2325,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:10:18","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":930,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":6800},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":221,"DateTimeOriginal":"2000:01:17 00:17:03","DateTimeDigitized":"2000:01:17 00:17:03","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTime":96,"SubSecTimeOriginal":96,"SubSecTimeDigitized":96,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2325,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021502289,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1053,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1053","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"324 penciled at top of page - also 28\nhis right hand man on the return of the hunters.

As the decoction used at this annual feast, was considered a water of purification, which, together with the various washings observed at the time, as well as prayers and sacrifices purified them from all former filthiness, they would naturally think of this feast, or fast, as proper to be observed in order to purify themselves and turn away any divine judgment which they feared.  But when the yo wa was sung, and the various ceremonies for purification, observed, on some special occasion to prevent sickness, the priest was not in all respects, the same, as the ancient A to hu na, and was distinguished by another name, vir. the Physic dance.

The two forward men carried in their right hands, a hoop, with two sticks put through it crossing each other at right angles in the centre.  On the ends of these sticks were fastened white feathers.

A sister mourning for her brother.  In the evening they set up a most piteous cry, or rather wailing, which continued with some little cessation, during the night.  The sister would repeat, times without number, \"Come my brother, I shall see you no more forever.\"  The night was extremely cold.  About sunrise next morning, preparation was made for performing the ceremony of cutting their flesh in order to give relief to their grief of mind.  The snow was removed from the frozen ground over about as large a space as would be required to place a small Indian lodge.  In the centre a very small fire was kindled up, not to give warmth, apparently, but to make a smoke.  The sister who was the chief mourner, came out of her lodge, followed by three other women, who repaired to the place prepared.  They were all barefooted, and nearly naked.  Here they set up a most bitter lamentation, and crying mingling the wailings with the words above mentioned.  The\n________________\nJews side\nAs soon as a person dies, the females in the family with a low voice, set up a sorrowful cry.  They continue it as long as they can without taking breath, and the first shriek of wailing dies away in a low sob.  After a short space of time they repeat the same cry, and continue it for eight days.  Every day, however, it becomes less and less frequent. Until the corpse is carried away from the house, the women who are related to the deceased sit on the ground together in an circle, in a separate apartment.  The nearest relative occupies the centre, and each one holds a napkin in her hand.  On a signal from the nearest relative, - the females arose, and wrapping together their napkins, ran like mad persons; but the nearest relative kept her position, tearing her hair, and wounding her face arms and breast with her nails.\nIndications of grief were rending the garment to","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":52,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/52","name":"Transcription","resource":"elements"}}],"extended_resources":[]},{"id":70597,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/files\/70597","file_urls":{"original":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/original\/6ebdbde72d9c3d0a3d9df80a2c61b297.jpg","fullsize":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/fullsize\/6ebdbde72d9c3d0a3d9df80a2c61b297.jpg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/thumbnails\/6ebdbde72d9c3d0a3d9df80a2c61b297.jpg","square_thumbnail":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/files\/square_thumbnails\/6ebdbde72d9c3d0a3d9df80a2c61b297.jpg"},"added":"2018-03-30T15:37:46+00:00","modified":"2020-03-31T00:15:44+00:00","filename":"6ebdbde72d9c3d0a3d9df80a2c61b297.jpg","authentication":"a5e63864aa6218b43daa0de367f465ce","has_derivative_image":true,"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","order":null,"original_filename":"Ayer_MS_689_VL04_FL010_00004_o2.jpg","size":575193,"stored":true,"type_os":"JPEG image data, EXIF standard","metadata":{"mime_type":"image\/jpeg","video":{"dataformat":"jpg","lossless":false,"bits_per_sample":24,"pixel_aspect_ratio":1,"resolution_x":1800,"resolution_y":2249,"compression_ratio":0.047362037448743},"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["115754+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"comments_html":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["115754+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"iptc":{"comments":{"IPTCEnvelope":{"CodedCharacterSet":["\u001b%G"]},"IPTCApplication":{"ApplicationRecordVersion":["\u0000\u0004"],"DateCreated":["20120619"],"TimeCreated":["115754+0000"],"DigitalCreationDate":["20120619"]}},"encoding":"ISO-8859-1"},"jpg":{"exif":{"FILE":{"FileName":"6ebdbde72d9c3d0a3d9df80a2c61b297.jpg","FileDateTime":1522424232,"FileSize":575193,"FileType":2,"MimeType":"image\/jpeg","SectionsFound":"ANY_TAG, IFD0, THUMBNAIL, EXIF"},"COMPUTED":{"html":"width=\"1800\" height=\"2249\"","Height":2249,"Width":1800,"IsColor":1,"ByteOrderMotorola":0,"CCDWidth":"11mm","ApertureFNumber":"f\/7.1","Thumbnail.FileType":2,"Thumbnail.MimeType":"image\/jpeg"},"IFD0":{"ImageWidth":3600,"ImageLength":2249,"BitsPerSample":[8,8,8],"PhotometricInterpretation":2,"Make":"Canon","Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark II","Orientation":1,"SamplesPerPixel":3,"XResolution":300,"YResolution":300,"ResolutionUnit":2,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop CC 2017 (Windows)","DateTime":"2018:03:29 15:10:27","Exif_IFD_Pointer":288},"THUMBNAIL":{"Compression":6,"XResolution":72,"YResolution":72,"ResolutionUnit":2,"JPEGInterchangeFormat":918,"JPEGInterchangeFormatLength":5073},"EXIF":{"ExposureTime":0.016666666666667,"FNumber":7.1,"ExposureProgram":1,"ISOSpeedRatings":200,"ExifVersion":230,"DateTimeOriginal":"2012:06:19 11:57:54","DateTimeDigitized":"2012:06:19 11:57:54","ShutterSpeedValue":5.906891,"ApertureValue":5.655638,"ExposureBiasValue":0,"MaxApertureValue":2.625,"MeteringMode":5,"Flash":16,"FocalLength":50,"SubSecTimeOriginal":13,"SubSecTimeDigitized":13,"ColorSpace":65535,"ExifImageWidth":1800,"ExifImageLength":2249,"FocalPlaneXResolution":3849.2117888965,"FocalPlaneYResolution":3908.1419624217,"FocalPlaneResolutionUnit":2,"CustomRendered":0,"ExposureMode":1,"WhiteBalance":1,"SceneCaptureType":0,"UndefinedTag:0xA431":3021505797,"UndefinedTag:0xA432":["50\/1","50\/1","0\/0","0\/0"],"UndefinedTag:0xA434":"EF50mm f\/2.5 Compact Macro"}}}},"item":{"id":1053,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/items\/1053","resource":"items"},"element_texts":[{"html":false,"text":"Completed","element_set":{"id":4,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/element_sets\/4","name":"Scripto","resource":"element_sets"},"element":{"id":53,"url":"http:\/\/publications.newberry.org\/transcription\/mms-transcribe\/api\/elements\/53","name":"Status","resource":"elements"}},{"html":false,"text":"345 penciled at top of page.

Sometimes they put the shallow earthen pan on coals, & baked their cakes on that.  Again they mixed their bread in a large shallow round basket.  This would be perhaps two feet in diameter.  The bottom of this being covered with dough two or three inches thick.  The dough on the top was made smooth, and covered with cucumber leaves.  Then the basket was turned bottom upwards on the hot clay or stone, and taken off leaving the loaf lying on the leaves.  This was then covered with leaves, and afterwards with ashes and coals.  in this manner they made loaves as large as they pleased.  \nThey made great use of parched corn meal.

At the first appearance of that moon the people assembled at the house of the principal priest (or conjurer, as the following ceremonies are now practised) who was on this occasion attended by two right hand men, subject to his orders.  One of these assistants selected seven men to sing for the women.  When the first singer takes his seat, & commences singing, the women commence a slow walk round the fire, the foremost having tarapin shells, with pebbles in them ties to the calves of their legs.  When the first singer had concluded, as he did in about three quarters of an hour, he stopped, & retired.  The women then rested till the second took his seat, - proceeded as the first etc till all the seven had completed their music, & then all retired to rest.  \nIn the morning before sunrise, the priest collected all into a house, and seated them in rows, with their faces to the east.

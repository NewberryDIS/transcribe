Yet it so happened, that one day, when all appeared quiet at, and about this Village, I had taken a walk to Mr. Robbin's house, where the brethren Young and Edwards were lodged; when, while there, the Scalp Yell was sounded, at one and the same time, in two opposite directions; and both war parties could, owing to the very high situation of the spot the House was on, be plainly seen coming on with their Prisoners and Scalps, tho yet at a great distance, both Parties having Prairie ground to travel on. Having asked Mr. Robbin's opinion, which would be the best for me to do, to go straight way home to my quarters, or wait untill the storm was over, he advised the first.

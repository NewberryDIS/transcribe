                "text": "One of two journals kept by Mrs. Rowley about the city of Chicago and its environs. The first journal, from 1851, describes the death of a family member, Aldric, who had gone to California (possibly Mrs. Rowley’s husband). The second journal spans 1857-1887 and describes farming life, weather, multiple marriages and funerals, and family and social gatherings at home and at Hoards Hall, Unity Church, and camp meetings. Frequent trips to Chicago and other nearby towns including Leyden, Ridgeland, Harlem, and Maywood are described, along with an extended trip to Mrs. Rowley’s childhood home of Shelburn (now Shelburne), Vermont. As the journal progresses, Mrs. Rowley enters her 60s and 70s and begins to write repeatedly after family gatherings and holidays that the whole family may not be together for the next gathering. <br /><a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Rowley.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a> | <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/mms_096\">View in digital collection</a>",

                "text": "One of two journals kept by Mrs. Rowley about the city of Chicago and its environs. The first journal, from 1851, describes the death of a family member, Aldric, who had gone to California (possibly Mrs. Rowley’s husband). The second journal spans 1857-1887 and describes farming life, weather, multiple marriages and funerals, and family and social gatherings at home and at Hoards Hall, Unity Church, and camp meetings. Frequent trips to Chicago and other nearby towns including Leyden, Ridgeland, Harlem, and Maywood are described, along with an extended trip to Mrs. Rowley’s childhood home of Shelburn (now Shelburne), Vermont. As the journal progresses, Mrs. Rowley enters her 60s and 70s and begins to write repeatedly after family gatherings and holidays that the whole family may not be together for the next gathering. <br /><a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Rowley.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a> | <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/mms_096\">View in digital collection</a>",

The family was living in Brooklyn, New York, when Isaac decided to move them to the Middle West, where his sister Abigail and her husband Charles Cleveland were already settled. In 1841 and 1842, teenager Mary Sackett kept a lively, detailed journal of the journey from New York City to Laona, a small town in Winnebago County, Illinois. In 1847, when Mary Sackett was twenty-one, she married Hanson C. Pierson, who died a year later. In 1852 she married Samuel Chapman with whom she had six children. Little else is known about Sackett’s adult life, and she died at age forty-three in 1869. This journal was kept by Mary Sackett when she and her family emigrated from New York state to Laona, Winnebago County, Illinois in 1841-1842. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Sackett.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a> | <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/mms_038\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View in digital collection</a>",

                "text": "Mary Hartwell Catherwood was born in Ohio in 1847. After spending most of her life in the small Midwestern towns where her husband's business took her and her daughter, at the end of her life she settled in Chicago, where she died in 1902. Catherwood was a central figure in Middle Western authorship during the 1880s and 1890s, writing historical romances, both short stories and novels. Many of her regional, local-color tales reflect life in the corn-belt towns of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois, as well as the French traditions along the American-Canadian border. Yet she also employed historical settings such as Colonial Arcadia and 19th century Mackinac Island. Both well-educated and ambitious, Catherwood had a successful writing career, publishing consistently in magazines of the period, such as Lippincott's Magazine, Harper's Magazine and Atlantic Monthly, as well as in several periodicals for young people. The popularity of Catherwood's sentimental, romantic style and subject matter waned with the advent of a new realism in literature after the turn of the twentieth century, but her regional short stories are of interest for their rich local color and details of speech, manners, emotions and incidents of the times. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Catherwood.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a> | <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://archive.org/details/mms_catherwood_box_001/page/n349\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View in digital collection</a>",

Printing, education, pioneer life, and religion are all discussed within the letters. Included are the papers of Robert Everett, the pastor of Welsh Congregationalist churches in Oneida County, New York, and publisher of Y Cenhadwr Americanaidd (The American Missionary), a Welsh religious reform magazine that was pro-abolition. Also included are letters and materials of Mary Everett, a graduate of New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, who was also involved in the suffrage movement, John Roberts and Sarah Colgrove Everett, pioneers who moved to Kansas Territory in 1854 and were active in abolitionist activities, and Cynthia Everett, a member of the American Missionary Association who taught freedmen in Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina, following the Civil War. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Everett.xml#series2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a><br /><br />Cynthia Everett (1839-1876) initially taught school in and around Remsen. In 1870 she went to Norfolk, VA and then Charleston, SC, with the American Missionary Association to teach freedmen. She remained there only a short time before becoming ill and returning to Remsen, but her letters home are filled with descriptions and anecdotes about her students, coworkers, and other details about the experience. Her strong anti-slavery stance is apparent. Many of Cynthia's students and colleagues wrote to her after she left the south; these letters are included in the incoming correspondence.",

Printing, education, pioneer life, and religion are all discussed within the letters. Included are the papers of Robert Everett, the pastor of Welsh Congregationalist churches in Oneida County, New York, and publisher of Y Cenhadwr Americanaidd (The American Missionary), a Welsh religious reform magazine that was pro-abolition. Also included are letters and materials of Mary Everett, a graduate of New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, who was also involved in the suffrage movement, John Roberts and Sarah Colgrove Everett, pioneers who moved to Kansas Territory in 1854 and were active in abolitionist activities, and Cynthia Everett, a member of the American Missionary Association who taught freedmen in Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina, following the Civil War. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Everett.xml#sum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide </a><br /><br />Mary Everett (1830-1916) initially taught school, and later attended the New York Medical College and Hospital for women. After graduating in 1872 she opened a homeopathic practice in New York City. She was one of the first female surgeons in the United States, and active in temperance and women's rights movements form the 1860s until her death in 1916. Her letters to family describe coursework, cases, and often include medical advice and prescriptions. Some of her incoming correspondence is from other female colleagues, as well as other homeopathic physicians with whom she traded advice. Included here are her medical school notes.",

Printing, education, pioneer life, and religion are all discussed within the letters. Included are the papers of Robert Everett, the pastor of Welsh Congregationalist churches in Oneida County, New York, and publisher of Y Cenhadwr Americanaidd (The American Missionary), a Welsh religious reform magazine that was pro-abolition. Also included are letters and materials of Mary Everett, a graduate of New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, who was also involved in the suffrage movement, John Roberts and Sarah Colgrove Everett, pioneers who moved to Kansas Territory in 1854 and were active in abolitionist activities, and Cynthia Everett, a member of the American Missionary Association who taught freedmen in Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina, following the Civil War. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Everett.xml#sum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide </a><br /><br />Letters to family from John Roberts Everett (1820-1896) and his wife, Sarah Colgrove Everett (1830-1864). John and Sarah emigrated to Kansas Territory in 1854, and the letters detail the hardships of pioneer life as well as the violent and chaotic environment created by anti-slavery and pro-slavery forces fighting over the territory's status. An abolitionist, John Roberts Everett was active in the the Free Soil movement during his time in Kansas, and present with John Brown at the Battle of Osawatomie on August 30, 1856. Due to Sarah's failing health, the family moved back east. After Sarah's death in 1864, John lived briefly with family in New York and worked for his father's printing press, but later returned to Kansas with and established himself as a farmer.

                "text": "Robert Everett was born in 1791, in Gronant, Flintshire, in northeast Wales. He graduated from Wrexham Seminary in 1815, and soon after was ordained a minister with the Congregationalists at Capel Lôn Swan, Denbigh. During this time Everett learned a system of shorthand writing, which he adapted to the Welsh language and continued to use throughout his life. While at Denbigh he wrote an instructional book of this shorthand writing, as well as a Sunday school catechism first published in 1822. He married Elizabeth Roberts, of Denbigh, in 1816, and the couple emigrated to America in 1823 when Everett accepted a call to the Welsh Congregational Church of Utica, NY. He remained in Utica nine years, then moved south to Winfield to become pastor of the Congregational Church there, and also spent a short time as pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Westernville. In 1838 he settled in Steuben, near Remsen, NY, where he took charge of the two Welsh chapels there, Capel Ucha and Penymynydd. Everett continued as pastor in Steuben until his death in 1875. Included here are sermons delivered between 1800 and 1860. Note that the early sermons were most likely not written by Everett, but probably revised and delivered by him. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Everett.xml#sum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

                "text": "Robert Everett was born in 1791, in Gronant, Flintshire, in northeast Wales. He graduated from Wrexham Seminary in 1815, and soon after was ordained a minister with the Congregationalists at Capel Lôn Swan, Denbigh. During this time Everett learned a system of shorthand writing, which he adapted to the Welsh language and continued to use throughout his life. While at Denbigh he wrote an instructional book of this shorthand writing, as well as a Sunday school catechism first published in 1822. He married Elizabeth Roberts, of Denbigh, in 1816, and the couple emigrated to America in 1823 when Everett accepted a call to the Welsh Congregational Church of Utica, NY. He remained in Utica nine years, then moved south to Winfield to become pastor of the Congregational Church there, and also spent a short time as pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Westernville. In 1838 he settled in Steuben, near Remsen, NY, where he took charge of the two Welsh chapels there, Capel Ucha and Penymynydd. Everett continued as pastor in Steuben until his death in 1875. Included here are sermons delivered between 1800 and 1860. Note that the early sermons were most likely not written by Everett, but probably revised and delivered by him. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Everett.xml#sum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

John and Sarah emigrated to Kansas Territory in 1854, and the letters detail the hardships of pioneer life as well as the violent and chaotic environment created by anti-slavery and pro-slavery forces fighting over the territory's status. An abolitionist, John Roberts Everett was active in the the Free Soil movement during his time in Kansas, and present with John Brown at the Battle of Osawatomie on August 30, 1856. Due to Sarah's failing health, the family moved back east. After Sarah's death in 1864, John lived briefly with family in New York and worked for his father's printing press, but later returned to Kansas with and established himself as a farmer. Later letters describe personal news, health, and farm issues.",

Printing, education, pioneer life, and religion are all discussed within the letters. Included are the papers of Robert Everett, the pastor of Welsh Congregationalist churches in Oneida County, New York, and publisher of Y Cenhadwr Americanaidd (The American Missionary), a Welsh religious reform magazine that was pro-abolition. Also included are letters and materials of Mary Everett, a graduate of New York Medical College and Hospital for Women, who was also involved in the suffrage movement, John Roberts and Sarah Colgrove Everett, pioneers who moved to Kansas Territory in 1854 and were active in abolitionist activities, and Cynthia Everett, a member of the American Missionary Association who taught freedmen in Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina, following the Civil War. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Everett.xml#series2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide<br /><br /></a> Edward Williams Everett (1843-1920) was the youngest of the 11 Everett children. He lived in Turin, NY, where he married Mary Allen in 1869. The couple had four sons, Jay Carroll, Charles, Robert, and Edward. In 1885 the family moved to Olpe, KS, south of Emporia, where Edward opened a general store near the home of his brother John Roberts Everett. He also served as postmaster at Olpe, from 1893 until 1897. Two more sons, Ray and Harry, were born in Kansas. Edward's letters describe the 1885 journey from New York to Kansas, and the family's life there, including encounters with Indians and pioneers traveling west. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Everett.xml#series2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><br /><br /></a><a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Everett.xml#series2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><br /></a>",

Also born in Massachusetts in 1827, Abby Reed became a New England school teacher. Friendships among the members of the Kendall and Reed families led to the marriage of Nathan and Abby in 1857. By the end of the 1860s, the couple had acquired considerable agricultural land in Illinois and Indiana, so after losing his position as a superintendent for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and as a mill owner, Nathan hoped to find success as a farmer. Abby bore four sons: Edgar, Winthrop, George and Arthur, losing two other children in infancy. Farming proved to be a struggle, for Nathan's health was always poor and his lungs weak, and Abby felt the need for periodic trips back to Warwick, Mass. to visit her family - especially to see her sister Mary, who was her closest friend. Nathan Kendall died in 1871, just after he had decided that perhaps relocating in the South would help his lung disease. For the next few years Abby and the children lived in New England, renting out the Indiana farm, before returning to live permanently in the Middle West. At the time of her death in 1912, Abby owned property in Fowler, Indiana and in Hudson, Massachusetts. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/KendallReed.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

                "text": "Both from Massachusetts, Nathan Kendall and Abby J. Reed married in 1857 and raised a family of four sons, first in Indiana and later in Illinois.<br /><br />Nathan Kendall was born in 1824 and Abby J. Reed in 1927. Nathan served as principal in academies in Kentucky and New England before becoming a civil engineer in 1853 and moving to LaPorte, Indiana to work for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and then to own and operate a lumber mill. Abby Reed and her sister Mary were New England school teachers, and the friendships among the members of the Kendall and Reed families led to the marriage of Nathan and Abby in 1857.<br /><br />Nathan's first wife, Josephine Stedman, died in childbirth in 1854. As the Kendalls and Reed families were friends, Abby then began a correspondence with Nathan. They were married in 1857 and settled in LaPorte, Indiana and then in Kankakee, Illinois. By the end of the 1860s the couple had acquired considerable agricultural land in these two states, so after disappointment as a superintendent for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and as a mill owner, Nathan hoped to find success as a farmer. Abby bore four sons: Edgar, Winthrop, George and Arthur, losing two other children in infancy. Farming proved to be a struggle, for Nathan's health was always poor and his lungs weak, and Abby felt the need for periodic trips back to Warwick, Mass. to visit her family - especially to see her sister Mary, who was her closest friend.<br /><br />Nathan Kendall died in 1871, just after he had decided that perhaps relocating in the South would help his lung disease. For the next few years Abby and the children lived in New England, renting out the Indiana farm, before returning to live permanently in the Middle West. At the time of her death in 1912, Abby owned property in Fowler, Indiana and in Hudson, Massachusetts.<br /><br />This collection includes the correspondence, but also manuscripts and biographical notes, of Nathan Kendall, his wife, Abby J. Reed Kendall, and their immediate families and friends, dating primarily from the two decades preceding the Civil War. Included are the couple's courtship letters as well as correspondence during later separations when one or the other of them was traveling, and a collection of their small diaries. There is correspondence and a few transcriptions of the narration of Charles Reed (Abby J. Reed's brother) concerning his 1849 overland journey to California and his subsequent adventures with the Washington City and California Mining Association, his prospecting on the Feather River and near Downieville, and his 1854 survival of a shipwreck off the California coast. News of close friends who took the Panama route to California is also included in the correspondence of Agnes Allen. Also included are numerous schoolgirl essays. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/KendallReed.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

                "text": "Born in Massachusetts in 1824, Nathan Kendall served as principal in academies in Kentucky and New England before becoming a civil engineer in 1853 and moving to LaPorte, Indiana to work for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and then to own and operate a lumber mill. Also born in Massachusetts in 1827, Abby Reed became a New England school teacher. Friendships among the members of the Kendall and Reed families led to the marriage of Nathan and Abby in 1857. By the end of the 1860s, the couple had acquired considerable agricultural land in Illinois and Indiana, so after losing his position as a superintendent for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and as a mill owner, Nathan hoped to find success as a farmer. Abby bore four sons: Edgar, Winthrop, George and Arthur, losing two other children in infancy. Farming proved to be a struggle, for Nathan's health was always poor and his lungs weak, and Abby felt the need for periodic trips back to Warwick, Mass. to visit her family - especially to see her sister Mary, who was her closest friend. Nathan Kendall died in 1871, just after he had decided that perhaps relocating in the South would help his lung disease. For the next few years Abby and the children lived in New England, renting out the Indiana farm, before returning to live permanently in the Middle West. At the time of her death in 1912, Abby owned property in Fowler, Indiana and in Hudson, Massachusetts. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/KendallReed.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

Also born in Massachusetts in 1827, Abby Reed became a New England school teacher. Friendships among the members of the Kendall and Reed families led to the marriage of Nathan and Abby in 1857. By the end of the 1860s, the couple had acquired considerable agricultural land in Illinois and Indiana, so after losing his position as a superintendent for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and as a mill owner, Nathan hoped to find success as a farmer. Abby bore four sons: Edgar, Winthrop, George and Arthur, losing two other children in infancy. Farming proved to be a struggle, for Nathan's health was always poor and his lungs weak, and Abby felt the need for periodic trips back to Warwick, Mass. to visit her family - especially to see her sister Mary, who was her closest friend. Nathan Kendall died in 1871, just after he had decided that perhaps relocating in the South would help his lung disease. For the next few years Abby and the children lived in New England, renting out the Indiana farm, before returning to live permanently in the Middle West. At the time of her death in 1912, Abby owned property in Fowler, Indiana and in Hudson, Massachusetts. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/KendallReed.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

Also born in Massachusetts in 1827, Abby Reed became a New England school teacher. Friendships among the members of the Kendall and Reed families led to the marriage of Nathan and Abby in 1857. By the end of the 1860s, the couple had acquired considerable agricultural land in Illinois and Indiana, so after losing his position as a superintendent for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and as a mill owner, Nathan hoped to find success as a farmer. Abby bore four sons: Edgar, Winthrop, George and Arthur, losing two other children in infancy. Farming proved to be a struggle, for Nathan's health was always poor and his lungs weak, and Abby felt the need for periodic trips back to Warwick, Mass. to visit her family - especially to see her sister Mary, who was her closest friend. Nathan Kendall died in 1871, just after he had decided that perhaps relocating in the South would help his lung disease. For the next few years Abby and the children lived in New England, renting out the Indiana farm, before returning to live permanently in the Middle West. At the time of her death in 1912, Abby owned property in Fowler, Indiana and in Hudson, Massachusetts. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/KendallReed.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

Also born in Massachusetts in 1827, Abby Reed became a New England school teacher. Friendships among the members of the Kendall and Reed families led to the marriage of Nathan and Abby in 1857. By the end of the 1860s, the couple had acquired considerable agricultural land in Illinois and Indiana, so after losing his position as a superintendent for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and as a mill owner, Nathan hoped to find success as a farmer. Abby bore four sons: Edgar, Winthrop, George and Arthur, losing two other children in infancy. Farming proved to be a struggle, for Nathan's health was always poor and his lungs weak, and Abby felt the need for periodic trips back to Warwick, Mass. to visit her family - especially to see her sister Mary, who was her closest friend. Nathan Kendall died in 1871, just after he had decided that perhaps relocating in the South would help his lung disease. For the next few years Abby and the children lived in New England, renting out the Indiana farm, before returning to live permanently in the Middle West. At the time of her death in 1912, Abby owned property in Fowler, Indiana and in Hudson, Massachusetts. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/KendallReed.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

                "text": "Born in Massachusetts in 1824, Nathan Kendall served as principal in academies in Kentucky and New England before becoming a civil engineer in 1853 and moving to LaPorte, Indiana to work for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and then to own and operate a lumber mill. Also born in Massachusetts in 1827, Abby Reed became a New England school teacher. Friendships among the members of the Kendall and Reed families led to the marriage of Nathan and Abby in 1857. By the end of the 1860s, the couple had acquired considerable agricultural land in Illinois and Indiana, so after losing his position as a superintendent for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and as a mill owner, Nathan hoped to find success as a farmer. Abby bore four sons: Edgar, Winthrop, George and Arthur, losing two other children in infancy. Farming proved to be a struggle, for Nathan's health was always poor and his lungs weak, and Abby felt the need for periodic trips back to Warwick, Mass. to visit her family - especially to see her sister Mary, who was her closest friend. Nathan Kendall died in 1871, just after he had decided that perhaps relocating in the South would help his lung disease. For the next few years Abby and the children lived in New England, renting out the Indiana farm, before returning to live permanently in the Middle West. At the time of her death in 1912, Abby owned property in Fowler, Indiana and in Hudson, Massachusetts. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/KendallReed.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

                "text": "Born in Massachusetts in 1824, Nathan Kendall served as principal in academies in Kentucky and New England before becoming a civil engineer in 1853 and moving to LaPorte, Indiana to work for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and then to own and operate a lumber mill. Also born in Massachusetts in 1827, Abby Reed became a New England school teacher. Friendships among the members of the Kendall and Reed families led to the marriage of Nathan and Abby in 1857. By the end of the 1860s, the couple had acquired considerable agricultural land in Illinois and Indiana, so after losing his position as a superintendent for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and as a mill owner, Nathan hoped to find success as a farmer. Abby bore four sons: Edgar, Winthrop, George and Arthur, losing two other children in infancy. Farming proved to be a struggle, for Nathan's health was always poor and his lungs weak, and Abby felt the need for periodic trips back to Warwick, Mass. to visit her family - especially to see her sister Mary, who was her closest friend. Nathan Kendall died in 1871, just after he had decided that perhaps relocating in the South would help his lung disease. For the next few years Abby and the children lived in New England, renting out the Indiana farm, before returning to live permanently in the Middle West. At the time of her death in 1912, Abby owned property in Fowler, Indiana and in Hudson, Massachusetts. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/KendallReed.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

                "text": "Born in Massachusetts in 1824, Nathan Kendall served as principal in academies in Kentucky and New England before becoming a civil engineer in 1853 and moving to LaPorte, Indiana to work for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and then to own and operate a lumber mill. Also born in Massachusetts in 1827, Abby Reed became a New England school teacher. Friendships among the members of the Kendall and Reed families led to the marriage of Nathan and Abby in 1857. By the end of the 1860s, the couple had acquired considerable agricultural land in Illinois and Indiana, so after losing his position as a superintendent for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and as a mill owner, Nathan hoped to find success as a farmer. Abby bore four sons: Edgar, Winthrop, George and Arthur, losing two other children in infancy. Farming proved to be a struggle, for Nathan's health was always poor and his lungs weak, and Abby felt the need for periodic trips back to Warwick, Mass. to visit her family - especially to see her sister Mary, who was her closest friend. Nathan Kendall died in 1871, just after he had decided that perhaps relocating in the South would help his lung disease. For the next few years Abby and the children lived in New England, renting out the Indiana farm, before returning to live permanently in the Middle West. At the time of her death in 1912, Abby owned property in Fowler, Indiana and in Hudson, Massachusetts. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/KendallReed.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

Also born in Massachusetts in 1827, Abby Reed became a New England school teacher. Friendships among the members of the Kendall and Reed families led to the marriage of Nathan and Abby in 1857. By the end of the 1860s, the couple had acquired considerable agricultural land in Illinois and Indiana, so after losing his position as a superintendent for the Cincinnati, Peru and Chicago Railway and as a mill owner, Nathan hoped to find success as a farmer. Abby bore four sons: Edgar, Winthrop, George and Arthur, losing two other children in infancy. Farming proved to be a struggle, for Nathan's health was always poor and his lungs weak, and Abby felt the need for periodic trips back to Warwick, Mass. to visit her family - especially to see her sister Mary, who was her closest friend. Nathan Kendall died in 1871, just after he had decided that perhaps relocating in the South would help his lung disease. For the next few years Abby and the children lived in New England, renting out the Indiana farm, before returning to live permanently in the Middle West. At the time of her death in 1912, Abby owned property in Fowler, Indiana and in Hudson, Massachusetts. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/KendallReed.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

At the time of her death in 1912, Abby owned property in Fowler, Indiana and in Hudson, Massachusetts. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/KendallReed.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

He was married to Lucy Wetmore (1748-1826) daughter of Seth Wetmore. After two years in the ministry, Whittelsey resigned from his church and began a life of commercial activities in the clothing business. During the Revolution he was a purchasing agent for the Continental Army in Connecticut and after the War, through the 1790's, he continued as an Army supplier to the United States 2nd Regiment. Whittelsey achieved some status in the community, serving as Middletown alderman, representative to the Connecticut State Legislature (1809-1811) and Collector of the Port (1797-1801), besides being a deacon of the Congregational Church for twenty-three years. In 1783, he was appointed as administrator of the confiscated properties of James Jauncey (d. 1790) a Loyalist of New York. Whittelsey died in 1812. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/whittelsey.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

The collection includes two letters of the Reverend William Barlow relating to his wooing of Sally Canfield, a religious poem dedicated to his parishioner Mary Matilda Richards (who later married the younger William Barlow), and a notebook of a sermon apparently delivered several times over a twenty-year period. Also included are the draft of an address to be delivered to the American Institute on the subject of the appropriate disposition of the funds given to establish the Smithsonian Institution, as well as eleven letters from William Barlow the younger, to his wife, Matilda Richards Barlow, 1842-1851. Barlow, unemployed at the time of the bulk of the correspondence, apparently had tuberculosis. The content of the letters mostly concerns his poor health and his feelings about his uncertain future. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Barlow.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

Written between 1909 and 1926, the letters provide documentation of friendship, professional collaboration, and a shared interest in reading. They also demonstrate the famous lawyer's concern and affection for his only child, Paul, who was living in Greeley as the manager of the Greeley Gas and Fuel Company. Subjects include the case of Stewart v. Ramsay; some allusions to Darrow's legal role in the Los Angeles bombing case and his bribery indictment; recommended reading and opinions on philosophical and psychological books; Darrow's desire to rent and/or own a cottage in Estes Park, Colorado; money and investments, and above all, Paul's welfare. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/JacobsDarrow.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

                "text": "In 1843, Elbert Ozial Taylor was born to Ozial Taylor and Laura Cowdery Taylor in Rushford, New York. He received a bachelor’s and master’s from the University of Chicago sometime between 1868 and 1871, later attaining a master’s from Chicago and a Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) from Ewing College. He married Elizabeth Ann Winegar in 1871 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, one of the cities in which he served as pastor. In 1877, he became a minister at Belden Avenue Baptist Church of Chicago. Following about 10 years in Chicago, he became a notable national temperance lecturer. In his later years, he lived in Boston and Newburyport, Massachusetts. He passed away in 1920 in his birthplace of Rushford. Most of the materials here consist of Taylor’s sermons in various stages, from outlines to final drafts. Topics covered tend to be fairly conventional religious subjects with somewhat scholarly inflections. The sermons appear to come from a period prior to his days as a national temperance lecturer and therefore rarely focus on alcohol. However, the miscellaneous documents in the second series do extend to the late 1880s and early 1890s and therefore include some advertisements (in the form of a broadside and handbills) of his temperance lectures, as well as a letter from the Prohibitionist Samuel D. Hastings. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/TaylorE.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

He received a bachelor’s and master’s from the University of Chicago sometime between 1868 and 1871, later attaining a master’s from Chicago and a Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) from Ewing College. He married Elizabeth Ann Winegar in 1871 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, one of the cities in which he served as pastor. In 1877, he became a minister at Belden Avenue Baptist Church of Chicago. Following about 10 years in Chicago, he became a notable national temperance lecturer. In his later years, he lived in Boston and Newburyport, Massachusetts. He passed away in 1920 in his birthplace of Rushford. Most of the materials here consist of Taylor’s sermons in various stages, from outlines to final drafts. Topics covered tend to be fairly conventional religious subjects with somewhat scholarly inflections. The sermons appear to come from a period prior to his days as a national temperance lecturer and therefore rarely focus on alcohol. However, the miscellaneous documents in the second series do extend to the late 1880s and early 1890s and therefore include some advertisements (in the form of a broadside and handbills) of his temperance lectures, as well as a letter from the Prohibitionist Samuel D.

                "text": "In 1843, Elbert Ozial Taylor was born to Ozial Taylor and Laura Cowdery Taylor in Rushford, New York. He received a bachelor’s and master’s from the University of Chicago sometime between 1868 and 1871, later attaining a master’s from Chicago and a Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) from Ewing College. He married Elizabeth Ann Winegar in 1871 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, one of the cities in which he served as pastor. In 1877, he became a minister at Belden Avenue Baptist Church of Chicago. Following about 10 years in Chicago, he became a notable national temperance lecturer. In his later years, he lived in Boston and Newburyport, Massachusetts. He passed away in 1920 in his birthplace of Rushford. Most of the materials here consist of Taylor’s sermons in various stages, from outlines to final drafts. Topics covered tend to be fairly conventional religious subjects with somewhat scholarly inflections. The sermons appear to come from a period prior to his days as a national temperance lecturer and therefore rarely focus on alcohol. However, the miscellaneous documents in the second series do extend to the late 1880s and early 1890s and therefore include some advertisements (in the form of a broadside and handbills) of his temperance lectures, as well as a letter from the Prohibitionist Samuel D.

His father was a well-known abolitionist who was later nominated as the first vice presidential candidate for the Liberty Party. In 1876, Francis J. LeMoyne erected the first crematorium in the United States near Washington, Pennsylvania. John LeMoyne studied law in Pittsburgh and was admitted to the bar in 1852. That same year he toured the West, deciding to moved to Chicago and begin his law practice. He married with his wife, Julia, the following year. In 1872, LeMoyne became a candidate for the 43rd Congress on the Liberal Party ticket, but was defeated. He ran again for the 44th Congress as a Democrat and won. He served in Congress from May 6, 1876 to March 3, 1877. After losing the re-election, John continued his law practice in Chicago and was known as a \"lawyer of excellent standing and ability\". He retired in 1887 and moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where he died on July 27, 1918. <br /><br />Mainly in-coming correspondence to John V. LeMoyne, received between 1852-1875.

These letters focus on family affairs in Washington, Pennsylvania, and show his mother's strong religious beliefs. There are also a few letters from LeMoyne's father cautioning his son against speculating on Chicago real estate. Among other matters, letters from friends discuss opportunities in the West (Texas, California, Oregon) and the business climate in Milwaukee. <a href=\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=163916\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

His father was a well-known abolitionist who was later nominated as the first vice presidential candidate for the Liberty Party. In 1876, Francis J. LeMoyne erected the first crematorium in the United States near Washington, Pennsylvania. John LeMoyne studied law in Pittsburgh and was admitted to the bar in 1852. That same year he toured the West, deciding to moved to Chicago and begin his law practice. He married with his wife, Julia, the following year. In 1872, LeMoyne became a candidate for the 43rd Congress on the Liberal Party ticket, but was defeated. He ran again for the 44th Congress as a Democrat and won. He served in Congress from May 6, 1876 to March 3, 1877. After losing the re-election, John continued his law practice in Chicago and was known as a \"lawyer of excellent standing and ability\". He retired in 1887 and moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where he died on July 27, 1918. <br /><br />Mainly in-coming correspondence to John V. LeMoyne, received between 1852-1875.

These letters focus on family affairs in Washington, Pennsylvania, and show his mother's strong religious beliefs. There are also a few letters from LeMoyne's father cautioning his son against speculating on Chicago real estate. Among other matters, letters from friends discuss opportunities in the West (Texas, California, Oregon) and the business climate in Milwaukee. <a href=\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=163916\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

                "text": "John Valcoulon LeMoyne was born in Washington Park, Pennsylvania, on Nov. 17, 1828, and was the son of Madeleine Romaine Bureau LeMoyne and Francis Julius LeMoyne. His father was a well-known abolitionist who was later nominated as the first vice presidential candidate for the Liberty Party. In 1876, Francis J. LeMoyne erected the first crematorium in the United States near Washington, Pennsylvania. John LeMoyne studied law in Pittsburgh and was admitted to the bar in 1852. That same year he toured the West, deciding to moved to Chicago and begin his law practice. He married with his wife, Julia, the following year. In 1872, LeMoyne became a candidate for the 43rd Congress on the Liberal Party ticket, but was defeated. He ran again for the 44th Congress as a Democrat and won. He served in Congress from May 6, 1876 to March 3, 1877. After losing the re-election, John continued his law practice in Chicago and was known as a \"lawyer of excellent standing and ability\". He retired in 1887 and moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where he died on July 27, 1918. <br /><br />Mainly in-coming correspondence to John V. LeMoyne, received between 1852-1875. The majority of the letters are from family members and friends in Washington, Pennsylvania, including Mary Anderson, Nettie Kennedy, Francis Julius LeMoyne, Frank LeMoyne, Jane LeMoyne, Julia LeMoyne, Madeline LeMoyne, Madeline Romaine Bureau LeMoyne, Nannie LeMoyne, Romaine LeMoyne, Thurston LeMoyne, Lizzie Shaler, Charlotte Wills, John Wills, and Wilma Wills. These letters focus on family affairs in Washington, Pennsylvania, and show his mother's strong religious beliefs. There are also a few letters from LeMoyne's father cautioning his son against speculating on Chicago real estate. Among other matters, letters from friends discuss opportunities in the West (Texas, California, Oregon) and the business climate in Milwaukee. <a href=\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=163916\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

The letters touch on many subjects that concerned typical Americans during World War I, the 1920s and then the Depression, such as the shortages and hardships, the influenza epidemic, the League of Nations, Prohibition, Hoover’s presidency, labor strikes, and so on. Daland offers much advice to Gerard, who was always in need of money and clothes, and to her daughter who was becoming an unsuccessful artist. Included in the collection is a fragment of a letter from Tucker Daland announcing Emily’s death in 1933 and three letters from Gerard to Daland. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/Daland.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

                "text": "The daughter of Walter Loomis Newberry, the Chicago-based banker and real estate mogul whose bequest was used to found the Newberry Library in 1887, Julia Newberry rejected the comfortable but conventional life expected of her. Resisting the entreaties of men as illustrious as Colonel Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte, grandnephew of Napoleon I, Julia chose to follow her father’s advice: “‘<a href=\"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/scripto/transcribe/215/48360#transcription\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Be somebody, July.’ Papa always used to say, &amp; ‘be somebody’ I WILL. I’ve always been told I had plenty of brains, &amp; every natural advantage; so why shouldn’t I be Somebody???</a>” <br /><br />Yet the pace of her life exacerbated an underlying ailment, and in 1869 she fell seriously ill with an affliction assumed to be a “nervous” condition. Reporting the conclusion of her doctor, Julia writes that “<a href=\"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/scripto/transcribe/215/48436#transcription\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I am not allowed to read anything serious or have any kind of a lesson…I think I think the whole time &amp; that I cant help</a>.” Unsurprisingly, such cures proved ineffective, and Julia died in 1876. <a href=\"https://webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=574581\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View catalog record</a> | <a href=\"http://collections.carli.illinois.edu/cdm/ref/collection/nby_mms/id/40934\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View in digital collection</a>",

                "text": "Lucy Monroe Calhoun, sister of poet and editor Harriet Monroe, was born in 1865. Before her marriage to William J. Calhoun, she had been a freelance art critic for Chicago newspapers as well as national publications. When her husband served as U.S. minister to China, she became the social leader of the diplomatic community in Peking.<br /><br />After her husband’s death, Lucy Calhoun served in the war effort in France in World War I. In the 1920’s she returned to Peking, established her home in an ancient temple, collected art, and become an “institution” in the city. She remained in Peking until the Japanese occupation of the city in 1937.Lucy Monroe Calhoun died in Chicago in 1950, aged 85.<br /><br />The collection includes six letters by Lucy Monroe Calhoun and three by husband William J. Calhoun (U.S.Minister to China, 1909-1913), regarding their experiences in China during the last years of the Qing Dynasty. One letter describes in detail the wedding of Emperor Puyi in December, 1922. A seventh letter relates Lucy Calhoun’s visit to LeMans, France, which served as an embarkation point for troops at the conclusion of World War I. <a href=\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=817922\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

                "text": "Jenny Dufau, a leading French soprano with the Chicago Grand Opera Company beginning in 1911, was described as the “smallest soprano” of the opera company. By 1912 she was singing important roles in Die Walkyrie in German, The Barber of Seville and The Jewels of the Madonna in Italian, and The Tales of Hoffmann in English. A native of Alsace-Lorraine, Dufau had arrived on the Chicago musical scene in 1910 following studies in Berlin, and almost immediately was successful with audiences. After 1916 she concentrated on a concert career, appearing at Ravinia and in Hamilton Park concert series, in Orchestra Hall and in Boston, among other places. In May, 1916, she sang with the silent film The Law Decides, which was one of the latest of entertainments called “Cinema Concerts.” In a 1917 recital at Orchestra Hall she sang La Marseillaise as apparently was the custom, followed by “an eclectic program” of Russian, Swedish and French songs, along with new songs written for her by Frank LaForge. Dufau’s name no longer appears in the Chicago papers after 1917, so presumably she returned to Europe at the end of the war.<br /><br />This collection consists almost entirely of letters written to Jenny Dufau by an Italian lover named Gaetano Riccuilli from September 1915, to April 1917, while Dufau was performing with the Chicago Grand Opera Company. Most of these letters concern his family or hers, the events of his daily life, the fact of their separation due to the war, and his many moods. Ricciulli apparently was an active service army officer on disability leave at the time of these letters.<br /><br />The principle historical interest of the letters lies in the many passing references to the war, especially to its disruption of civilian life in Italy, and to a lesser degree in France and Switzerland. There are repeated references to censorship, and the development of censorship is traceable by evidence on the envelopes. For a brief time after the start of censorship his letters become more circumspect, but they return to the passionate tone of the earlier ones fairly quickly. One letter speculates on the possibility that America may enter the war on the side of the Italian-French-English alliance. Except in a very general way, there is no information here on the progress of the war itself or of civilian morale, as these topics undoubtedly would have been censored. <a href=\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=808377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>\n<p></p>",

In both towns they ran saw mills. The Haydens had twelve children, several of whom died in infancy. Both Hannah and Hezekiah died in 1823.<br /><br />This collection is composed mainly of letters written by Hannah Hayden from Hartwick and Springfield, Otsego County, New York, to her parents and siblings in Windsor, Connecticut, which discuss the details of everyday life: births, deaths, accidents, sicknesses, meetings, etc. The letters are pasted into a Jackson, Michigan general store receipt book, dated 1845-1847.<br /><br />The correspondence, supplemented by a few other family letters, was compiled by son Henry A. Hayden in 1875. <a href=\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=822984\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

                "text": "Ann Augusta Jaquins Hurd (generally referred to as “Augusta”) was born February 28, 1834, at Bainbridge, New York, the descendant of New York and New England families. As several of her siblings moved westward into Wisconsin, she followed, and though she was trained to teach school she married Asa Hurd of Brandon, Wisconsin in 1859. The young Hurds bought land in Minnesota and attempted to become successful farmers.<br /><br />Augusta and Asa Hurd had one daughter born in 1862, whom they named Mary Olivia. Six and a half months later Asa joined the Union Army as a wagoner of Company E, 10th Minnesota Infantry and Augusta and her baby rejoined her sister in the more settled and stable town of Brandon, Wisconsin. Asa never returned from the war, having apparently been killed in April, 1865, outside Montgomery, Alabama, while foraging for his company, although there is some possibility he simply disappeared west as veterans sometimes did. Augusta never remarried. She supported herself and her daughter Mary by land speculation in Minnesota and South Dakota at a time when settlers were pouring into the Territories. She had the skill to buy and rent houses and land, while she also traveled back to Bainbridge New York to be with her father. When he died, Augusta became active in the Suffrage Movement.<br /><br />Mary Olivia Hurd married Daniel Clark Arno in 1884 and a long and difficult relationship began, as Mary Olivia’s letters to her mother reveal. Dan Arno was quick-tempered and sometimes abusive. He was a skilled carpenter and builder of houses, often away from home, leaving Mary to cope with the hardships of rural life and isolated motherhood in or near Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Mary followed her mother’s example of dealing in westward speculation, but a severe financial and agricultural depression kept profits low and farming was arduous. Mary’s letters to her mother between 1886 and 1897 refer to her longing to be near her, and in 1898 Ann Augusta Hurd permanently left New York and settled with her daughter in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, in a home built by her son-in-law, Dan Arno. Augusta Hurd died in 1921 and Mary Hurd Arno died in 1925.<br /><br />This collection is composed mainly of letters from Mary Olivia Hurd Arno to her mother, 1886-1897, with six letters of Augusta Jaquins Hurd to her father and brother, 1858-1866, and seventeen miscellaneous letters either to her or retained by her.<br /><br />Note: This collection has been published; see <em>The Letters of Ann Augusta Jaquins Hurd and Mary Olivia Hurd Arno, 1858-1897</em>, edited by Helen Hazen Cooperman (Chicago: Cooperman, 1988). <a href=\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=808762\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

                "text": "Ann Augusta Jaquins Hurd (generally referred to as “Augusta”) was born February 28, 1834, at Bainbridge, New York, the descendant of New York and New England families. As several of her siblings moved westward into Wisconsin, she followed, and though she was trained to teach school she married Asa Hurd of Brandon, Wisconsin in 1859. The young Hurds bought land in Minnesota and attempted to become successful farmers.<br /><br />Augusta and Asa Hurd had one daughter born in 1862, whom they named Mary Olivia. Six and a half months later Asa joined the Union Army as a wagoner of Company E, 10th Minnesota Infantry and Augusta and her baby rejoined her sister in the more settled and stable town of Brandon, Wisconsin. Asa never returned from the war, having apparently been killed in April, 1865, outside Montgomery, Alabama, while foraging for his company, although there is some possibility he simply disappeared west as veterans sometimes did. Augusta never remarried. She supported herself and her daughter Mary by land speculation in Minnesota and South Dakota at a time when settlers were pouring into the Territories. She had the skill to buy and rent houses and land, while she also traveled back to Bainbridge New York to be with her father. When he died, Augusta became active in the Suffrage Movement.<br /><br />Mary Olivia Hurd married Daniel Clark Arno in 1884 and a long and difficult relationship began, as Mary Olivia’s letters to her mother reveal. Dan Arno was quick-tempered and sometimes abusive. He was a skilled carpenter and builder of houses, often away from home, leaving Mary to cope with the hardships of rural life and isolated motherhood in or near Oshkosh, Wisconsin. Mary followed her mother’s example of dealing in westward speculation, but a severe financial and agricultural depression kept profits low and farming was arduous. Mary’s letters to her mother between 1886 and 1897 refer to her longing to be near her, and in 1898 Ann Augusta Hurd permanently left New York and settled with her daughter in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, in a home built by her son-in-law, Dan Arno. Augusta Hurd died in 1921 and Mary Hurd Arno died in 1925.<br /><br />This collection is composed mainly of letters from Mary Olivia Hurd Arno to her mother, 1886-1897, with six letters of Augusta Jaquins Hurd to her father and brother, 1858-1866, and seventeen miscellaneous letters either to her or retained by her.<br /><br />Note: This collection has been published; see <em>The Letters of Ann Augusta Jaquins Hurd and Mary Olivia Hurd Arno, 1858-1897</em>, edited by Helen Hazen Cooperman (Chicago: Cooperman, 1988). <a href=\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=808762\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

One of a group of nurses who left Chicago for Cuba during the Spanish-American War in July, 1898, she wrote about herself: \"We are the first body of women to go out in the time of war under the Government of the United States. What we go to face we do not know.\" Nursing in a camp hospital in Siboney, Cuba, for little over a month, Wingreen too contracted fever, but continued with her work until leaving in late August.<br /><br />The collection includes letters, often reading like a diary, which Amy Wingreen sent to her sister, mother and nephew as she traveled from Chicago to Cuba and back again to New York and Washington in the summer of 1898, plus a small group of letters to her from relatives and friends of some of the soldiers she nursed. The collection also includes miscellaneous material relating to her medical service from April, 1898, to December, 1899, and two narratives of her experiences, one by her and one by her (later) executor Esther Turkington. <a href=\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=184085\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

                "text": "Benjamin D. Hitz was a lifelong resident of Indianapolis, where he died in 1949. A graduate of Indiana University, Mr. Hitz was devoted to the intellectual and charitable institutions of his state, and throughout his life he was an avid collector of books and manuscripts, particularly of explorations of the Middle West and the works of Mary Webb and Willa Cather. His collection of Cather first editions and Cather-related correspondence was sold to the Newberry Library after his death. <br /><br />Although born in Virginia in 1873, Willa Cather was transplanted to Nebraska when she was nine. Her life on the pioneering frontier of the Great Plains made a lasting impression on her, shaping her talent and interests as she became familiar with the struggles for survival of the immigrant farm families she came to know.

                "text": "Irene Miner Weisz and her sisters Carrie Miner Sherwood and Mary Miner Creighton were childhood friends of Willa Cather in Red Cloud, Nebraska. Among other activities the Miner girls and Cather put on plays to entertain friends and families, and as the years passed they remained friends and correspondents. Irene Miner married Charles W. Weisz and spent her adult life in Chicago. <br /><br />Although Willa Cather was born in Virginia, in 1883 when she was 9, her father moved the family to Nebraska. This transition from the orderly South to the pioneering frontier of the Great Plains made a lasting impression on her and in her cultured but rather tomboyish youth she observed and became familiar with immigrant farm families struggling to conquer a sometimes hostile environment. The kinship she felt for the new Americans of Nebraska was later reflected in much of her fiction, notably in two of her best-known novels, O Pioneers! (1913) and My Antonia (1918). <br /><br />Cather graduated from the University of Nebraska in 1895 and began a career first as a teacher and then as a magazine editor, finally settling in New York City in 1906 as editor of McClure's Magazine. During these years she traveled a good deal, developing a special affection both for France and the American Southwest -- the latter described lovingly in the novel Death Comes to the Archbishop -- and then in 1912 she decided to concentrate on supporting herself as free-lance author. What followed was a life dedicated to writing, one in which she published twelve novels and fifty-eight short stories that brought her much popularity and numerous honors and prizes. <br /><br />Cather never married but she developed and maintained many close and enduring friendships. Some of these, as with the Miner sisters dating from her early life in Red Cloud, Nebraska, lasted all her life. Though in her later years she suffered from bouts of poor health, writing remained her passion and she continued to publish, concluding with Saphira and the Slave Girl in 1940. <br /><br />Willa Cather, generally regarded as one of the twentieth century's major American writers, died in New York in 1947.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/CatherW.xml\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View collection guide</a>",

James Gregory, and Col. Henry T. Farrar, travelled first by rail, exploring the new routes through the Royal Gorge of the Arkansas River and up the La Veta Pass. In particular, Strong discusses the party’s camping accomodations, the scenery encountered, the engineering and construction of difficult rail routes, and the wagon train’s treacherous passage from Grassy Hill to Niegoldstown over the Stony Pass. <a href=\"https://webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=132794\">View catalog record</a>",

Following years of fur trapping, guiding Fremont’s expeditions, and fighting in Indian battles, Carson was appointed U.S. Indian Agent in 1854 for the northern area of the New Mexico Territory. With home and office in Taos, Carson served in that capacity until 1861. It was during that period that he dictated his life story relating his adventurous years on the plains and in the mountains. <a href=\"https://webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=136955\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View catalog record</a>",

The overland diary begins Sept. 7, 1849, when the travelling party had reached the remains of the Donner Party camp in the Sierra Nevada, continues via Bear Valley to Sacramento, and ends in San Francisco on Oct. 8, 1849. It contains descriptions of food shortages, wagon travel across mountain ranges, and gold rush Sacramento and San Francisco. The journal of the 1851 voyage from San Francisco to New York describes hardships of travel on the recently inaugurated Nicaragua route via San Juan and Greytown, and an Atlantic voyage plagued by an inexperienced captain, coal and food shortages, and a massive storm. Journals of the 1854 voyages to and from San Francisco describe the Isthmus of Panama route and an encounter with Santa Anna's fleet, which was blockading the Acapulco harbor. <a href=\"https://webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=141142\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View catalog record</a>",

Stone, who later (1830-1839) published Catlin’s \"Notes of eight years travel amongst the North American Indians\" in his New York Commercial Advertiser. Responding to Benjamin Silliman (1841), Catlin defends his conclusions regarding the pipe stone quarry and forwards a copy of his new \"Letters and notes on the manners ... of the North American Indians,\" which contained his observations on the subject. Catlin also offers (1844?) to sell his \"Album,\" presumably \"Catlin’s North American Indian portfolio,\" for the reduced price of thirty pounds. Writing many years later to a Professor Harper, Catlin condemns the Jan., 1870, Piegan or Marias Massacre and the Indian policy of the U.S. military as revealed in a Mar., 1870, letter of Gen. P.H. Sheridan. <a href=\"https://webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=136396\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">View catalog record</a>",

Clark Caswell Broad during 1866-1868, containing personal and professional accounts of her life as a missionary to the Seneca Nation on the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation in Cattaraugus, N.Y. Caswell, known at this time as \"Miss Clark\", writes in pen and pencil of her activities on the reservation, including church meetings, fundraising, meetings of the Ladies Sewing Society, and visits with Indians, whom she describes as \"pagans\". She describes their poverty-stricken, desperate and humiliating existence, with no medical care, and in some cases, living five or six to a single ten-foot-square log cabin. Caswell also refers to her own health problems, incessant chills, exhaustion, and feelings of inadequacy: \"Blue! Desperate! Wish I was somebody else!\" Some of the entries from June 1868, written in a childish hand in pencil, are letters by Moses Crow, and by Indian students at the mission. <a href=\"https://webvoyage.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=394185\">View catalog record</a>",

Roberts primarily focus on his family’s daily farm life in Tazewell County, including routine farm activities, farming expenses and proberty valuations, illnesses and medicinal cures, family births and deaths, local events, and weather conditions. Prior to settlement in Illinois, Roberts was engaged as an apprentice to a lithographic firm in New York City. In the first two volumes he describes the technical aspects of making lithographic plates as well as an earlier trip he made in 1830 to St. Louis and Illinois returning home via New Orleans. The collection of diaries also includes his first wife’s (Mary W. Burhans) account of their trip to Morton in 1831 and his second wife’s (Ann Waters) account of a trip to New England she made in 1859. A few volumes contain miscellaneous sketches of Robert’s home and towns he visited in Illinois. <a href=\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/RobertsJ.xml\">View collection guide</a>.",

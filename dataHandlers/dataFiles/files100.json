Apr. 21 1885\nMy dear Sister,\nIt is sometime since we have had a letter from you, and we are beginning to feel anxious to know when you are going to be ready to come home. We are anxious to know how you are and what you are doing. Spring seems to be coming even to us at last. The snow is every day growing less, and the patches of bare ground becoming larger. The birds are singing around us, and all nature seems waking up from the long nap. Our greatest snow drifts seem to be just around our house, the north end of our garden is pretty full yet, and there are some pretty high drifts between the house and shed--still the boards are cleared, so that we have a good walk back and forth. Some of the pansies by Mrs. P's window are coming to light, and are full of birds, so \nhens in the village a week last Sat. We have had about a doz. eggs so far from these. They do not do so well as we hope they will by and by. Their yard is so full of snow \nthat they cannot run out any yet. I heard yesterday that Mr. Owen, the printer, has been sick a month with typhoid fever. He does not get along.

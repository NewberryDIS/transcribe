The general tenor of my thoughts is too grave, & I sometimes carry too sad a heart to attempt anything at levity. It was only at sister Della's wish & suggestion, that this poem was rewritten for the occasion. She secured for me this opportunity of then being represented in public, which was very acceptable; for I considered it one more step towards making my writings generally known. She wanted something that would make the audiense laugh-something jovial. So with her to dictate, I wrote; & in due season produced a poem of mine verses, which gave her entire satisfaction. They tell me that my effort was well delivered: & also quite favorably received. This pleased me; for I have seen enough of the vicissitudes of a writer's life, to know that when any of his pen-productions are thus received, it pleases him. But there is something more in this instance, which afforded a sense of pleasure & gratification. It is this - a sister's love, & her interest in my literary unclear.

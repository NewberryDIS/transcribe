He graduated from Wrexham Seminary in 1815, and soon after was ordained a minister with the Congregationalists at Capel Lôn Swan, Denbigh. During this time Everett learned a system of shorthand writing, which he adapted to the Welsh language and continued to use throughout his life. While at Denbigh he wrote an instructional book of this shorthand writing, as well as a Sunday school catechism first published in 1822. He married Elizabeth Roberts, of Denbigh, in 1816, and the couple emigrated to America in 1823 when Everett accepted a call to the Welsh Congregational Church of Utica, NY. He remained in Utica nine years, then moved south to Winfield to become pastor of the Congregational Church there, and also spent a short time as pastor of the Presbyterian Church at Westernville. In 1838 he settled in Steuben, near Remsen, NY, where he took charge of the two Welsh chapels there, Capel Ucha and Penymynydd. Everett continued as pastor in Steuben until his death in 1875. Included here are sermons delivered between 1800 and 1860.

I take the liberty to reply. W.L. CHAPLIN goes. He leaves this city the last of this month, and will be in Washington the 1st of December, when the session commences. Mr. Leavitt, we are informed, does not go; Mr. C. will probably be the only man on whom the Liberty Party can rely for an exposition of the doings of that body.\\nShall they make the most of his mission? That they may do so, we have at a great expense and risk enlarged the Patriot, so that in size it surpasses any paper, political or religious, published for any party or any sect in the State of New-York, west of New-York city. This has been done that Mr. C. may have full scope for his observations in its columns, and its readers at the same time be furnished with the doings of the State Legislature, while local and general news, as well as miscellaneous reading, can be also given in abundance, without interfering with its leading object, the advocacy of Liberty Principles. To meet the outlay, and to scatter wide into every district of this State the reports which Mr. C. will make weekly, we want TWO THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS FOR THE SESSION, at a DOLLAR EACH. The session will hold at least seven months, probably longer. Whatever its term be, six months or eight - it will not fall under or go over these - we will take subscribers at a Dollar each, more or less, at one Post-Office - cash invariably in advance.\\nLiberty men well know how dark and mysterious to them were the District of Columbia and the Halls of Congress, till Joshua Leavitt first bearded the Slave Power in its den, and seated himself as a Sentinel for Freedom under its terrible gaze. Since that day, how much light and knowledge have come to us! Of all the instrumentalities we have ever used, no one has been more invaluable than that of maintaining a Reporter at Washington. At this time of day, when the conflict thickens, when Freedom lifts her head up cheerily, when Slavery hears the humming of \\"the people\'s voice,\\" as it gathers to the rescue of the Constitution and the Country, shall Liberty men, for want of spirit and self-denial, allow to ebb the flood tide which bears to victory those who trust to its bosom? Never! no, never!\\nWell, then, my good friend, out of two hundred picked men, you are one of whom we ask the labor and toil of sending us ten subscribers for the session. Will you do it? Will you try? If you try and cannot get ten, get what you can and send them on. Whether one or twenty, the price is a Dollar a copy. But we rely on you for ten copies at least. Come, comrade, brush up your armor, and in the strength and faith of a true heart, devote yourself to this work for a day or two, and send us the results. What you do, should not be delayed. Your list ought to be entered so as to commence with the session, and that is at hand. You can as well do it now as by and by, and a little better.\\nOne word more.

By 1912 she was singing important roles in Die Walkyrie in German, The Barber of Seville and The Jewels of the Madonna in Italian, and The Tales of Hoffmann in English. A native of Alsace-Lorraine, Dufau had arrived on the Chicago musical scene in 1910 following studies in Berlin, and almost immediately was successful with audiences. After 1916 she concentrated on a concert career, appearing at Ravinia and in Hamilton Park concert series, in Orchestra Hall and in Boston, among other places. In May, 1916, she sang with the silent film The Law Decides, which was one of the latest of entertainments called “Cinema Concerts.” In a 1917 recital at Orchestra Hall she sang La Marseillaise as apparently was the custom, followed by “an eclectic program” of Russian, Swedish and French songs, along with new songs written for her by Frank LaForge. Dufau’s name no longer appears in the Chicago papers after 1917, so presumably she returned to Europe at the end of the war.<br /><br />This collection consists almost entirely of letters written to Jenny Dufau by an Italian lover named Gaetano Riccuilli from September 1915, to April 1917, while Dufau was performing with the Chicago Grand Opera Company. Most of these letters concern his family or hers, the events of his daily life, the fact of their separation due to the war, and his many moods. Ricciulli apparently was an active service army officer on disability leave at the time of these letters.<br /><br />The principle historical interest of the letters lies in the many passing references to the war, especially to its disruption of civilian life in Italy, and to a lesser degree in France and Switzerland. There are repeated references to censorship, and the development of censorship is traceable by evidence on the envelopes. For a brief time after the start of censorship his letters become more circumspect, but they return to the passionate tone of the earlier ones fairly quickly. One letter speculates on the possibility that America may enter the war on the side of the Italian-French-English alliance. Except in a very general way, there is no information here on the progress of the war itself or of civilian morale, as these topics undoubtedly would have been censored. <a href=\\"https://i-share.carli.illinois.edu/nby/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;v1=1&amp;BBRecID=808377\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">View collection guide</a>\\n<p></p>","image":"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/files/original/2470ae3e27e127ba3b18873fd5412df5.jpg","lang":"Italian","pc":"1","pnr":"1","weight":"002099"},"219":{"transcription":"I wish you would write when & how you are a coming so that I may get fixt for you","id":"219","title":"Hannah Hayden letters, 1806-1866","date":["1806","1866"],"desc":"Hannah Hayden was born in Windsor, Connecticut, in 1778, and moved with her husband Hezekiah to Hartwick, Otsego County, New York in 1806, and then to Springfield, New York, in 1811.

Hitz was a lifelong resident of Indianapolis, where he died in 1949. A graduate of Indiana University, Mr. Hitz was devoted to the intellectual and charitable institutions of his state, and throughout his life he was an avid collector of books and manuscripts, particularly of explorations of the Middle West and the works of Mary Webb and Willa Cather. His collection of Cather first editions and Cather-related correspondence was sold to the Newberry Library after his death. <br /><br />Although born in Virginia in 1873, Willa Cather was transplanted to Nebraska when she was nine. Her life on the pioneering frontier of the Great Plains made a lasting impression on her, shaping her talent and interests as she became familiar with the struggles for survival of the immigrant farm families she came to know. Her observations and the kinship she felt for the new Americans of Nebraska was later reflected in much of her fiction, notably in two of her best-known novels, O Pioneers (1913) and My Antonia (1918). <br /><br />Cather graduated from the University of Nebraska in 1895 and began a career first as a teacher and then as a magazine editor, finally settling in New York City in 1906 as editor of McClure\'s Magazine.

Among other activities the Miner girls and Cather put on plays to entertain friends and families, and as the years passed they remained friends and correspondents. Irene Miner married Charles W. Weisz and spent her adult life in Chicago. <br /><br />Although Willa Cather was born in Virginia, in 1883 when she was 9, her father moved the family to Nebraska. This transition from the orderly South to the pioneering frontier of the Great Plains made a lasting impression on her and in her cultured but rather tomboyish youth she observed and became familiar with immigrant farm families struggling to conquer a sometimes hostile environment. The kinship she felt for the new Americans of Nebraska was later reflected in much of her fiction, notably in two of her best-known novels, O Pioneers! (1913) and My Antonia (1918). <br /><br />Cather graduated from the University of Nebraska in 1895 and began a career first as a teacher and then as a magazine editor, finally settling in New York City in 1906 as editor of McClure\'s Magazine.

What followed was a life dedicated to writing, one in which she published twelve novels and fifty-eight short stories that brought her much popularity and numerous honors and prizes. <br /><br />Cather never married but she developed and maintained many close and enduring friendships. Some of these, as with the Miner sisters dating from her early life in Red Cloud, Nebraska, lasted all her life. Though in her later years she suffered from bouts of poor health, writing remained her passion and she continued to publish, concluding with Saphira and the Slave Girl in 1940. <br /><br />Willa Cather, generally regarded as one of the twentieth century\'s major American writers, died in New York in 1947.<br /><br /><a href=\\"https://mms.newberry.org/xml/xml_files/CatherW.xml\\" target=\\"_blank\\" rel=\\"noreferrer\\">View collection guide</a>","image":"http://publications.newberry.org/transcription/mms-transcribe/files/original/d5e1467e5ff5f78b203c5e0458b4398c.jpg","pc":"9","weight":"009100"},"829":{"transcription":"Territory of Oklahoma \\nCOUNCIL CHAMBER, \\n(No 2)  Guthrie,    , 189\\nfoe, and hand-to-hand encounter win the day, or go down with colors flying.\\nYou have seen this class of fellows before, You have seen them at the bar of Justice, as petty Malefactors, who if, oppertunities of war had offered would have been among the most distinguesed scouts or heroes, Their very Natires made them love adventere, and they were wrong only because civilization willed it so.\\nTrusting you do not misinterpreted my meaning.
